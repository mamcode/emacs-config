The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As it charts his journey from provincial joker to maverick statesman, Benvenuto Presidente! has given viewers some much needed laughs at a time when real-life politics is every bit as strange as fiction, but certainly not as funny.</p><p>On Thursday, seven weeks after elections that resulted in little more than unbreakable gridlock, more than 1,000 politicians are due to gather in the lower house of parliament to start the process of electing a new president to replace Giorgio Napolitano, the widely respected former communist who, at the age of 87, has come to the end of his seven-year term.</p><p>The choice of a new head of state is always important, but this time, as the clock ticks and there is still no new government, it is crucial. It will be up to Napolitano's successor to see whether bickering politicians can be cajoled into forming a government or whether a return to the polls is the only way forward. Even for those with rather more political experience than Peppino, the challenge is daunting.</p><p>\"This election is extremely important because the president of the republic is in office for seven long years without interruption,\" said Gianfranco Pasquino, a leftwing political scientist and former senator. \"He has the power first to appoint the prime minister and second to dissolve parliament, so he is a very powerful man, especially because the [political] parties are very weak and there is no majority for any party or any single coalition.\"</p><p>Although a largely symbolic office, the Italian presidency has been likened to a concertina that can expand and contract according to need. In the past year and a half that need has been greater than ever. When Silvio Berlusconi's government collapsed in November 2011 it was Napolitano who drafted in Mario Monti and invited the economist to form a technocratic government.</p><p>In the long and anguished aftermath of February's election, \"King George\", as he has been dubbed by the media, has once again played a central role. But, due to constitutional restrictions on the powers of a president in his final six months in office, he has not been able to dissolve parliament and call new elections. So all eyes will be on his successor – but quite who that will be remains unclear.</p><p>What is always an obscure process cloaked in intrigue has become even more so this year as the presidency becomes a bargaining chip in the battle for a government. Any candidate will need broad support; in the first three rounds a two-thirds majority is needed, while thereafter the requirement falls to a simple majority.</p><p>It had been hoped that, if a president were elected with the backing of both Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left and Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right, the path to some form of new government might potentially run more smoothly. But , as Bersani threw his support behind Franco Marini, a prominent Catholic in the Democratic party (PD) and former speaker of the senate, the supposed \"consensus\" candidate immediately appeared to expose the deep faultlines within his own party.</p><p>While backed by Berlusconi's bloc and Monti's centrists, Marini's candidacy was vehemently opposed by Bersani's chief leadership rival, Matteo Renzi, who had already slated Marini earlier in the week and who declared last night that his presidency would do a \"disservice\" to the country.</p><p>There was speculation that elements of the centre-left unhappy with Marini could back the candidate of Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment Five Star Movement, Stefano Rodotà, a leftwing professor of law. The M5S had originally backed investigative journalist, Milena Gabanelli, but she politely but firmly declined.</p><p>Francesco Clementi, a constitutional expert and professor of law at the University of Perugia, said the election – which is carried out by secret ballot – would be a gauge of the various divisions in the PD. \"This will be a very interesting, very strange election in which we will be able to check the influences within the party,\" he said.  Among the other names suggested as potential candidates have been Giuliano Amato, a respected former prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, who in 1998 became the first former Communist to become prime minister of a Nato country, and Sergio Mattarella, a former deputy prime minister under D'Alema who is now a judge in Italy's constitutional court. Former prime minister Romano Prodi, championed by many on the centre-left, was dismissed outright by Berlusconi, who lost two elections to him.All predictions are made with caution. Observers compare the presidential election to the papal conclave and say that, just as he who is dubbed the greatest <em>papabile</em> usually exits a cardinal, so frontrunners for the Quirinale palace tend not to emerge as president-elect. The process can also be as lengthy as a conclave: while two presidents have been chosen with lightening speed on the first ballot, it ran to 16 rounds in 1992 and 23 in 1971.</p><p>Many Italians are watching the election with scepticism. Near the Quirinale, Tonino Giardini, a consultant, said on Tuesday that none of the potential candidates inspired much faith. \"We don't have anyone on Napolitano's level,\" he said. \"I'm looking, but I can't see anyone.\"</p><p>Over coffee in a nearby bar, Paolo Ganino, a 27-year-old journalism student based in London, bemoaned the paralysis. \"We need a government. I came back from England to vote to have a government, and I still don't have it. I have the government that was appointed by the president and not voted by anyone that is still in charge,\" he laughed, bitterly. Will the new president, whoever he or she is, be able to change much? Ganino, a PD voter, was not hopeful, suspecting that fresh elections would be on the cards before the year's end. \"It's a very difficult situation. I'm really into politics,\" he said. \"But I do not see a way out.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy\">Italy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mario-monti\">Mario Monti</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italian-elections-2013\">Italian elections 2013</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizzydavies\">Lizzy Davies</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems.

In Liverpool, the radical bookshop News from Nowhere said party packs – containing black balloons and party poppers with the politician's face on and bearing the legend: \"Still hate Thatcher\" – sold out in two days.</p><p>In Scotland, trade unionists and socialists were due to hold a rally on Wednesday evening to remember the \"industries and communities who suffered\" under her government\".</p><p>In London, protest organisers had called for people to silently turn their back on Thatcher's coffin. But as it came into view at 10.45am, there were shouts of \"What a waste of money\" and \"Tory scum\". Similar shouts at other points on the route were drowned out by pro-Thatcher clapping.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/17/margaret-thatcher-funeral-turning-my-back\" title=\"\">Rebecca Lush Blum</a> from Hampshire, who set up a Facebook group to organise the protest event on the route at Ludgate Circus, said she was pleased people had been allowed to voice anger at Thatcher's legacy.</p><p>\"We have shown the world that not everyone in this country thinks Margaret Thatcher was a great thing for this country … today felt like an important moment in the battle over what her legacy is and what sort of country we want so I'm pleased our voice was heard.\"</p><p>Police had told Blum the protest could go ahead and by 9.30am about 100 people had gathered at the normally busy junction in central London. As the first ceremonial military band went past just before 10am, there were boos and chants from protesters. Thatcher supporters – including one man wearing a suit and Thatcher T-shirt on a balcony overlooking the crowd – clapped and cheered.</p><p>Numbers of protesters swelled and by the time the coffin went by, police at the scene estimated there were about 300 protesters. The atmosphere was tense, with military personnel gathered at the other side of the road, clapping and cheering.</p><p>Dave Winslow, 22, an anthropology student from Durham – who was holding a placard reading \"Rest of us in Poverty\" and wearing a T-shirt with the messages \"Power to the people\" and \"Society does exist\" – was one of those who wanted a silent protest.</p><p>\"We want to maintain a dignified protest,\" he said. \"It's counterproductive to catcall and sing Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead. The message is that spending £10m on such a divisive figure in times of austerity, especially when austerity is being imposed on the poor, is wrong, especially when harm is being caused to the disabled and the NHS.\"</p><p>There was a big police presence with \"liaison officers\" mingling with the crowd and armed police guarding the barriers along the route. Surveillance officers took up positions on surrounding buildings.</p><p>Once the coffin had passed, some protesters were visibly moved. One man, who did not want to give his name, had tears in his eyes. He said: \"She ruined my family's life. She took my dad's job, everything … I promised myself I would come here for this day years ago.\"</p><p>Julie Guest, who had been in Iraq in 1998, said she pledged she would come when she saw a six-year-old Iraqi boy die because sanctions had stopped him getting medical treatment.</p><p>\"The consequences of her policies have spread a long way in this country and abroad and I said to myself when I saw that boy die that I would remember him when this day came.\"</p><p>The funeral procession passed within a few minutes and the crowd began to disperse. Police confirmed there were no arrests.</p><p>Blum, who had been besieged by media since an article about her planned protest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/14/thatcher-funeral-protesters-police\" title=\"\">appeared in the Guardian on Monday</a>, said she was pleased and moved by what had happened.</p><p>\"It's provocative to have a state funeral for such a controversial politician, and I wanted to remember and respect all those who suffered under Margaret Thatcher. I think we did that today.\"</p><p>A few miles south of St Paul's Cathedral, a group of 19- to 25-year-olds were discussing her legacy at Kids Company, a charity based in south London. Outside, the traffic was perhaps more modest than usual but otherwise it felt like a normal day. \"If it was Tony Blair, it might mean more to people,\" said Amee, 20. Still, she said, we are living in the world Thatcher created. \"Because of what she did, our benefits are dropping. Average working people can't afford to have a mortgage. Soon everything is going to belong to private companies. I look at my three-year-old and wonder how I'm going to put him through school.\"</p><p>\"If I have any respect for her it's because she was a fierce leader,\" said Monique, 21. \"She was decisive and stuck to her beliefs. Most politicians today are wishy-washy but she kept her word.\" Amee added: \"She did a lot to affect the whole system and how it works. She is still in the system even though she is out of power; even though she is dead.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest\">Protest</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matthewtaylor\">Matthew Taylor</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullewis\">Paul Lewis</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil. Let's kill them all\" after the attacks, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslims-are-evil-lets-kill-them-all-us-tv-commentator-erik-rush-provokes-furious-reaction-with-boston-bombing-twitter-rants-8575176.html\">provoking a furious reaction on Twitter</a>. Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Witnesses told police the driver had warned them there was a problem, as the coach veered off the road and smashed into overhanging rocks. Some passengers escaped from the burning vehicle by breaking the windows and jumping out. The survivors were flown back to the UK on Wednesday on a specially chartered flight that left Grenoble airport at around 16.00 local time.</p><p>The driver, who worked for Classic Coaches, based in Country Durham, was transporting 53 people from the Alpine resort of Alpe d'Huez back to the UK. The steep and winding road, known as the Route Napoléon, links Cannes with Grenoble through the Alps. With its 21 bends it is often used as one of the stages of the celebrated Tour de France cycle race.</p><p>Jean Rampon, director of the local prefect's office, said: \"The bus was descending and the drive had the time to warn the passengers that he had a problem with the brakes. He hit the rocks and the bus caught fire.\"</p><p>Transport minister Frédéric Cuvillier visited the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening and praised the \"remarkable courage\" of the driver, whose action, he said, had \"saved many lives\". He said the position of the vehicle suggested the driver had tried to slow the vehicle down by hitting the rock rather than risking it veering off the road into a ravine.</p><p>\"The driver showed remarkable courage. The witnesses all agree that his acts and his attitude meant a much heavier loss of life was avoided,\" Cuvillier said.</p><p>The Grenoble public prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat said it appeared \"very probable that this was a problem with the brakes\".</p><p>\"Now the question is why and it will be a long inquiry,\" he told journalists.</p><p>Several hours after the accident, the burned-out coach could be seen hanging over the edge of the mountain road. Empty and charred suitcases along with clothes and personal belongings were scattered around.</p><p>The passengers were said to be \"seasonal ski workers\" aged around 25 returning to Britain after the resorts closed. Around 100,000 seasonal workers make the annual pilgrimage to the northern Alpine region.</p><p>\"When we arrived, people had got out (of the vehicle) by themselves,\" said one rescuer who said it was a scene of panic with passengers screaming and crying.</p><p>The driver was killed, and three other passengers seriously injured. A further 26 were described as slightly injured\". The remainder escaped unharmed. A woman who was seriously burned has been taken to the specialist burns unit at the Edouard Herriot hospital in the city of Lyon. The two other injured passengers are in the general hospital at Grenoble, one in intensive care and the other in a surgical ward.</p><p>In total, 80 firefighters in 30 vehicles and 45 gendarmes were mobilised.</p><p>The most serious recent coach accident in the Alps was in July 2007, when 26 Polish pilgrims were killed and 14 others injured when their vehicle crashed and caught fire in a ravine at Vizille in the Isere after leaving the road.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport\">Road transport</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france\">France</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kim-willsher\">Kim Willsher</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They include members of the New IRA's political wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement.</p><p>Several hundred people attended the party, with the police keeping a discreet distance from the crowds, the majority of whom were young men in their twenties and teens.</p><p>There have been outbreaks of rioting following previous Thatcher-death parties. But youth workers and residents on the Fountain estate said they were just praying the day of Thatcher's funeral would pass quickly.</p><p>Inside the Cathedral Youth Club, within sight of Derry's ancient walls, Graham Warke and Phillip Jackson said they were dreading Wednesday night, given earlier republican street celebrations. The district has come under attack for six nights in a row.</p><p>\"I just can't wait to get this day over with,\" Warke said. \"Residents here are dreading what will happen later.\"</p><p>Warke played video footage taken on his smartphone of six nights of violent attacks on the small estate. It included very young boys wearing hoodies and football scarves throwing petrol bombs over the city's walls and at police patrols.</p><p>Jackson said most people on the Fountain, a small district covered in union flags that is home to the last 400 Protestant residents on Derry's West Bank, were \"repulsed\" over the celebrations.</p><p>\"People on this estate and in all loyalist parts of Londonderry are asking 'how low can these people go by celebrating someone dying?'\"</p><p>Jackson claimed he saw older men orchestrating the rioting directed at his area. \"Those mocking Mrs Thatcher's death are behaving like animals; it is disgusting the way they get on,\" he added.</p><p>Amid all the hatred expressed against Thatcher, a man who personifies peace and non-violent resistance had arrived in the city.</p><p>The Dalai Lama had come to Derry ahead of a symbolic event leading a cross-community walk across Derry's new Peace Bridge over the river Foyle.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland\">Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/derry\">Derry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/northernireland\">Northern Irish politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dalailama\">Dalai Lama</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald\">Henry McDonald</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chinese bank ICBC ousted Exxon Mobil as the world's biggest company, according to the magazine's 10th annual ranking of the world's top 2,000 firms. China Construction Bank bumped JP Morgan out of the second spot.</p><p>The US had a total of 543 members in the list this year, 19 more firms than last year and the highest total since 2009.

Exxon, last year's No 1, slipped into fourth place this year behind the two Chinese firms, JP Morgan and General Electric. Apple eclipsed Exxon as the most valuable company by market capitalization last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/25/exxon-apple-most-valuable-stock\">and the two have vied for pole position ever since</a>. Apple slipped behind Exxon once more on Wednesday.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said. Simons said he expected Congress would have to address the imbalance and that the ruling was likely to lead to more not less litigation.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royaldutchshell\">Royal Dutch Shell</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy\">US foreign policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I intensely disliked the Ba'ath party and most of the ministers who formed the government then. So I have no bias towards the Ba'ath and the president who took over from his father. The trouble is that most of the reporting from Syria comes from sources stationed among the insurgents, who include, for example, the Jabhat al-Nusra, which has just declared its loyalty to al-Qaida, and extremist Sunnis opposed to the Alawites, the president's sect, and have anti-democratic and anti-western views. They don't enjoy support from minorities like the Christians and the Ismailis.</p><p>At last the Guardian has a man in Damascus and can report the regime's version.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/syrian-minister-uk-france-al-qaida?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> Ian Black</a> (15 April) is sensibly cautious. His account of the bombing which damaged the central bank clearly suggests that the bomb came from the insurgents; and more frankly he says that another bomb, killing 80 people, exploded near a Ba'ath headquarters and was blamed on Jabhat al-Nusra. Why our government can help the French to fight al-Qaida in Mali and simultaneously send assistance to its supporters in Syria is difficult to understand. We should be neutral and keep far away from the Syrian struggle.<br /><strong>James Craig</strong><br /><em>Standlake, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Much of your reporting on Syria could have been written by GW Bush: the same old rebels are good, the Syrian government is bad recipe. The Syrian reality seems a little simpler. Syria is crawling with foreign jihadists and it would be exceedingly naive to assume that the special forces of the countries supplying the weapons are not there also – France, the US, UK, various Arab despots?</p><p>Meanwhile, most Syrians in Syria want the killing to stop so they can live their lives without fear. They wanted a negotiated settlement from the Kofi Annan plan, but this was flagrantly obstructed and torpedoed by the west. For Syria read Libya.  <br /><strong>Khalid Mahmood-Chohan</strong><br /><em>Watford, Hertfordshire</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida\">al-Qaida</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Evidence released by the Venezuelan government includes an email sent from Armando Briquet, of Capriles's campaign team, to Guillermo Salas, of Esdata, which reports on Venezuela's electoral process, stating \"we need everything set out in Washington for checking over by the [Capriles campaign] (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/venezuela-opposition-protest-maduro-victory?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 17 April). It's necessary that all documentation is presented if we decide to take the road of not recognising the results\". Nicolas Maduro won Sunday's elections by 1.8%, 262,000 votes. Capriles only won the governorship of Miranda in December last year by 40,000 votes, and both sides accepted the results and the transparency of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council. Chávez lost the constitutional reform referendum in 2007 by a narrower margin, 1.4%, and accepted the result. With a turnout of just under 79%, the results mean 40% of the Venezuelan electorate voted for Maduro, more than Thatcher in 1979 (33%), Blair in 1997 (31%), Cameron in 2010 (23%), Obama in 2008 (30%) and Attlee in 1945 (36%).

There are a number of areas that urgently need to be addressed. First, how is it that none of these banking issues appear to have been identified by the auditors, in their \"going concern\" assessments. Is it reasonable to expect regulators to know more about what is going on inside an organisation than an auditor? Regulators can help protect consumer interests through pricing regulation but, if they are really involved with detailed internal process assessment, what are the auditors doing? Perhaps the auditing function should also have a formal responsibility to customers, as well as to shareholders.</p><p>Second, there is scope for a major investigation into how banks actually add value to society. In essence, the sectors' profits and bonuses are ultimately paid for by their customers.</p><p>Third, there is a need to investigate the extent to which \"selling\" is, almost by definition, unprofessional. The concept of being professional should mean that the interests of the customer/client come first. Where the seller operates within an incentive structure that benefits both the seller and others in their organisation, the net result will almost inevitably be defined as mis-selling.</p><p>The horrific consequences that have arisen in such areas as PPI etc, probably also apply to much of the pay-day loan industry, as well as a significant part of international lending. A major inquiry into the nature and future of the finance sector is long overdue, but there are also many important questions urgently in need of further research.<br /><strong>Emeritus professor Bruce Lloyd</strong><br /><em>South Bank University</em></p><p></p><p>• It is obvious many of the top executives of the failed banks had no actual financial expertise; they are like someone pretending to be a doctor, or a fake architect whose buildings collapse, guilty of misrepresentation. The regulator may be surprised no bank bosses have faced charges – we all are. <br /><strong>Tony Cheney</strong><br /><em>Ipswich, Suffolk </em></p><p></p><p>• As a research and advocacy group that has for years called attention to the murky world of tax havens, we welcome your report (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/03/offshore-secrets-offshore-tax-haven?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Leaks reveal secrets of the rich who hide cash offshore</a>, 4 April). But you should also have dispelled the myth advocated by some proponents that tax havens promote greater tax efficiency through competition; the evidence in economic literature is scanty at best. What is clear is that this benefit has not been enough to prevent tax havens from going bankrupt.</p><p>In September 2009, the Cayman Islands, one of the largest, faced bankruptcy and was unable to pay its government employees. Britain, which oversees the territory, was forced to bail out the Cayman authorities. Recently, Cyprus went belly up and had to be rescued by the EU, ECB, and IMF.</p><p>Investors need to realise that the lack of prudential regulations and oversight allows tax havens to pass on the cost-savings to them as higher returns. But with higher returns come higher risks. They implicitly accepted those risks when they invested in tax havens. In the event the financial risks pile up – as they inevitably must – and the house of cards comes crashing down, investors should not expect taxpayers to foot the bill. <br /><strong>Dev Kar</strong><br /><em>Lead economist, </em><a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Financial Integrity</em></a><em>, Washington DC</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking\">Banking</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/caymanislands\">Cayman Islands</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus\">Cyprus</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The sun is out and, despite the blasting wind, the bite in the air has departed. After a delay of a month the energy is now bursting out and Titchmarsh Wood is springing into life. Among the small oaks, blossoming sallow and hazel coppice, great tits, chiffchaffs, bullfinches, redpoll, and many other small birds urgently broadcast their individual churrs, cheeps and twitters. The recent weather must have been immensely trying for the resident birds; many will have perished as they struggled to maintain body heat on intermittent invertebrate food supplies. The survivors, joined by recent arrivals from transcontinental travels, sound like they are making up for lost time.</p><p>Splashes of primroses colour the verges but the trees are still in bud. Only the most sheltered blackthorn bushes are in bud burst; blossom and leaves breaking out at the same moment. The bluebells and patches of wild garlic are in leaf but nowhere near being in flower. For weeks I have been scanning for brimstone butterflies, the little fluttering yellow flags that would signal the end of the reign of white. Today the brimstones are out, careering up and down the rides. Peacocks and small tortoiseshells are also active, some feeding on yellow puffs of sallow blossom. Portly queen bumblebees pipe up sallow nectar and burn off the sugar flying low over the ground, hunting for suitable small mammal burrows in which to establish their nests. The insects are back, the numbers are perhaps low, but after their long hibernation it is good to see and hear them again.</p><p>The ground is waterlogged and the path churned; overhead are the plaintive cries of a pair of buzzards and a pair of red kites. The soaring, diving and banking birds of prey wheel in the sky as if acting out an aerial dogfight. As with the finches, warblers and tits, the race is on to secure the choicest nesting spots and feeding territories. The lines for another breeding season are being drawn.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs\">Rural affairs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/birds\">Birds</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/animals\">Animals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/insects\">Insects</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-shardlow\">Matt Shardlow</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Still, academics and journalists need each other</p><p>It's a good thing the BBC did not send its undercover reporter to North Korea with a group of students from Oxford University. Otherwise Oxford's chancellor, Chris Patten, would have had to send a strongly worded letter of protest to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Chris Patten. \"I cannot understand how you could allow …\"</p><p>I refer, of course, to the row about journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/why-is-lse-making-fuss-over-panorama\" title=\"\">John Sweeney travelling to North Korea</a> with a group of students from the London School of Economics on undercover assignment for the BBC's Panorama. Compared with working out if there is a real threat of nuclear war from the world's last full-dress totalitarian state, this may seem like a storm in a British teacup. But it prompts us to reflect on how we can discover what nasty, secretive regimes are up to, without sacrificing our own values and endangering others along the way.</p><p>As someone who has spent a good chunk of his life trying to do just that, in&nbsp;journalism and in academia, I've been&nbsp;interested in responses on both sides of the academia-journalism fence. I start from a strong sympathy with the undercover reporter. We owe no duty of&nbsp;honesty to tyrants. There is nothing to compare with being there, on the spot. The first article I ever published was a report based on joining a \"Progressive Tour\" to Albania, then suffering under a totalitarian regime with a strong resemblance to today's North Korea. If Sweeney had embedded himself in one of the tours that travel regularly to North Korea, as other journalists have, he would deserve only praise. But he didn't, and no one comes out of this story very well.</p><p>The LSE had legitimate grounds for concern. It seems that a few of those on the trip had not been told about their journalistic accompaniment. The&nbsp;students subsequently received bullying emails from a North Korean official, threatening to publish their \"personal data\" because they had broken North Korean law. If any of them&nbsp;wanted to pursue an academic career in North Korean studies, this would not be a good start. But the LSE's highly public reaction was over the top, and arguably counterproductive.</p><p>The BBC's expert prior assessment, which concluded that the students risked at most brief detention and expulsion, was probably about right. The LSE made virtually no acknowledgement of the genuine public interest in such a journalistic investigation. Its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9994533/LSE-BBCs-Panorama-decision-extremely-regrettable.html\" title=\"\">call for the programme not to be broadcast</a> at all was ridiculous. Its thermonuclear response must draw the attention of every authoritarian regime to the journalistic worm that might be hidden in any LSE study group. A strong private protest to the BBC would have been best.</p><p>The BBC exhibited that proclivity for weak and contorted compromise that seems to be a hallmark of its recent management. If it had got written, informed consent from everyone on the trip, as its own editorial guidelines suggest, then no reasonable person could have complained. \"Students are adults, after all,\" as a former head of Oxford's department of politics and international relations exclaimed. Instead, most of them seem to have been partially informed, apparently in individual conversations with the reporter's wife (an LSE alumna, who was organising the trip) and the cameraman. But even those students were not fully&nbsp;informed – for their own protection, BBC managers said.</p><p>This is inconsistent and silly. It's the&nbsp;same <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/bbc-caves-thatcher-song-ding-dong\" title=\"\">muddled management style which led to only a tiny clip</a> from Ding&nbsp;Dong! The Witch is Dead, virally&nbsp;promoted online as a posthumous insult to Margaret Thatcher, being&nbsp;played on Radio 1's chart show, together with a spoken explanation of the background. For God's sake, Auntie, make up your mind. Either play the bloody song or don't. Either get the students' consent or don't.</p><p>As for Sweeney Agonistes, one can see why the fact that his wife was organising this trip for an LSE student society was tempting. But a whizz around the BBC website reveals a story posted just five days before the Panorama broadcast, explaining the possibilities of tourism to North Korea. One satisfied customer describes himself as an \"adventure tourist\". An expert on Pyongyang's nuclear programme tells me that when he spoke at a foreign correspondents' club in London, half the journalists in the room seemed to have visited North Korea on such tours.</p><p>Moreover, the value added by the Panorama programme did not match its hype. It was interesting to see what foreigners are shown – a chilly model hospital with no patients, for example – and a few blurry glimpses of what they are not shown: the miserable poor, squatting in ditches. But most of the real insights came from experts and defectors interviewed outside the country. \"So, welcome to the real North Korea\" declared Sweeney dramatically, standing inside a barbed wire fence apparently built to keep ordinary people away from his tour group's hotel. Cut to a long-distance shot of some miserable-looking apartment buildings. But he wasn't in the real North Korea; he was in a Potemkin village inn. Back in downtown Pyongyang, he teetered over the edge into self-parody, intoning \"something's going on … you can feel the tension rising. The problem is, it's impossible for us to ask what's really happening. We don't know.\"</p><p>Contrast this with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/15/nothing-to-envy-barbara-demick\" title=\"\">Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy</a>, which carefully and movingly tells the personal stories of six North Koreans, based on extensive interviews and all other available sources. Demick, a journalist with a decade's experience in the region, makes extensive acknowledgement to fellow correspondents, academics and experts of all kinds. The result is a fantastic book, which gives us some of the truth that North Korea's progressive tour guides are paid to hide. Moral of the story? It's precisely in those secretive, nasty places that real knowledge only comes from years of hard work by journalists and academics alike, sharing the fruits of their complementary crafts.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timothygartonash\">Timothy Garton Ash</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There will be road-blocks everywhere.\"</p><p>But pro-democracy protesters opposed to Sunday's race have also been frustrated by increased security measures which have driven them out of the capital, Manama. Shehabi said: \"There was a blanket ban on all protests after last year's grand prix. People have been forced underground now. Protesters have been pushed to parts of small villages where they can't be heard or seen. As long as you're not seen or heard by anyone it's OK.</p><p>\"There is a continuation of government repression. We haven't seen justice or accountability for the F1 staff who were sacked and arrested and tortured in 2011. They were tortured at the circuit itself.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Jean Todt, president of the FIA, Formula One's governing body, has at last broken his silence in a letter to local NGOs concerning the Bahrain Grand Prix. In it, he said: \"It is our firm belief that sport, and the F1 grand prix, can have a positive and healing effect in situations where conflict, social unrest and tensions are causing distress.\"</p><p>Shehabi said: \"We have asked for 200 tickets for the race so protesters can make their point peacefully. But we won't be allowed within a mile of the circuit.\"</p><p>Said Yousif, spokesman for the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, said: \"There has been a government crackdown here and it started two weeks ago, especially in the villages close to the F1 track, and 65 people have been arrested.  Leaders have been beaten and tortured before being released, so everyone can see the marks of beating and torture. Houses have been razed in different villages. Tear gas has been used at close range. No one has died, as happened last year, but the crackdown has continued. I was in jail for a month three months ago just because I tweeted an injury in the capital.\"</p><p>Sheikh Ali Salman, leader of the Shia Muslim-led group al-Wefaq, has asked for an increase in peaceful protests. \"I am calling for more peaceful protests,\" he said. \"I am calling on people to share peaceful protests to send a message to the world about our demand for peaceful democratic reform. I am against violence. Our protest is to take place today, tomorrow and on Friday. It is not against the race itself.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formula-one-2013\">Formula One 2013</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bahrain\">Bahrain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/motorsports\">Motor sport</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulweaver\">Paul Weaver</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination,\" he told a local television channel after the discovery of the bodies of Mike and Cynthia McLelland at their home in a town east of Dallas on 30 March. They had been shot multiple times. Williams wished the police luck. \"I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act,\" he said.</p><p>The authorities now think they have the culprits. In the early hours of Wednesday, Williams' wife, Kim, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/texas-da-murders-justice-wife-arrested\">was arrested and charged with the murders of the McLellands and another prosecutor, Mark Hasse, in January</a>. According to her arrest warrant, she identified her husband as the shooter. He was already in the Kaufman County jail on a $3m bond, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/13/texas-da-murder-arrest-threat\">accused of sending an anonymous email containing a \"terroristic threat\"</a>.</p><p>Investigators had met Eric Williams in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant near his home in Kaufman, taken his cellphone and swabbed his hands to test for gun residue. His then-attorney repeatedly maintained that <a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/04/03/i-team-former-kaufman-co-official-talks-about-his-involvement-in-da-murder-cases/\">the disgraced former justice of the peace had nothing to do with the killings and was co-operating with police</a>.</p><p>But at a brief media conference on Wednesday afternoon, police released an affidavit alleging that Kim Williams had confessed to the murders and had implicated her husband. She was arrested and charged with capital murder, which potentially carries the death penalty. The 46-year-old is being held on a $10m bond.</p><p>\"Out of respect for the families of the victims, during this time, we are not answering any questions at this briefing until we're able to brief the family on the events of the past several days,\" Justin Lewis, a Kaufman County sheriff's department spokesman, told reporters.</p><p>In the absence of a firm suspect in the days following the deaths of the McLellands, who were both in their 60s, speculation had swirled that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/01/white-supremacist-group-linked-texas-da\">a prison gang such as the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas or a Mexican drug cartel might be responsible</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/04/colorado-texas-gang-white-supremacists\">The Texas governor, Rick Perry, arrived on the scene to announce a $200,000 reward for key information</a> and used an interview with Fox News to raise the issue of border security.</p><p><br />With no one claiming responsibility and officials apparently struggling for leads, tension was thick in Kaufman County, a large rural area about a half-hour drive south-east of Dallas. The McLellands' memorial (above) and funeral services took place amid an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, with a vast police presence including snipers on the roof of the church that held the memorial.</p><p>Now, if the authorities are proved right, the killings may have been prompted by something as simple as a feud between small-town political rivals that spiraled far out of control.</p><p>Beneath the dramatic and alarming talk of powerful and brutal international gangs bringing lethal force to a quiet community, there had been isolated hints of resentment towards McLelland's bombastic brand of law enforcement. On 5 April, the day that the McLellands were buried, a Kaufman County man was arrested and charged with making a threat on Facebook. The post allegedly said that another district attorney \"will soon perish\" and that staff in McLelland's office were not interested in \"actual guilt or innocence\" and were \"reaping what they have sown\". It followed the unconnected arrest earlier that week of another local man, who allegedly made threats against a Kaufman County official via a Crimestoppers hotline. <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/05/4752787/second-man-accused-of-making-threats.html\">Neither was a murder suspect</a>.</p><p>McLelland and Hasse prosecuted Eric Williams on charges of stealing three computer monitors from an office building in 2011. In December that year, Williams' lawyer tried unsuccessfully to remove McLelland and his staff from the case, claiming that the district attorney felt personal animosity towards Williams, stemming from an advertisement critical of McLelland that had run in local newspapers in 2006. That year, McLelland unsuccessfully ran for election as district attorney. He won the vote in 2010 and set about building a reputation as <a href=\"http://www.kaufmanherald.com/news/article_2775d76b-e0b2-5041-bb3c-84cd1365654f.html\">a hardliner who would destroy \"the good ol' boy network\"</a>.</p><p>During the trial, the prosecutors depicted Williams, above, as a violent, untrustworthy man. He was found guilty by a jury in March 2012, received two years' probation and lost his law license and his job as an elected justice of the peace. He was in the process of appealing the verdict when the McLellands died. Last week, Kim Williams told the Dallas Morning News that the couple have chronic health problems, no longer have health insurance and have been under financial stress.</p><p>Hasse, an assistant district attorney, was shot dead one block from the Kaufman County courthouse, on his way to work on 31 January. Standing outside the courthouse in his favorite wide-brimmed black cowboy hat, McLelland told reporters in a press conference that he would find the \"scum\" responsible.</p><p>The murders prompted speculation that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas may have carried out the crimes in retaliation for the prosecutors' involvement in a racketeering case brought in Houston last year against more than 30 gang members. In response to the killings in Forney, 21 miles from downtown Dallas, police stepped up protection for prosecutors across the state and one attorney withdrew from the racketeering case, apparently over security concerns.</p><p>Eric Williams has not been publicly named as a suspect by officials or been charged in connection with the deaths. But the 46-year-old allegedly emailed an anonymous threat to officers a day after the McLellands were found dead. According to the sheriff's office, the email suggested that if certain demands were not met, there would be another attack.</p><p>Towards the end of last week, the investigation seemed to be focusing more narrowly on Eric and Kim Williams. One official told the Associated Press that Eric Williams had a storage locker containing at least 20 weapons and that a Ford Crown Victoria car similar to one spotted in the McLellands' neighborhood on the day they died was also found at the facility in Seagoville, 15 miles west of Williams' home.</p><p>Today's affidavit states: \"Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office … both Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland regularly carried handguns after the Eric Williams jury trial because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-dart\">Tom Dart</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The LSE's public criticism sharpened after Tony Hall, the BBC director general, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/14/bbc-north-korea-panorama-film\" title=\"\">flatly rejected</a> the university's demands not to broadcast the film. Sweeney's Panorama aired as planned on BBC1 on Monday night.</p><p>The dispute is over whether the BBC had given the 10 students on the Pyongyang trip enough information about the risks of travelling with undercover journalists.</p><p>In the statement released on Wednesday night, six students backed the BBC and said they had no objection to the Panorama broadcast.</p><p>They said: \"When the story broke to the international media in response to a complaint about the trip, not all of us were consulted by the LSE, or their representatives, for our own accounts. Some of us have still not been consulted. We therefore feel compelled to establish the basic facts of the case, many of which have been distorted in the media, in this joint statement.\"</p><p>The students said they were told in London that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if they were rumbled. In Beijing, before they flew to Pyongyang, they were informed that Sweeney was the journalist and that he worked for the BBC, they said. They were also joined by Sweeney's wife, Tomiko Newson, who organised the trip, and a BBC cameraman.</p><p>Sweeney's Panorama film, North Korea Undercover, has been the subject of 348 complaints to the BBC since the public row broke out. Of these, about 150 were made before the documentary was broadcast.</p><p>The media regulator Ofcom has received fewer than 10 complaints.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josh-halliday\">Josh Halliday</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That figure  is likely to reach at least 10 million, more than half the pre-war population of the country.</p><p>Another UN body, Unicef, says half of those currently in need are children.</p><p>\"I don't remember any other crisis where we are having 8,000 per day [fleeing across borders], every day since February,\" Guterres said in an interview with the Guardian. \"There will very likely be 3.5 million by the end of the year. We will have half the population of Syria in dire need of assistance and this is incomprehensible.</p><p>With the civil war now into its third year and increasingly taking the shape of a proxy regional war fought on a sectarian faultline, aid groups are making ever more strident predictions of a catastrophic funding shortfall.</p><p>Guterres goes further, warning that the modern boundaries of the Middle East and the post-Ottoman agreements that underpin them may unravel if the crisis is not brought to an end.</p><p>\"The political geography of the modern Middle East emerged from the Sykes Picot agreement with the exception of the never-resolved Israeli-Palestinian situation,\" he said of the Anglo-French deal at the end of the first world war that eventually formed the nation states of Syria and Lebanon. \"The conflict in Syria might for the first time put that political geography into question.\"</p><p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, this week both warned of a partition of the country that would inevitably cause grave ramifications in neighbouring Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and beyond.</p><p>Kerry appeared to advance the US position on Syria by suggesting an \"enclave break-up\" could only be prevented by getting \"everybody on the same page with respect to what post-Assad Syria will look like\".</p><p>Assad, meanwhile, reiterated his earlier warning that no country in the region would be safe if the Syrian war, in which a majority Sunni opposition is fighting a minority Alawite regime aligned to Shia Islam, led to the collapse of the embattled state's  borders.</p><p>UNHCR figures show that close to 1.3 million Syrians have fled the country in the past two years. The figure is markedly less than the numbers that left Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade, but is increasing at a faster rate  than at any point in either country.</p><p>In addition, there are thought to be at least 3 million internally displaced Syrian refugees, many of whom have limited means to provide for themselves or their families.

We have the Palestinian/Israeli question and the fact that the Syrian army has withdrawn from the Golan Heights.

Russia and China, two permanent members of the security council, have blocked moves towards more robust support of the opposition in Syria.

It struck close to Ya'an, a city of 1.5 million people west of the provincial capital, Chengdu, at about 8am local time.</p><p>The China Earthquake Administration said at least 124 people had died. The government of Ya'an city, which administers Lushan, said more than 2,600 people were injured, 330 of them seriously.</p><p>Officials said almost all the buildings in Longmen village collapsed during the minute-long tremor. \"It was such a big quake that everyone was scared,\" a woman who answered a phone at a nursery told the Associated Press. \"We all fled for our lives.\"</p><p>Nearly 10,000 houses throughout Lushan county were damaged. In some areas, roads were cut off, power failed and telecoms service was intermittent. Rescuers used dynamite to clear boulders that had fallen across roads in order to reach Longmen and other damaged areas lying farther up the mountain valleys, state media reported.</p><p>More than 6,000 soldiers have been dispatched to aid rescue efforts in the mountainous area. China's president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Keqiang, called an emergency meeting to co-ordinate the response and Li has flown to the disaster zone to supervise work, the official broadcaster reported.</p><p>Initial reports suggested the worst damage was in rural villages around Ya'an, which lies on the edge of the Tibetan plateau. The state news agency Xinhua reported major building collapses and damaged roads in Shuangshi and Longmen townships.</p><p>Footage on China Central Television showed a makeshift triage centre in a square outside Lushan county hospital where medical personnel bandaged bleeding victims. A man who answered the phone at the Jiajia Hotel in Ya'an said many houses had collapsed and many people were injured.</p><p>Another man living nearby said officials and company bosses had evacuated everyone to outdoor spaces. \"It is very chaotic everywhere and people have no idea what we can do,\" he said. \"We were the frontline of [the 2008] earthquake, so in most companies, departments or organisations there are emergency resources, but we need more. Hopefully we can get over it soon, and it won't be as bad as last time.\"</p><p>Chinese seismologists recorded the quake at magnitude 7, while the US Geological Survey <a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usb000gcdd#summary\" title=\"\">recorded it at magnitude 6.6 at a depth of 12km</a>.

It struck close to Ya'an, a city of 1.5 million people west of the provincial capital, Chengdu, at about 8am local time.</p><p>The China Earthquake Administration said at least 124 people had died. The government of Ya'an city, which administers Lushan, said more than 2,600 people were injured, 330 of them seriously.</p><p>Officials said almost all the buildings in Longmen village collapsed during the minute-long tremor. \"It was such a big quake that everyone was scared,\" a woman who answered a phone at a nursery told the Associated Press. \"We all fled for our lives.\"</p><p>Nearly 10,000 houses throughout Lushan county were damaged. In some areas, roads were cut off, power failed and telecoms service was intermittent. Rescuers used dynamite to clear boulders that had fallen across roads in order to reach Longmen and other damaged areas lying farther up the mountain valleys, state media reported.</p><p>More than 6,000 soldiers have been dispatched to aid rescue efforts in the mountainous area. China's president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Keqiang, called an emergency meeting to co-ordinate the response and Li has flown to the disaster zone to supervise work, the official broadcaster reported.</p><p>Initial reports suggested the worst damage was in rural villages around Ya'an, which lies on the edge of the Tibetan plateau. The state news agency Xinhua reported major building collapses and damaged roads in Shuangshi and Longmen townships.</p><p>Footage on China Central Television showed a makeshift triage centre in a square outside Lushan county hospital where medical personnel bandaged bleeding victims. A man who answered the phone at the Jiajia Hotel in Ya'an said many houses had collapsed and many people were injured.</p><p>Another man living nearby said officials and company bosses had evacuated everyone to outdoor spaces. \"It is very chaotic everywhere and people have no idea what we can do,\" he said. \"We were the frontline of [the 2008] earthquake, so in most companies, departments or organisations there are emergency resources, but we need more. Hopefully we can get over it soon, and it won't be as bad as last time.\"</p><p>Chinese seismologists recorded the quake at magnitude 7, while the US Geological Survey <a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usb000gcdd#summary\" title=\"\">recorded it at magnitude 6.6 at a depth of 12km</a>. The USGS said it appeared to be on the Longmenshan fault, the source of 2008's 7.9-magnitude shock.</p><p>Residents in Chengdu and Chongqing, hundreds of miles away, fled their buildings as they felt the tremor and repeated aftershocks.

The pair had been identified as suspects in Monday's double bomb attack on the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 170.</p><p>For about two hours on Friday night, Tsarnaev was surrounded by Swat teams and hundreds of other officers, surviving a barrage of gunfire and flash grenades.

The Tsarnaevs' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-brothers-parents-innocent-124/\">told Russia Today </a>that the FBI had been in contact with Tamarlan Tsarnaev for between three and five years. </p><p>In the US there were multiple reports that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57580534/fbi-interviewed-dead-boston-bombing-suspect-years-ago/\">FBI officials admitted interviewing him</a> in 2011 on behalf of a foreign government, most likely Russia. The Tsarnaev family were ethnic Chechens; Moscow brutally put down the independence movement in Chechnya during two wars in the 1990s.</p><p>Tsarnaev's apprehension brings to an end five days of high anxiety that began at 2.50pm on Monday, with the blasts, 12 seconds apart, near the finish line of the Boston marathon. The FBI say the brothers had dropped bags containing bombs made from pressure cookers packed with nails and ball bearings.</p><p>A breakthrough in the case came on Thursday evening when police identified two suspects and published their photorgraphs. The drama unfolded quickly: at about 10.30pm on Thursday the two brothers, of Chechen origin, ambushed a police officer, Sean Collier, 26, on the campus of MIT. They then carjacked a black Mercedes, sparking a car chase with police that ended with a huge gunfight in Watertown. </p><p>Pipe bombs and other explosive devices were thrown by the suspects. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed, but Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped on foot.</p><p>More than a million residents of Boston and the surrounding towns had been told to stay inside their homes for most of Friday as hundreds of law enforcement officers went door to door in Watertown searching for Tsarnaev. </p><p>The final flurry of frenzied police activity began shortly before 7pm on Friday, just minutes after police chiefs had come before the TV cameras and told the residents of Watertown that they were ending the lockdown, despite admitting that they had lost track of the suspect.</p><p>A renewed bout of gunfire of about 30 rounds ripped through Watertown as Swat teams and dozens of police vehicles raced to the area of Birch Road, a leafy street with about 14 houses in it. Police immediately ordered people in Watertown to stay indoors, while officers evacuated nearby households, helping families flee across an adjacent field.</p><p>A resident of Watertown had called police to report he had found a man covered in blood hiding in the boat standing in the yard of a house in Birch Road. Officers exchanged gunfire with the Tsarnaev as they surrounded the boat. There was no chance this time that he could escape.</p><p>It is now believed that Tsarnaev may have been holed up in the boat all day, eluding the door-to-door search that was going on elsewhere. Birch Road is just a couple of blocks outside the 20-block exclusion zone that the police had set up early on Friday in an attempt to contain the suspect.</p><p>Amid fears that Tsarnaev may have been wearing a suicide vest or carrying explosives, officers were extremely cautious about moving in. As darkness fell, the barrage of forces ringed around the boat was reinforced by specialist FBI squads dressed in full military gear, wearing protective helmets and vests and equipped with nightvision goggles. Bomb disposal experts, equipped with a robot, were also brought in.</p><p>Police used a helicopter to monitor the boat from overhead, reporting early in the operation that there was visible movement coming from underneath the tarp, suggesting that Tsarnaev was at that point still alive. Minutes before 8pm there were flashes of light and booms thought to be grenades thrown into the boat.</p><p>Around 150 people had gathered at the end of nearby Franklin Street to watch the police operation. Most were neighbours who lived within one or two blocks. Many had waited here for an hour or more after hearing police had the second suspect cornered.</p><p>The first sign that Tsarnaev might have been taken into custody came when a uniformed officer walked away from the top of Franklin Street and vigorously clapped the hand of a fellow official. He looked down at the ground and clapped his hands two or three times.</p><p>The crowd read the signal and broke out into applause, cheering. \"Did you get him?\" one man shouted. An officer nodded his head. The cheers intensified.</p><p>\"It feels great,\" said Bill Forbush, who two blocks away from where Tsarnaev was apprehended. He and his wife, Ann, had been standing on the corner for an hour and a half. They had heard the first gunshots, and heard the sounds of what reportedly were flash bang grenades. They had  spent 20 hours indoors while the town was locked down.</p><p>\"It's nice to be out in the spring air and be relieved,\" Bill Forbush said. \"There's a great sense of relief.\"</p><p>As he spoke police vehicles and officers began to stream out of Franklin Street. Each vehicle and each official was cheered. \"Great job, you guys,\" shouted one man, over and over.</p><p>Tsarnaev had proved to be exceptionally adept in eluding the combined forces of some of the most highly trained and heavily armed law enforcement agencies in America. By the time of his capture, he had managed to evade capture for more than four days.</p><h2>'A guy with full potential'</h2><p>More details emerged on Friday about the background of the brothers, ethnic Chechens who had followed a convoluted path to the United States. Although it appears that they never lived in Chechnya, they maintained close ties to its culture.</p><p>There were conflicting reports about their places of birth. Local media in Kyrgyzstan quoted police saying they had both been born there. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community.</p><p>According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002. He appears to have spent his formative years in the US and graduated from high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2011. The first of two wars in Chechnya broke out in 1994, a year after he was born. The battles with Moscow spawned Islamic radicalism in the state, leading to deadly attacks on the Moscow metro in 2004 and 2010, and a school in Beslan in 2004.</p><p>Checnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer <a href=\"http://johanneshirn.photoshelter.com/\">Johannes Hirn</a>, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010. One caption in the report, which had been removed from Hirn's website by Friday night, read: \"Unless his native Chechnya becomes independent, Tamerlan says he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia.\" </p><p>The photo essay also showed him to have been committed to his Muslim faith, and poorly integrated in the US. According to Hirn's report, the Chechen once said: \"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.\" </p><p>Friends of Dzhokhar Tsaranaev described him as very differnet from his older brother. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, an intern at the Boston Globe, told the paper in a <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/video/?bctid=2312754444001\">video report</a> that they were good friends at Cambridge Rindge Latin high school with Dzokhar. </p><p>He said: \"Dzhokhar was just a guy with full potential, and never showed any signs of doing this whatsoever. I think that if you ask anybody in Cambridge that truly knew him, and truly hung out with him, this you would know that this is probably the most shocking news we've heard in a while ... I can't even comprehend it still.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder\">Miriam Elder</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There was no chance this time that he could escape.</p><p>It is now believed that Tsarnaev may have been holed up in the boat all day, eluding the door-to-door search that was going on elsewhere. Birch Road is just a couple of blocks outside the 20-block exclusion zone that the police had set up early on Friday in an attempt to contain the suspect.</p><p>Amid fears that Tsarnaev may have been wearing a suicide vest or carrying explosives, officers were extremely cautious about moving in. As darkness fell, the barrage of forces ringed around the boat was reinforced by specialist FBI squads dressed in full military gear, wearing protective helmets and vests and equipped with nightvision goggles. Bomb disposal experts, equipped with a robot, were also brought in.</p><p>Police used a helicopter to monitor the boat from overhead, reporting early in the operation that there was visible movement coming from underneath the tarp, suggesting that Tsarnaev was at that point still alive. Minutes before 8pm there were flashes of light and booms thought to be grenades thrown into the boat.</p><p>Around 150 people had gathered at the end of nearby Franklin Street to watch the police operation. Most were neighbours who lived within one or two blocks. Many had waited here for an hour or more after hearing police had the second suspect cornered.</p><p>The first sign that Tsarnaev might have been taken into custody came when a uniformed officer walked away from the top of Franklin Street and vigorously clapped the hand of a fellow official. He looked down at the ground and clapped his hands two or three times.</p><p>The crowd read the signal and broke out into applause, cheering. \"Did you get him?\" one man shouted. An officer nodded his head. The cheers intensified.</p><p>\"It feels great,\" said Bill Forbush, who two blocks away from where Tsarnaev was apprehended. He and his wife, Ann, had been standing on the corner for an hour and a half. They had heard the first gunshots, and heard the sounds of what reportedly were flash bang grenades. They had  spent 20 hours indoors while the town was locked down.</p><p>\"It's nice to be out in the spring air and be relieved,\" Bill Forbush said. \"There's a great sense of relief.\"</p><p>As he spoke police vehicles and officers began to stream out of Franklin Street. Each vehicle and each official was cheered. \"Great job, you guys,\" shouted one man, over and over.</p><p>Tsarnaev had proved to be exceptionally adept in eluding the combined forces of some of the most highly trained and heavily armed law enforcement agencies in America. By the time of his capture, he had managed to evade capture for more than four days.</p><h2>'A guy with full potential'</h2><p>More details emerged on Friday about the background of the brothers, ethnic Chechens who had followed a convoluted path to the United States. Although it appears that they never lived in Chechnya, they maintained close ties to its culture.</p><p>There were conflicting reports about their places of birth. Local media in Kyrgyzstan quoted police saying they had both been born there. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community.</p><p>According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002. He appears to have spent his formative years in the US and graduated from high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2011. The first of two wars in Chechnya broke out in 1994, a year after he was born. The battles with Moscow spawned Islamic radicalism in the state, leading to deadly attacks on the Moscow metro in 2004 and 2010, and a school in Beslan in 2004.</p><p>Checnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer <a href=\"http://johanneshirn.photoshelter.com/\">Johannes Hirn</a>, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010. One caption in the report, which had been removed from Hirn's website by Friday night, read: \"Unless his native Chechnya becomes independent, Tamerlan says he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia.\" </p><p>The photo essay also showed him to have been committed to his Muslim faith, and poorly integrated in the US. According to Hirn's report, the Chechen once said: \"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.\" </p><p>Friends of Dzhokhar Tsaranaev described him as very differnet from his older brother. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, an intern at the Boston Globe, told the paper in a <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/video/?bctid=2312754444001\">video report</a> that they were good friends at Cambridge Rindge Latin high school with Dzokhar. </p><p>He said: \"Dzhokhar was just a guy with full potential, and never showed any signs of doing this whatsoever. I think that if you ask anybody in Cambridge that truly knew him, and truly hung out with him, this you would know that this is probably the most shocking news we've heard in a while ... I can't even comprehend it still.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder\">Miriam Elder</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Some women wept at the end of it, immediately sending it to friends with \"you must watch this\" notes; others have gotten <a href=\"http://jazzylittledrops.tumblr.com/post/48118645174/why-doves-real-beauty-sketches-video-makes-me\">downright angry about it</a>. </p><p>Let's start with the obvious: it's an ad, not a film festival documentary. It's been edited heavily and has overly melodramatic music. And yes, at the end of the day, it's trying to sell something, although it's striking that no Dove products are mentioned during the entire three-minute clip, and the Dove brand itself isn't even flashed on the screen until the final seconds. But all the cheesiness doesn't take away from its powerful message: women are too often their own worst critics.</p><p>The ad follows a<a href=\"http://realbeautysketches.dove.us/\"> forensic artist</a>, one of those people who draws crime suspects based on witnesses' descriptions. In this case, he draws facial portraits of several women based solely on what they tell him. He can't see them. Then he draws pictures of the same women based on what people who have only interacted with them for a short while describe. In almost every case, there's a stark difference between the two images of each woman.</p><p>The self-described portraits are uglier, sadder and almost sour-looking in some instances. When the artist asks an African-American woman what her most prominent feature is, she says, \"I have a fat, rounder face,\" immediately honing in on the negative. Several females bemoan their ageing: crows feet around the eyes, more freckles. You can only imagine what they would have said if the portraits were full-body. </p><p>This isn't novel. Plenty of studies have concluded that women tend to view themselves as worse-looking than they are. In an oft-cited 2003 research project, young women were asked to pick out their body image from a range of figures. On average, they picked figures that were <a href=\"http://www.lifeclinic.com/fullpage.aspx?prid=514285&type=1\">11lb (5kg) heavier than their actual weight</a> (young men, by contrast, picked out a figure that was \"better\" than reality). </p><p>Most of us don't need formal studies to know this. Just think about the last few times you've complimented a female on her appearance. More often than not, you get something back along the lines of \"Oh, this old dress/shirt/purse?\" or \"Thanks, but …\" or \"My hairdresser/friend helped me.\" We are constantly diminishing ourselves or attributing our good aspects to the influence of someone or something else.</p><p>Appearances shouldn't matter so much, but they do. One of the loudest criticisms about the Dove ad has been the line where one woman says: </p><blockquote><p>\"I should be more grateful of my natural beauty. It impacts the choices and friends that we make, the jobs we apply for, how we treat our children. It impacts everything. It couldn't be more central to your happiness.\"</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.rawrach.com/2013/04/raw-adjective-7-brutally-or-grossly_17.html\">Blogger Raw Rach just can't seem to understand</a> why some women are unable to say \"f that\" to societal pressure and move on: \"I wanna grab onto their shoulders and shake them and say: get over it already. Chuck the fear.\" It's a noble sentiment, but we do live in visual world, one that is only further enhanced by social media and our camera phones. </p><p>Jean Kilbourne, an author, critic and creator of the <a href=\"http://www.jeankilbourne.com/videos/\">Killing Us Softly film series</a> has studied images of women in the media and pop culture for decades. She says:</p><blockquote><p>\"I think hands down the biggest challenge for young women today is trying to have a healthy self image in a toxic cultural environment.… Dove is owned by Unilever, and some of the products being sold are really stupid like cellulite firming cream. Even so, I still think there's such a paucity of images out there that in any way break away, raise issues or present women in a different way, even if you aren't perfect.\"</p></blockquote><p>Attacking the Dove ad as part of this \"toxic\" environment sends the wrong message. If we want to point fingers, let's start with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ZLjWkYmr8\">GoDaddy Super Bowl ad</a>, just about any fragrance ad featuring heavily photoshopped models in sexually suggestive photos or<a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/ready-for-love/\"> TV series like Ready for Love</a> that have women declare their undying affection for men they haven't even met.</p><p>Dove's underlying message is you are more beautiful than you think. Be more confident. Frankly, it's refreshing to see an ad that tackles a genuine societal problem head-on, let alone marketing that doesn't try to turn women into sex objects, overburdened housewives or shopaholics.</p><p>Critics of the Dove ad who argue that it holds up white features as ideal make a valid point. Even when the \"strangers\" describe the women, they often use terms like smaller chins and bluer eyes as compliments. Dove should take this to heart in their next go-around. But the point remains: women, whatever their skin tone, should be happier with themselves. </p><p>It's been a hard couple of months, if not couple of years, for women. If we aren't getting told our physical appearance is lacking by the media and advertising, we're getting a lecture from some high-profile figure or another about how we aren't living up to our career potential or finding that elusive \"balance\" in our life. We always lack something, and advertisers can't wait to inform us that one product will make all the difference.</p><p>We know that marketing is false. Yet we are too quick to blame our own shortcomings, as if we were the only ones out there who don't fit the superwoman, supermodel mold. </p><p>Dove put a crack in that veneer. That's the reason the ad has been shared widely. That's the reason some cried right along with the participant who <a href=\"http://realbeautysketches.dove.us/\">admitted she's got a lot of work to do</a> on her self-confidence. Writing those views off as weak or unfeminist, as some have done, is counterproductive.</p><p>Instead of picking the ad apart, applaud it for what it is – and ask for an even better encore.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/advertising\">Advertising</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/beauty\">Beauty</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/unilever\">Unilever</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gender\">Gender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feminism\">Feminism</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heather-long\">Heather Long</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chuck the fear.\" It's a noble sentiment, but we do live in visual world, one that is only further enhanced by social media and our camera phones. </p><p>Jean Kilbourne, an author, critic and creator of the <a href=\"http://www.jeankilbourne.com/videos/\">Killing Us Softly film series</a> has studied images of women in the media and pop culture for decades. She says:</p><blockquote><p>\"I think hands down the biggest challenge for young women today is trying to have a healthy self image in a toxic cultural environment.… Dove is owned by Unilever, and some of the products being sold are really stupid like cellulite firming cream. Even so, I still think there's such a paucity of images out there that in any way break away, raise issues or present women in a different way, even if you aren't perfect.\"</p></blockquote><p>Attacking the Dove ad as part of this \"toxic\" environment sends the wrong message. If we want to point fingers, let's start with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7ZLjWkYmr8\">GoDaddy Super Bowl ad</a>, just about any fragrance ad featuring heavily photoshopped models in sexually suggestive photos or<a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/ready-for-love/\"> TV series like Ready for Love</a> that have women declare their undying affection for men they haven't even met.</p><p>Dove's underlying message is you are more beautiful than you think. Be more confident. Frankly, it's refreshing to see an ad that tackles a genuine societal problem head-on, let alone marketing that doesn't try to turn women into sex objects, overburdened housewives or shopaholics.</p><p>Critics of the Dove ad who argue that it holds up white features as ideal make a valid point. Even when the \"strangers\" describe the women, they often use terms like smaller chins and bluer eyes as compliments. Dove should take this to heart in their next go-around. But the point remains: women, whatever their skin tone, should be happier with themselves. </p><p>It's been a hard couple of months, if not couple of years, for women. If we aren't getting told our physical appearance is lacking by the media and advertising, we're getting a lecture from some high-profile figure or another about how we aren't living up to our career potential or finding that elusive \"balance\" in our life. We always lack something, and advertisers can't wait to inform us that one product will make all the difference.</p><p>We know that marketing is false. Yet we are too quick to blame our own shortcomings, as if we were the only ones out there who don't fit the superwoman, supermodel mold. </p><p>Dove put a crack in that veneer. That's the reason the ad has been shared widely. That's the reason some cried right along with the participant who <a href=\"http://realbeautysketches.dove.us/\">admitted she's got a lot of work to do</a> on her self-confidence. Writing those views off as weak or unfeminist, as some have done, is counterproductive.</p><p>Instead of picking the ad apart, applaud it for what it is – and ask for an even better encore.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/advertising\">Advertising</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/beauty\">Beauty</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/unilever\">Unilever</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gender\">Gender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feminism\">Feminism</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heather-long\">Heather Long</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And with greater legislative freedoms, we have an opportunity to take a broader view of gay politics, and redefine what we mean by gay culture.</p><p>It was with this in mind that Guardian writer Julie Bindel and I decided to launch a new online magazine called <a href=\"http://www.gaze-amodernreview.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gaze – A Modern Review</a>. We didn't want to write about gay lifestyle or pander to straight soap hunks who love their gay fans. We wanted to tackle issues one doesn't generally read about in the lesbian and gay press. For too long, gay people were defined by the expectations of heterosexuals – and we ended up in a ghetto, with a narrow view of the world beyond. Now the legal battles are mostly won, isn't it time we reclaimed all of culture – not just the \"gay\" bits – for ourselves?</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights\">Gay rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality\">Sexuality</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps\">Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paul-burston\">Paul Burston</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Luckily, he said, he had brought a few pairs of skis with him so was able to present his project to the local authorities, who finally gave him the green light that year.</p><p></p><p>The initiative would not have been possible without the help of Falah Salah, a Kurdistan Regional Government official and member of the Tigris Association. \"Our long-term goal is to import the successful 'white week' model into Kurdistan,\" Salah told IPS, referring to the annual 14-week period when over 5,000 schoolchildren from northern Spain's Navarra region converge for skiing trips in the Pyrenees mountain range that forms the natural border between France and Spain.</p><p></p><p>Over the past 30 years, this programme has become such an integral part of the economy of Spain's Roncal valley that many fear it will not be able to sustain itself without the ski industry. Innkeepers in the region told IPS that they earn 70% of their annual income during the winter months.</p><p></p><p>Salah believes the economically depressed Iraqi border region, where cattle rearing and farming have traditionally been the primary means of subsistence, could benefit greatly by promoting a similar scheme.</p><p></p><p>Skiers demand equipment rentals, they eat kebabs at local restaurants and eventually spend the weekend in a village that has hitherto only served as a transit spot for refugees fleeing from either side of the Iran-Iraq border.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to cultivate a love of snow and winter sports among the local population here. Having grown up in the rocky mountains that are covered for several months of the year in a thick white blanket, Kurds of almost all ages have been quick to participate in this playful activity, which Urizar labels \"sustainable skiing\".</p><p></p><p>No ski lifts or other metallic eyesores ruin the beautiful landscape here. Instead, a simple municipal building, located close to a ski site, houses the equipment. Just outside, an unobtrusive track guides cross-country skiers through the shrubbery.</p><p></p><p>Dlosh Fatah, a physical education teacher at a school in the neighbouring Rania district, 330km north-east of Baghdad, won a pair of skis in Penjwin in 2012 and said the experience was so satisfying that she came back as an instructor a year later with a group who had received training in the Pyrenees during the first week of April.</p><p></p><p>Though her technique could do with some improvement, \"for the time being, it's more important to convey what I have learned to our children here\", the 25-year-old told IPS, and proudly produced a diploma issued by the ski school of the Roncal valley.</p><p></p><p>Chia Hassan is another future Kurdish ski instructor to whom Urizar will probably pass the baton in the winter of 2014. \"During our visit to the Pyrenees we have seen the development cross-country skiing brought to a mountainous region similar to ours,\" Hassan told IPS. \"Like us, [locals] were living on wood and cattle until they discovered that snow could also be economically profitable,\" the 31-year-old Kurd from Rania told IPS.</p><p></p><p>Penjwin's ski centre got a boost this year when local TV channels and newspapers picked up the story.

Luckily, he said, he had brought a few pairs of skis with him so was able to present his project to the local authorities, who finally gave him the green light that year.</p><p></p><p>The initiative would not have been possible without the help of Falah Salah, a Kurdistan Regional Government official and member of the Tigris Association. \"Our long-term goal is to import the successful 'white week' model into Kurdistan,\" Salah told IPS, referring to the annual 14-week period when over 5,000 schoolchildren from northern Spain's Navarra region converge for skiing trips in the Pyrenees mountain range that forms the natural border between France and Spain.</p><p></p><p>Over the past 30 years, this programme has become such an integral part of the economy of Spain's Roncal valley that many fear it will not be able to sustain itself without the ski industry. Innkeepers in the region told IPS that they earn 70% of their annual income during the winter months.</p><p></p><p>Salah believes the economically depressed Iraqi border region, where cattle rearing and farming have traditionally been the primary means of subsistence, could benefit greatly by promoting a similar scheme.</p><p></p><p>Skiers demand equipment rentals, they eat kebabs at local restaurants and eventually spend the weekend in a village that has hitherto only served as a transit spot for refugees fleeing from either side of the Iran-Iraq border.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to cultivate a love of snow and winter sports among the local population here. Having grown up in the rocky mountains that are covered for several months of the year in a thick white blanket, Kurds of almost all ages have been quick to participate in this playful activity, which Urizar labels \"sustainable skiing\".</p><p></p><p>No ski lifts or other metallic eyesores ruin the beautiful landscape here. Instead, a simple municipal building, located close to a ski site, houses the equipment. Just outside, an unobtrusive track guides cross-country skiers through the shrubbery.</p><p></p><p>Dlosh Fatah, a physical education teacher at a school in the neighbouring Rania district, 330km north-east of Baghdad, won a pair of skis in Penjwin in 2012 and said the experience was so satisfying that she came back as an instructor a year later with a group who had received training in the Pyrenees during the first week of April.</p><p></p><p>Though her technique could do with some improvement, \"for the time being, it's more important to convey what I have learned to our children here\", the 25-year-old told IPS, and proudly produced a diploma issued by the ski school of the Roncal valley.</p><p></p><p>Chia Hassan is another future Kurdish ski instructor to whom Urizar will probably pass the baton in the winter of 2014. \"During our visit to the Pyrenees we have seen the development cross-country skiing brought to a mountainous region similar to ours,\" Hassan told IPS. \"Like us, [locals] were living on wood and cattle until they discovered that snow could also be economically profitable,\" the 31-year-old Kurd from Rania told IPS.</p><p></p><p>Penjwin's ski centre got a boost this year when local TV channels and newspapers picked up the story. The news has piqued curiosity on the other side of the border, including an invitation from the Iranian Kurdish town of Sardasht, 430km west of Tehran, to share details of the project.</p><p></p><p>\"We will definitely visit our friends in Sardasht but we must also struggle to take the project to other valleys in Iraqi Kurdistan,\" Urizar said. He believes the best skiing spot is in the Qandil mountains, an imposing watchtower peering down from a height of 3,000 metres, located at the spot where the borders of Turkey, Iraq and Iran meet.</p><p></p><p>\"If negotiations between Ankara and the Kurds of Turkey stay on track we might be able be able to ski there one day,\" Salah said, hopefully.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, the mountain range remains a stronghold of the Kurdistan Workers Party, a guerrilla group engaged in an armed struggle for rights and recognition.

James Wood, Iain Sinclair, Robert Macfarlane and Will Self reflect on what his work means to them</p><h2>James Wood</h2><p>When I first read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/dec/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation\" title=\"\">WG Sebald's great work, <em>The Emigrants</em></a>, I kept forgetting whether the book was originally written in German or English. Sebald wrote in German, but lived most of his life in Britain, and it was clear that he worked over the English so that it amounted almost to a collaboration with his translator. Sebald's prose belongs, mysteriously, nowhere. The enigmatic patience of the sentences, the pedantic syntax, the peculiar antiquity of the diction, the strange recessed distance of the writing, in which everything seems milky and sub-aqueous, just beyond reach – all&nbsp;of&nbsp;this gives Sebald his particular flavour, so that sometimes it seems that we are reading not a particular writer but an emanation of literature.</p><p>There's an undeniably bookish quality to Sebald's writing; despite his originality, some of his effects come from other writers. He takes his 19th-century Gothic diction from the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/rock-crystal/\" title=\"\">Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter</a>, and a fair amount of his obsessive extremism from the <a href=\"http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?GCOI=15647100273550&fa=customcontent&extrasfile=A12622B2-B0D0-B086-B6697FF0A86CB444.html\" title=\"\">Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard</a>. (Sebald mutes Bernhard's suicidal clamour.) The effect is strange – Sebald seems both real and artificial, both alive and dead. In the essay published here, for instance, the author seems to be telling us directly about the time he spent on the island of Saint-Pierre. Yet the self-conscious pedantry – \"during which time I passed not a few hours sitting by the window\"; \"an island with a circumference of some two miles\" – makes the author a&nbsp;little distant, and we begin to wonder if the essay is a true account or a literary concoction spun in the study. As Sebald unfolds the story of Rousseau's tribulations (\"a&nbsp;dozen years filled with fear and panic\"), the essay seems, in its&nbsp;placeless antiquity, like one of Rousseau's own <em>Reveries of a Solitary Walker</em>, and suddenly it's not Rousseau's obsessive inability to stop thinking that is the theme, but Sebald's own obsessive inability (\"the thoughts constantly brewing in his head like storm clouds\"). In this way – and also, of course, through his use of photographs – Sebald was always asking us to reflect on how we access the past, how we rescue the dead, and how the writer performs that real, but necessarily fictional, reclamation.</p><p></p><h2>Iain Sinclair</h2><p>I only set eyes on Max Sebald one time.&nbsp;We shared a descending lift in Broadcasting House, pressed back into our safe corners, silent. He impersonated what I took him to be – writer, walker, culturally burdened European – so beautifully that I wondered if this was an actor, a hireling. I had been reading in one of the broadsheets that morning how Sebald had agreed to give only one interview to publicise his latest project. Now the PR minder sent along by his publisher was running through the programme of the day's events: more radio, coffee conversations, lunch interrogations, readings.</p><p>One of the elements that drew me to&nbsp;Sebald was his interest, so elegantly glancing and oblique, in Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau, with his <em>Confessions</em>, his furious pedestrian surges across Paris, his long tramps out in the territory, arguing with memory, fixing the sins of the past, provided the quotation with which I launched my first book in 1970. \"My thoughts were calm and peaceful; they were not heavenly or ecstatic. Objects caught my eye. I observed the different landscapes I passed through, I noticed the trees, the houses, and the streams. I&nbsp;deliberated at crossroads. I was afraid of getting lost, but did not lose myself even once. In a word, I was no longer in the clouds. Sometimes I was where I&nbsp;was, sometimes already at my destination, but never did I soar off into the distance.\"</p><p>From the start then, Rousseau catches the elusive essence of Sebaldian dogma: which is to be both elusive and precise, documentary and fabulous. Under the gravity of that silvered moustache, he was more English than the English, more alien.</p><h2>Robert Macfarlane</h2><p>In the too-short course of his writing life, WG Sebald remade the novel, and as he did so he also remade the travelogue. Walter Benjamin's observation that all great writers either create a new form or destroy an old one was only part-right in the case of Sebald, for he created multiple new forms. Certainly, almost no one seriously addressing the subjects of place and memory – whether in fiction, film, photography or academia – now does so from beyond Sebald's shadow (his writerly camp followers are legion, immediately identifiable by their melancholy lucubrations, the black-and-white photographs that stud their paragraphs, their flourished fetishes for skulls and for silk …). His four great \"prose fictions\" (<a href=\"http://sebald.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Vertigo</em></a>, <em>The Emigrants</em>, <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>, <em>Austerlitz</em>), might appear regressive in their prolonged sentences, and their nested narrative structures, but really they opened fresh possibilities for the novel, especially in its engagements with trauma and atrocity. Sebald's seemingly passive prose was in fact – to borrow Marianne Moore's memorable phrase – \"diction galvanised against inertia\". I&nbsp;still remember reading <em>The Rings of Saturn</em> for the first time. It was – the dimming of light, the increase of pressure – like diving far down through historical water. The after-effects were with me for a long time; are with me still. Late in his life, Sebald wrote a&nbsp;short but fascinating essay on the work of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/bruce-chatwin\" title=\"\">Bruce Chatwin</a>. \"Just as Chatwin himself ultimately remains an enigma,\" Sebald remarked.</p><p>One never knows how to classify his&nbsp;books. All that is obvious is that their structure and intentions place them in no known genre. Inspired by a&nbsp;kind of avidity for the undiscovered, they move along a line where the points of demarcation are those strange manifestations and objects of which one cannot say whether they are among the phantasms generated in our minds from time immemorial.</p><p>Sebald could have been writing about his own astonishing and enigmatic books: haunted by phantasms who might be archetypes, polymorphous in their form, piebald in their appearance, travelling widely in time if not broadly in space, and inspired by an avidity for the undiscovered.</p><p></p><h2>Will Self</h2><p>WG Sebald, who died in a car crash in 2001, was an inspired essayist, quite as&nbsp;much as he was a novelist; indeed, I&nbsp;often think of his most achieved fictions – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/sep/30/travel.highereducation\" title=\"\"><em>Austerlitz</em></a>, and <em>The Emigrants </em>– as writing that tests the limits of both&nbsp;forms, blending them together at&nbsp;their margins with a kind of vaporous diffusion of their creator's lucidity, so entirely are the invented and the real fused together. This essay on the last years of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's life exhibits all of Sebald's strengths as a writer – and all of his strange, gnomic, secretive foibles. Ostensibly a straightforward account of Rousseau's exiled wanderings, it begins with his first glimpse, in 1965, of&nbsp;the Ile Saint Pierre in Switzerland, where Rousseau spent the first period of his stateless exile, and where he claimed – in his <em>Reveries of a Solitary Walker</em> – that he was happier than he had been anywhere else.</p><p>Sebald goes on to recount his own eventual landfall on the island in 1996, then employs this – the parenthetic of his own life – to consider the strange denouement and afterlife of the pre-eminent ideologue of the French revolution. It is a technique we&nbsp;are familiar with in Sebald's fiction: the author is very much present in these lines, and yet simultaneously absent. This is in keeping with Sebald's themes&nbsp;of exile and misappropriation, because, while he&nbsp;may be writing about&nbsp;another speculative thinker who&nbsp;lived 200 years before, as ever he&nbsp;is attempting to discover the hidden&nbsp;connections that bind human thought both to itself, and to the wider&nbsp;world.</p><p>Of course, what occurred between 1965 and 1996 for Sebald was his own exile: it was following the revelations of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials in the&nbsp;summer of the year that Sebald visited the island (trials he witnessed firsthand, and which revealed to him the extent of his parents' generation's complicity in the Holocaust), and it was following this visit that the young academic took steps that led to his eventual domicile on another island, Britain, where he spent the next three decades at the University of East Anglia. Sebald allows this to lie beneath the text – a discoverable and&nbsp;psychic subtext; and just as he neglects to inform us of why Rousseau's paranoid and haunted final years should have had such a resonance for him, so this compulsively peripatetic and ambulatory writer also leaves off the list of distinguished writerly pilgrims to Rousseau's happy isle the greatest British walker-writer of them all, Worsdworth, who tramped all the way there in 1788, en route to his own liaison with revolutionary apotheosis.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/wgsebald\">WG Sebald</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/biography\">Biography</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/essays\">Essays</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/switzerland\">Switzerland</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jameswood\">James Wood</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iainsinclair\">Iain Sinclair</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/will-self\">Will Self</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was a hazy sort of day, and I remember how, on reaching the edge of the small wood covering the slope, I paused to look back down at the path I had come by, at the plain stretching away to the north crisscrossed by the straight lines of canals, with the hills shrouded in mist beyond; and how, when I emerged once more into the fields above the village of Lüscherz, I saw spread out below me the Lac de Bienne, and sat there for an hour or more lost in thought at the sight, resolving that at the earliest opportunity I would cross over to the island in the lake which, on that autumn day, was flooded with a trembling pale light. As so often happens in life, however, it took another 31 years before this plan could be realised and I was finally able, in the early summer of 1996, in the company of an exceedingly obliging host who lived high above the steep shores of the lake and who habitually wore a kind of captain's cap, smoked Indian <em>bidis</em> and seldom spoke, to make the journey across the lake from the city of Bienne to the island of Saint-Pierre, formed during the last ice age by the retreating Rhône glacier into the shape of a whale's back – or so it is generally said. The ship which took us along the edge of the Jura massif where it plunges steeply into the lake was called the Ville de Fribourg. Among the other passengers on board were the gaudily attired members of a male voice choir, who several times during the short crossing struck up from the stern a chorus of \"<em>Làhaut sur la montagne</em>,<em> Les&nbsp;jours s'en vont</em>\" or another such Swiss refrain, with the sole intention, or so it seemed to me, of reminding me, with the curiously strained, guttural notes their ensemble produced, of how far I&nbsp;had come meanwhile from my place of origin.</p><p>Apart from a single farmstead, there is now only one dwelling on the Île Saint Pierre – an island with a circumference of some two miles – and that is a former Cluniac monastery which now houses a hotel and restaurant run by Blausee AG. After walking there from the landing stage, I&nbsp;sat for a while drinking coffee with my companion in the shady trellised courtyard, until it was time for him to take his leave and I&nbsp;watched from the gate as he made his way slowly down the white path, just like a sailor who, I&nbsp;thought to myself, after years of sailing the high seas finds himself washed up on the unfamiliar mainland once more. The room I took at the hotel looked out on the south side of the building, directly adjacent to the two rooms which Jean-Jacques Rousseau occupied when, in September 1765, exactly 200 years before my first sight of the island from the top of the Schattenrain, he found refuge here, at least until the Berne <em>Petit Conseil</em> drove him out from even this last outpost of his native land. \"By Saturday next,\" as&nbsp;an edict sent to the <em>bailli</em> [king's representative] in Nidau stated, \"the said M Rousseau is to remove himself from your Excellencies' territories and shall not be permitted to return save under pain of the severest penalty.\" In&nbsp;the decades after Rousseau's death, when his fame had spread throughout Europe and beyond, an endless procession of illustrious personages visited the island to see for themselves the place in which the philosopher, novelist, autobiographer and inventor of the bourgeois cult of romantic sensibility was for a brief period – as he claims in the Fifth Promenade in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/15/reveries-solitary-walker-rousseau-review\" title=\"\"><em>Reveries of the Solitary Walker</em></a> – happier than in any other place. The adventurer and confidence trickster Cagliostro, the &nbsp;French conseiller du Parlement Desjobert, the English statesman Thomas Pitt, diverse kings of Prussia, Sweden and Bavaria all came to the island, not least among them the former Empress Joséphine.</p><p>In the course of our own century, now nearing its end, this Rousseau mania has gradually abated. At any rate, in the few days I&nbsp;spent on the island – during which time I passed not a few hours sitting by&nbsp;the window in the Rousseau room – among the tourists who come over to the island on a day trip for a stroll or a&nbsp;bite to eat, only two strayed into this&nbsp;room with its sparse furnishings – a&nbsp;settee, a bed, a table and a chair – and&nbsp;even those two, evidently disappointed at how little there was to&nbsp;see, soon left again. Not one of them bent down to look at the glass display case to try to decipher Rousseau's handwriting, nor noticed the way that the bleached deal floorboards, almost two feet wide, are so worn down in the middle of the room as to form a shallow depression, nor that in places the knots in the wood protrude by almost an inch. No one ran a hand over the stone basin worn smooth by age in the antechamber, or noticed the smell of soot which still lingers in the fireplace, nor paused to look out of the window with its view across the orchard and a meadow to the island's southern shore. For me, though, as I sat in Rousseau's room, it was as if I had been transported back to an earlier age, an illusion I&nbsp;could indulge in all the more readily inasmuch as the island still retained that same quality of silence, undisturbed by even the most distant sound of a motor vehicle, as was still to be found everywhere in the world a&nbsp;century or two ago. Towards evening, especially, when the daytrippers had returned home, the island was immersed in a stillness such as is scarcely now to be found anywhere in the orbit of our civilised world, and where nothing moved, save perhaps the leaves of the mighty poplars in the breezes which sometimes stirred along&nbsp;the edge of the lake. The paths strewn with a fine limestone gravel grew ever brighter as I walked along them in the gathering dusk, past fenced-in meadows, past a pale motionless field of oats, a vineyard, and a vintner's hut, up to the terrace at&nbsp;the edge of the beech wood already black with night, from where I watched the lights go on one after another on the opposite shore.</p><p>When Rousseau fled to the Île Saint-Pierre in the autumn of 1765, he was already on the verge of utter physical and mental exhaustion. Between 1751 and 1761, in his fifth decade and in ever more precarious health, he had, first in Paris and then in&nbsp;the Ermitage at Montmorency, committed to paper thousands upon thousands of pages. <em>The Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts</em>, which earned him the prize of the Académie de Dijon, the treatise <em>On the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men</em>, the opera <em>Le&nbsp;Devin du village</em>, the letters on French music and on Providence, to Voltaire and to D'Alembert, the fairytale <em>La&nbsp;Reine fantasque</em>, the novel <em>La Nouvelle Héloïse</em>; <em>Émile</em>, and <em>The Social Contract</em> – all this and more was written during this period alongside the extremely copious correspondence which Rousseau always maintained. When one considers the extent and diversity of this creative output, one can only assume that Rousseau must have spent the entire time hunched over his desk in an attempt to capture, in endless sequences of lines and letters, the thoughts and feelings incessantly welling up within him. Scarcely had he&nbsp;reached the apogee of literary fame for his passionate epistolatory novel proclaiming the natural rights of lovers, than the state of nervous exhaustion resulting from this manic productivity was further exacerbated when<em> Émile</em> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/rousseau-shows-us-way-break-chains\" title=\"\"><em>The Social Contract</em></a> were banned and confiscated by the <em>parlement</em> in Paris, thus making of the celebrated author an outcast, ostracised and banished from France on pain of arrest. Nor does Rousseau fare any better in his native city of Geneva. Here too he is condemned as a godless and seditious person, and his writings consigned to the flames. Looking back on this time when fate turned against him, Rousseau writes in 1770, at the beginning of the last book of his <em>Confessions</em>: \"Here commences the work of darkness, in which, for eight years past, I have been entombed, without ever having been able, in spite of all my efforts, to penetrate its frightful obscurity. In the abyss of misfortune in which I am submerged, I feel the … blows which are directed against me. I perceive their immediate instrument, but I cannot see either the hand which guides them or the means which it employs. Shame and misfortune fall upon me as if of themselves, and unawares.\" Compared with these dark days, the Île Saint-Pierre must truly have appeared to Rousseau, when he arrived there on 9&nbsp;September, as a paradise in miniature in which he might believe he could collect himself in a stillness, as he writes at the beginning of the \"Fifth Walk\", interrupted only by the cry of the eagle, the song of an occasional bird, and the rushing of the mountain streams. During his stay on the island Rousseau was provided for by the steward Gabriel Engel and his wife Salome, who managed the farmstead with a few servants, and were later reprimanded by the Berne council for having unquestioningly taken in the refugee without further ado. Nonetheless, Rousseau was hardly as solitary on the island in September and October 1765 as the \"Fifth Walk\" would have us believe. As in Môtiers, here too he was subject to the attentions of a steady stream of visitors, from whom he frequently found himself obliged to escape via the trapdoor which is still to be seen in his room to this day.</p><p>Although Rousseau was by no means idle as an author in the few weeks he spent on the Île Saint-Pierre, in retrospect he nonetheless came to see this time as an attempt to free himself from the exigencies of literary production. He talks of how he longs now for something other than literary renown, the scent of which, as he says, revolted him from the very moment he first got a whiff of it. The <em>dégoût</em> Rousseau now felt with regard to literature was not merely an intermittent emotional reaction but something that for him always went hand in hand with the act of writing. In accordance with his doctrine of the formerly unspoiled state of nature, he saw the man who reflects as a depraved animal perverted from its natural state, and reflection as a degraded form of mental energy. No one, in the era when the bourgeoisie was proclaiming, with enormous philosophical and literary effort, its entitlement to emancipation, recognised the pathological aspect of thought as acutely as Rousseau, who himself wished for nothing more than to be able to halt the wheels ceaselessly turning within his head. If he nevertheless persevered with writing, then only, as Jean Starobinski notes, in order to hasten the moment when the pen would fall from his hand and the essential things would be said in the <em>silent</em> embrace of reconciliation and return. Less heroically, but certainly no less correctly, one could also see writing as a continually self-perpetuating compulsive act, evidence that, of all individuals afflicted by the disease of thought, the writer is perhaps the most incurable. The copying out of musical notation, which Rousseau was constrained to undertake in his earlier years and at the last in Paris, was for him one of the few means of keeping at bay the thoughts constantly brewing in his head like storm clouds. How difficult it is in general to bring the machinery of thought to a standstill is shown by Rousseau's description of his apparently so happy days on the island in the Lac&nbsp;de Bienne. He has, as he writes in the \"Fifth Walk\", deliberately forsworn the burden of work, and his greatest joy has been to leave his books safely shut away and to have neither ink nor paper to hand. However, since the leisure time thus freed up must be put to some use, Rousseau devotes himself to the study of botany, whose basic principles he had acquired in Môtiers on excursions with Jean Antoine d'Ivernois. \"I set out to compose,\" writes Rousseau in the \"Fifth Walk\", \"a&nbsp;Flora Petrinsularis and to describe every single plant on the island in enough detail to keep me busy for the rest of my days. They say a German once wrote a book about a lemon peel; I could have written one about every grass in the meadows, every moss in the woods, every lichen covering the rocks – and I did not want to leave even one blade of grass or atom of vegetation without a full and detailed description. In accordance with this noble plan, every morning after breakfast I would set out with a magnifying glass in my hand and my <em>Systema Naturae</em> under my arm to study one particular section of the island, which I had divided for this purpose into small squares, intending to visit them all one after another in every season.\" The central motif of this passage is not so much the impartial insight into the indigenous plants of the island as that of ordering, classification and the creation of a perfect system. Thus this apparently innocent occupation – the deliberate resolve no longer to think and merely to look at nature – becomes, for the writer plagued by the chronic need to think and work, a demanding rationalistic project involving the compiling of lists, indices and catalogues, along with the precise description of, for example, the long stamens of self-heal, the springiness of those of nettle and of wall-pellitory, and the sudden bursting of the seed capsules of balsam and of beech. None the less, the leaves of the small <em>herbaria</em> which Rousseau later compiled for Madelon and Julie de la Tour and other young ladies take on the aspect of an innocent bricolage in comparison with the self-destructive business of writing to which he usually submitted himself. A faint aura of unconscious beauty still hovers over these flower collections, in which lichens, sprigs of veronica, lilies-of-the-valley and autumn crocuses have survived, pressed and a little faded, from the 18th century. They can still be admired today in the Musée Carnavalet and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. The&nbsp;herbarium Rousseau compiled for himself, meanwhile – 11 quarto volumes – was, up to the second world war, preserved in the Botanical Museum in Berlin, until, like so much and so many in that city, it went up in flames one night during one of the nocturnal bombing raids.</p><p>A dozen years filled with fear and panic await Rousseau after his departure from the Île Saint-Pierre on 25 October. For three years after his return to France in 1767, Rousseau lives&nbsp;with Thérèse La Vasseur – his housekeeper of 20 years and the mother of his five long-lost children – in remote country seats of the nobility such as Château Trye in Normandy, or in small towns like Bourgoin or Monquin far away in the South, always with the shadow of outlawry hanging over him. When, in 1770, on condition of not publishing anything on political or religious questions, he receives permission to reside in the capital, attempting to eke out a living there by copying out sheet music, the morbid universe surrounding him can no longer be dispelled. \"The children's grimaces,\" Starobinski writes, \"the price of peas in Les Halles, the small shops in the rue Plâtrière – all appeared to be evidence of the same conspiracy.\" This notwithstanding, Rousseau does still succeed in accomplishing a considerable amount. He finishes the <em>Confessions</em> and reads from them in various salons in sessions lasting up to 17 (!) hours, to some extent anticipating <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/franzkafka\" title=\"\">Franz Kafka</a>'s desire to be allowed to read aloud, to an audience condemned to listen, the whole of Stendhal's <em>Éducation sentimentale</em> at one sitting. There follow a few more treatises, on botany and on the government of Poland, as well as the so-called <em>Dialogues</em>, in which Rousseau appears as the judge of Jean-Jacques. In his last two years while out walking he makes notes, on playing cards, for the <em>Rêveries d'un promeneur solitaire</em>, which he completes in April 1780. After&nbsp;that he leaves Paris and moves into a small house in the park at Ermenonville which the Marquis de Girardin has placed at his disposal. He&nbsp;lives there for five more weeks in early summer. He rises at dawn, goes for walks, leaning on his cane, in the beautiful surroundings, collects leaves and flowers and sometimes takes a&nbsp;boat out on to the lake. On 2 July – he&nbsp;is 66 years old – he&nbsp;comes back from one of his walks with a terrible headache. Thérèse helps him into a&nbsp;chair. Felled by a stroke, he collapses on to the floor and, after a few convulsions, dies. Two days later he is buried at Ermenonville on the Isle of Poplars. In&nbsp;the years which follow, the Marquis transforms his estate into a <em>parc du souvenir</em>. He has a classical monument erected, the Swiss chalet is completed, a Temple of Philosophy is constructed with an altar dedicated to reverie. Even the cabin in front of which Rousseau would often sit on a bench, gazing out over the peaceful landscape, is carefully preserved. The park has become a site of pilgrimage, and more than one lady sinks down before the grave on the island, pressing her bosom against the cold stone beneath which Rousseau's earthly remains rest, until, that is, on 9&nbsp;October 1794 they are transferred to the Panthéon. On this memorable day, a group of musicians performed excerpts from the opera <em>Le Devin du village</em>; the oak coffin, triple-lined with lead and further clad with an outer lead covering, was raised from the earth and taken to Paris in a grand and solemn cortège. In all the villages along the route the people lined the streets calling, \"Vive la République! Vive la mémoire de Jean-Jacques Rousseau!\" On the evening of 10 October the procession arrived at the Tuileries, where a huge crowd was waiting with flaming torches. The coffin, covered by&nbsp;a wooden framework painted with the symbols of the revolution, was placed on a bier surrounded by a semicircle of willows. The main part of the ceremony took place the following morning, when the funeral procession continued on its way to the Panthéon, led by a captain of the United States navy bearing the banner of the stars and stripes, and followed by two standard bearers carrying the tricolore and the colours of the Republic of Geneva.</p><p>• Translated by Jo Catling.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/biography\">Biography</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/essays\">Essays</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/wgsebald\">WG Sebald</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/switzerland\">Switzerland</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The copying out of musical notation, which Rousseau was constrained to undertake in his earlier years and at the last in Paris, was for him one of the few means of keeping at bay the thoughts constantly brewing in his head like storm clouds. How difficult it is in general to bring the machinery of thought to a standstill is shown by Rousseau's description of his apparently so happy days on the island in the Lac&nbsp;de Bienne. He has, as he writes in the \"Fifth Walk\", deliberately forsworn the burden of work, and his greatest joy has been to leave his books safely shut away and to have neither ink nor paper to hand. However, since the leisure time thus freed up must be put to some use, Rousseau devotes himself to the study of botany, whose basic principles he had acquired in Môtiers on excursions with Jean Antoine d'Ivernois. \"I set out to compose,\" writes Rousseau in the \"Fifth Walk\", \"a&nbsp;Flora Petrinsularis and to describe every single plant on the island in enough detail to keep me busy for the rest of my days. They say a German once wrote a book about a lemon peel; I could have written one about every grass in the meadows, every moss in the woods, every lichen covering the rocks – and I did not want to leave even one blade of grass or atom of vegetation without a full and detailed description. In accordance with this noble plan, every morning after breakfast I would set out with a magnifying glass in my hand and my <em>Systema Naturae</em> under my arm to study one particular section of the island, which I had divided for this purpose into small squares, intending to visit them all one after another in every season.\" The central motif of this passage is not so much the impartial insight into the indigenous plants of the island as that of ordering, classification and the creation of a perfect system. Thus this apparently innocent occupation – the deliberate resolve no longer to think and merely to look at nature – becomes, for the writer plagued by the chronic need to think and work, a demanding rationalistic project involving the compiling of lists, indices and catalogues, along with the precise description of, for example, the long stamens of self-heal, the springiness of those of nettle and of wall-pellitory, and the sudden bursting of the seed capsules of balsam and of beech. None the less, the leaves of the small <em>herbaria</em> which Rousseau later compiled for Madelon and Julie de la Tour and other young ladies take on the aspect of an innocent bricolage in comparison with the self-destructive business of writing to which he usually submitted himself. A faint aura of unconscious beauty still hovers over these flower collections, in which lichens, sprigs of veronica, lilies-of-the-valley and autumn crocuses have survived, pressed and a little faded, from the 18th century. They can still be admired today in the Musée Carnavalet and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. The&nbsp;herbarium Rousseau compiled for himself, meanwhile – 11 quarto volumes – was, up to the second world war, preserved in the Botanical Museum in Berlin, until, like so much and so many in that city, it went up in flames one night during one of the nocturnal bombing raids.</p><p>A dozen years filled with fear and panic await Rousseau after his departure from the Île Saint-Pierre on 25 October. For three years after his return to France in 1767, Rousseau lives&nbsp;with Thérèse La Vasseur – his housekeeper of 20 years and the mother of his five long-lost children – in remote country seats of the nobility such as Château Trye in Normandy, or in small towns like Bourgoin or Monquin far away in the South, always with the shadow of outlawry hanging over him. When, in 1770, on condition of not publishing anything on political or religious questions, he receives permission to reside in the capital, attempting to eke out a living there by copying out sheet music, the morbid universe surrounding him can no longer be dispelled. \"The children's grimaces,\" Starobinski writes, \"the price of peas in Les Halles, the small shops in the rue Plâtrière – all appeared to be evidence of the same conspiracy.\" This notwithstanding, Rousseau does still succeed in accomplishing a considerable amount. He finishes the <em>Confessions</em> and reads from them in various salons in sessions lasting up to 17 (!) hours, to some extent anticipating <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/franzkafka\" title=\"\">Franz Kafka</a>'s desire to be allowed to read aloud, to an audience condemned to listen, the whole of Stendhal's <em>Éducation sentimentale</em> at one sitting. There follow a few more treatises, on botany and on the government of Poland, as well as the so-called <em>Dialogues</em>, in which Rousseau appears as the judge of Jean-Jacques. In his last two years while out walking he makes notes, on playing cards, for the <em>Rêveries d'un promeneur solitaire</em>, which he completes in April 1780. After&nbsp;that he leaves Paris and moves into a small house in the park at Ermenonville which the Marquis de Girardin has placed at his disposal. He&nbsp;lives there for five more weeks in early summer. He rises at dawn, goes for walks, leaning on his cane, in the beautiful surroundings, collects leaves and flowers and sometimes takes a&nbsp;boat out on to the lake. On 2 July – he&nbsp;is 66 years old – he&nbsp;comes back from one of his walks with a terrible headache. Thérèse helps him into a&nbsp;chair. Felled by a stroke, he collapses on to the floor and, after a few convulsions, dies. Two days later he is buried at Ermenonville on the Isle of Poplars. In&nbsp;the years which follow, the Marquis transforms his estate into a <em>parc du souvenir</em>. He has a classical monument erected, the Swiss chalet is completed, a Temple of Philosophy is constructed with an altar dedicated to reverie. Even the cabin in front of which Rousseau would often sit on a bench, gazing out over the peaceful landscape, is carefully preserved. The park has become a site of pilgrimage, and more than one lady sinks down before the grave on the island, pressing her bosom against the cold stone beneath which Rousseau's earthly remains rest, until, that is, on 9&nbsp;October 1794 they are transferred to the Panthéon. On this memorable day, a group of musicians performed excerpts from the opera <em>Le Devin du village</em>; the oak coffin, triple-lined with lead and further clad with an outer lead covering, was raised from the earth and taken to Paris in a grand and solemn cortège. In all the villages along the route the people lined the streets calling, \"Vive la République! Vive la mémoire de Jean-Jacques Rousseau!\" On the evening of 10 October the procession arrived at the Tuileries, where a huge crowd was waiting with flaming torches. The coffin, covered by&nbsp;a wooden framework painted with the symbols of the revolution, was placed on a bier surrounded by a semicircle of willows. The main part of the ceremony took place the following morning, when the funeral procession continued on its way to the Panthéon, led by a captain of the United States navy bearing the banner of the stars and stripes, and followed by two standard bearers carrying the tricolore and the colours of the Republic of Geneva.</p><p>• Translated by Jo Catling.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/biography\">Biography</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/essays\">Essays</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/wgsebald\">WG Sebald</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/switzerland\">Switzerland</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I had no objections when Sarah wanted to transition. I knew it would be difficult and I worried about whether both of us&nbsp;would experience discrimination and whether it would be scary, but I didn't see a problem adapting to the fact that someone I&nbsp;loved was going to have differently arranged genitals.

Like any big life change, transition affected Sarah's personality. \"Before she transitioned to female, she was really quiet and nerdy and I was doing the talking for two,\" says Sylvia.</p><p>As a woman, Sarah is now forthright and confident. \"It's amazing how people blossom and evolve when their relationships change,\" says Sylvia of Sarah. \"There was something really nice that was brought out when she transitioned.\"</p><p>For Sylvia, the toughest part of Sarah's transition was being forced to replace their marriage with a civil partnership. \"I thought it wouldn't make a difference,\" says Sylvia. \"I'm a&nbsp;scientist, I'm rational. It's just a bit of paper, but it made us cry.\" In contrast to the poetry of the wedding vows, they found the language of the civil partnership ceremony like a business arrangement.</p><p>Sylvia and Sarah hope to remarry when the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/marriagesamesexcouplesbill.html\" title=\"\">marriage (same-sex couples) bill</a> becomes law, but their original marriage can never be restored in the eyes of the law. \"When the registrar pronounced us civil partners it felt like the state was kicking us in the teeth,\" adds Sarah.</p><p>The transformation of their relationship did not end there, however. When Sarah was transitioning, she struck up conversation online with Zoe O'Connell, a computer network manager who is also in the Territorial Army. Zoe was seeking a good place for laser hair removal in East Anglia and Sarah was able to recommend one, so they met for a cup of tea. Bonding over their shared experience of transition, they became good friends.</p><p>While Sarah's path to gender reassignment surgery had been gradual, Zoe had a lightbulb moment. Like Sarah, she had entered into a heterosexual marriage; unlike Sarah, Zoe had three children with her wife. And it was not until the marriage broke down eight years ago that she began to question her gender.</p><p>\"Splitting up, I tried to prove that I&nbsp;was a bloke and failed spectacularly. I&nbsp;had my hair cut short and joined the army,\" Zoe remembers. When she saw a photograph of herself with a shaven head she realised: \"That's so not me.\"</p><p>She began to explore trans issues. \"I&nbsp;was chatting to someone who I knew was trans online and it was a sudden dawning – 'Oh right, this isn't normal, I'm a girl. Shit.'\"</p><p>When Sarah had surgery at a hospital in Brighton, Zoe accompanied Sylvia and they fretted in a pub. Zoe spent a period \"part-time\" before going \"full-time\" four months after Sarah. \"It got ridiculous,\" remembers Zoe. \"At one point I ended up flip-flopping between boy-mode and girl-mode seven times in a day.\" Zoe was treated at the same hospital as Sarah.</p><p>Some months later, Sarah and Zoe went to Brighton again to support a&nbsp;mutual friend's surgery and this time shared a twin-bedded hotel room. \"There was sexual tension in the room,\" remembers Sarah, laughing. Sarah and Zoe were falling in love.</p><p>Feeling increasingly stressed about their feelings, Sarah, Zoe and Sylvia sat&nbsp;down to talk and, together, they \"renegotiated the bounds of the existing relationship,\" as Sarah puts it.</p><p>Soon afterwards, Zoe moved into Sarah and Sylvia's house. At first, they&nbsp;tried sleeping together in a big bed but the person in the middle was always very uncomfortable. Now Zoe has her&nbsp;own room and often sleeps there, although the three all move between bedrooms.</p><p>Many people might assume that Sylvia would struggle to cope with her husband becoming her same-sex partner. For her to then accept the transformation of a monogamous relationship into a polyamorous one must be an enormous strain. But the striking thing when I meet Sylvia, Sarah and Zoe at their home is the absence of strain: their unconventional domestic arrangements – they also have five snakes – soon seem completely normal, perhaps because they are all so at ease with each other.</p><p>\"A lot of people looking at this from the outside would probably see you as&nbsp;the long-suffering wife,\" says Sarah to Sylvia.</p><p>\"None of the gender or poly stuff has ever been a problem,\" replies Sylvia. \"Irritating personal habits are far worse.\"</p><p>Sylvia admits she felt \"a little bit excluded\" when Sarah and Zoe were going through transition – \"I could never quite know what it was like\" – but this period also helped her bond with Zoe: they both worried about Sarah's operation.</p><p>What about polyamory, though? \"We had a lot to gain and nothing to lose really,\" says Sylvia. \"Transition made my relationship with Sarah that&nbsp;much stronger because we'd been&nbsp;through so much together, so it&nbsp;was like, well, we can do anything after&nbsp;this.\"</p><p>Sarah, Sylvia and Zoe are not \"poly-evangelists\" but simply say it works for them. \"Some people are quite jealous or need that level of commitment from&nbsp;one person that you can't get in a&nbsp;poly relationship so it doesn't suit everyone,\" says Zoe.</p><p>Isn't three fundamentally an awkward number? \"It can be really handy,\" says Sylvia. \"If two of us are massively disagreeing about whether to do something around the house, we can have someone to break the deadlock. As long as you're careful enough so it doesn't end up with two people picking on one.\"</p><p>\"We're all adult enough not to do that,\" adds Sarah.</p><p>Their relationship is&nbsp;a \"triangle\" (a&nbsp;\"V-shaped\" polyamorous relationship in which not all three members of the relationship are connected would be more tricky, they say), and they share many passions. Zoe and Sylvia go <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/\" title=\"\">geocaching</a> together; Sarah and Zoe go horseriding. All three women have Lib Dem politics (Zoe hopes to become the first openly trans person to stand for parliament for a&nbsp;major political party) and computing in&nbsp;common. They also enjoy climbing, mountaineering and canyoning together. With Zoe already having three children, they are not planning any more. \"I'm not into children,\" says Sylvia decisively.</p><p>\"I've got three already,\" adds Zoe. And Sarah? \"Governed by the other two really,\" she laughs.</p><p></p><p>Zoe maintains a good relationship with her ex-wife and sees their two daughters and son every weekend; she, Sarah and Sylvia usually stay with them at Zoe's parents house. As children tend to be, hers are very accepting (they don't call her Mum or Dad – simply Zoe) although Zoe admits to feeling bad if \"they get some stick\" at school. \"They were too young to understand gender when I transitioned and when the three of us got together they just mentally shrugged,\" she says. \"It is normal to them.\"</p><p>Zoe has had no problems in the Territorial Army either, but it has been harder to gain acceptance from older family members. While Zoe has an excellent relationship with her parents and her brother, Sarah has been estranged from her father since her transition, although her relationship with her mother is \"better than it's ever been\". Sylvia's mother is \"accepting\", but her grandparents struggled to adapt to her husband becoming her female civil partner, although Sylvia and Sarah were reconciled with them before they died.</p><p>Living in Cambridge, they rarely experience discrimination or abuse. Sarah is not the city's first openly trans councillor, and when they pop down to their local real-ale pub: \"No one bats an eyelid. We're probably some of the less 'out there' people,\" says Zoe.</p><p>They do not hide their living arrangements but Zoe says they invariably develop a language of \"partners\" and other careful phrasing to avoid having to constantly explain themselves. \"If your living arrangements or social situation is abnormal, you don't just come out once, you come out all the time,\" she says. But occasionally it can be fun to observe people's reactions. \"I come out as trans first and then bisexual,\" says Zoe. \"Just when people are getting really confused you hit them with 'poly' and their mind just explodes.\"</p><p>All three women feel liberated by their different experiences of transition and they know quite a few trans people now living polyamorous lives. \"Gender transition is one of the most sexually taboo things you can do, and you do it and you realise the world doesn't end. Then you start thinking, what other things have I always taken for granted that are just wrong?\" says Sarah. \"In some ways I resent being born trans because it's been a lot of pain, a lot of hassle, and it has dominated my life. But at other times I almost feel grateful because it has given me an attitude that almost nothing is sacred and I don't have to be a prisoner to this very English 'mustn't make a fuss, mustn't challenge things' life of quiet desperation.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/transgender\">Transgender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gender\">Gender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality\">Sexuality</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickbarkham\">Patrick Barkham</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Zoe spent a period \"part-time\" before going \"full-time\" four months after Sarah. \"It got ridiculous,\" remembers Zoe. \"At one point I ended up flip-flopping between boy-mode and girl-mode seven times in a day.\" Zoe was treated at the same hospital as Sarah.</p><p>Some months later, Sarah and Zoe went to Brighton again to support a&nbsp;mutual friend's surgery and this time shared a twin-bedded hotel room. \"There was sexual tension in the room,\" remembers Sarah, laughing. Sarah and Zoe were falling in love.</p><p>Feeling increasingly stressed about their feelings, Sarah, Zoe and Sylvia sat&nbsp;down to talk and, together, they \"renegotiated the bounds of the existing relationship,\" as Sarah puts it.</p><p>Soon afterwards, Zoe moved into Sarah and Sylvia's house. At first, they&nbsp;tried sleeping together in a big bed but the person in the middle was always very uncomfortable. Now Zoe has her&nbsp;own room and often sleeps there, although the three all move between bedrooms.</p><p>Many people might assume that Sylvia would struggle to cope with her husband becoming her same-sex partner. For her to then accept the transformation of a monogamous relationship into a polyamorous one must be an enormous strain. But the striking thing when I meet Sylvia, Sarah and Zoe at their home is the absence of strain: their unconventional domestic arrangements – they also have five snakes – soon seem completely normal, perhaps because they are all so at ease with each other.</p><p>\"A lot of people looking at this from the outside would probably see you as&nbsp;the long-suffering wife,\" says Sarah to Sylvia.</p><p>\"None of the gender or poly stuff has ever been a problem,\" replies Sylvia. \"Irritating personal habits are far worse.\"</p><p>Sylvia admits she felt \"a little bit excluded\" when Sarah and Zoe were going through transition – \"I could never quite know what it was like\" – but this period also helped her bond with Zoe: they both worried about Sarah's operation.</p><p>What about polyamory, though? \"We had a lot to gain and nothing to lose really,\" says Sylvia. \"Transition made my relationship with Sarah that&nbsp;much stronger because we'd been&nbsp;through so much together, so it&nbsp;was like, well, we can do anything after&nbsp;this.\"</p><p>Sarah, Sylvia and Zoe are not \"poly-evangelists\" but simply say it works for them. \"Some people are quite jealous or need that level of commitment from&nbsp;one person that you can't get in a&nbsp;poly relationship so it doesn't suit everyone,\" says Zoe.</p><p>Isn't three fundamentally an awkward number? \"It can be really handy,\" says Sylvia. \"If two of us are massively disagreeing about whether to do something around the house, we can have someone to break the deadlock. As long as you're careful enough so it doesn't end up with two people picking on one.\"</p><p>\"We're all adult enough not to do that,\" adds Sarah.</p><p>Their relationship is&nbsp;a \"triangle\" (a&nbsp;\"V-shaped\" polyamorous relationship in which not all three members of the relationship are connected would be more tricky, they say), and they share many passions. Zoe and Sylvia go <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/\" title=\"\">geocaching</a> together; Sarah and Zoe go horseriding. All three women have Lib Dem politics (Zoe hopes to become the first openly trans person to stand for parliament for a&nbsp;major political party) and computing in&nbsp;common. They also enjoy climbing, mountaineering and canyoning together. With Zoe already having three children, they are not planning any more. \"I'm not into children,\" says Sylvia decisively.</p><p>\"I've got three already,\" adds Zoe. And Sarah? \"Governed by the other two really,\" she laughs.</p><p></p><p>Zoe maintains a good relationship with her ex-wife and sees their two daughters and son every weekend; she, Sarah and Sylvia usually stay with them at Zoe's parents house. As children tend to be, hers are very accepting (they don't call her Mum or Dad – simply Zoe) although Zoe admits to feeling bad if \"they get some stick\" at school. \"They were too young to understand gender when I transitioned and when the three of us got together they just mentally shrugged,\" she says. \"It is normal to them.\"</p><p>Zoe has had no problems in the Territorial Army either, but it has been harder to gain acceptance from older family members. While Zoe has an excellent relationship with her parents and her brother, Sarah has been estranged from her father since her transition, although her relationship with her mother is \"better than it's ever been\". Sylvia's mother is \"accepting\", but her grandparents struggled to adapt to her husband becoming her female civil partner, although Sylvia and Sarah were reconciled with them before they died.</p><p>Living in Cambridge, they rarely experience discrimination or abuse. Sarah is not the city's first openly trans councillor, and when they pop down to their local real-ale pub: \"No one bats an eyelid. We're probably some of the less 'out there' people,\" says Zoe.</p><p>They do not hide their living arrangements but Zoe says they invariably develop a language of \"partners\" and other careful phrasing to avoid having to constantly explain themselves. \"If your living arrangements or social situation is abnormal, you don't just come out once, you come out all the time,\" she says. But occasionally it can be fun to observe people's reactions. \"I come out as trans first and then bisexual,\" says Zoe. \"Just when people are getting really confused you hit them with 'poly' and their mind just explodes.\"</p><p>All three women feel liberated by their different experiences of transition and they know quite a few trans people now living polyamorous lives. \"Gender transition is one of the most sexually taboo things you can do, and you do it and you realise the world doesn't end. Then you start thinking, what other things have I always taken for granted that are just wrong?\" says Sarah. \"In some ways I resent being born trans because it's been a lot of pain, a lot of hassle, and it has dominated my life. But at other times I almost feel grateful because it has given me an attitude that almost nothing is sacred and I don't have to be a prisoner to this very English 'mustn't make a fuss, mustn't challenge things' life of quiet desperation.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/transgender\">Transgender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gender\">Gender</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality\">Sexuality</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickbarkham\">Patrick Barkham</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A bright, tenacious young Frenchwoman, she had a flair for languages and excelled at school but decided to leave Rouen University in her second year to improve her spoken English. She had struck gold with a kind host family in south London who made her feel at home, taking her on family holidays to Cornwall and Dorset. A month or so into her stay, her French boyfriend came to visit, and it was after taking him back to Charing Cross station one Thursday evening that Marie's life changed irreparably.</p><p>There was a bus strike that night, 22 April 1993, and she was having trouble getting home. Outside Eltham station the 286 bus stopped, the driver helpfully asking Marie where she needed to get to. While they talked, two young black men ran up and the driver opened the back doors to let them on. Eighteen-year-old Stephen Lawrence and his friend Duwayne Brooks boarded the bus.</p><p>Today Marie is tucked up on her sofa, gripping a strong cup of coffee, at her home deep in French wine country. Now an English teacher, she speaks fluently but with a strong accent, pausing occasionally to check more complex words in a thick dictionary to make sure her point is made precisely. She retells her story with calm and focus, sifting documentation from a meticulously well-ordered cupboard of files, diaries and photographs. But often she becomes more animated, raising her voice and throwing out questions, and this happens when she talks about Lawrence.</p><p>The driver made an unscheduled stop that night in 1993, to let Marie off at the roundabout in Well Hall Road. He told her to wait for a 161 or 122 to Woolwich. Lawrence, Brooks and another passenger, Royston Westbrook, also got out and headed to the same bus stop.</p><p>They waited together for several minutes. Marie remembers those moments vividly and has revisited them many times over the past 20 years. \"They looked young and cool, and I thought they looked very happy. I even thought they were doing dance steps. There was no aggression in them at all. They just looked like young men I would be happy to know.\"</p><p>Marie shuffled forward to let Lawrence read the timetable behind her. \"A couple of minutes,\" he said to Brooks. She crouched on the kerb, smoking a cigarette to make herself feel more assured, she recalls. Another man, Joseph Shepherd, walked up to the stop. Moments later, impatient, and with Lawrence anxious to get home, he and his friend walked back towards the roundabout to see if they could see a bus approaching.</p><p>From her position at the bus stop, Marie could see the pair walk down the hill. A moment later, a few yards apart, they turned back. Some sudden movement attracted her attention, a commotion, and she could see Lawrence on the ground, a group of men surrounding him and kicking, holding him down, she remembers.</p><p>That the attack was over in less than 10 seconds betrays how brutal and violent it really was, a knife severing two arteries and piercing a lung. Lawrence had minutes to live.</p><p>Marie and the two men at the bus stop saw Lawrence pick himself up and, leaving his bag on the floor, run up the hill on the other side of the road after Brooks. \"Oh, ça va,\" she said to herself, assuming that as he was running, he must be OK. She lost sight of them and the bus finally arrived.</p><p>As the bus passed Lawrence, passengers looked down from the window to see him collapsed on the pavement, a small group gathered around him.</p><p>Marie remembers the bus stopping again and two more men got on – one of them agitated, breathless and with bad teeth. One handed something to the other, then ran off the bus to where Lawrence was lying, as if to check something, and then ran back again. He took something back from the other man.</p><p>\"I wondered if I should get down off the bus but I thought that there was nothing I could do to help, so I stayed,\" she said. \"I saw that Stephen was lying on the floor, but this image is so upsetting because now I know he was dying.\"</p><p>A young couple heading home from a church service, Conor and Louise Taaffe, were among those who had stopped to help Lawrence. the last words he heard as Mrs Taaffe held his head in her hands were: \"You are loved. You are loved.\"</p><p>Two days later, Marie was thumbing through a newspaper in a Dorset cottage on a weekend away with her host family. She began reading about a young black man murdered at a bus stop in south London, realising with horror that this was the attack she had seen on the Thursday night. Struggling to talk, she showed the paper to the family, who sat her down with a brandy and phoned the police on her behalf.</p><p>\"24 April: Dorset, lu journal. Ai appris pour le meurtre … Choc,\" read the short note in her diary that night, in her delicate écriture cursive hand. She spent three hours with the police the following Monday and six hours with the police two weeks later. She remembers they were attentive, the translator putting her at ease by rattling off tales of working for the footballer Eric Cantona.</p><p>On that day in 1993, a sketch artist drew an image of the aggressive man she says she saw on the bus but she was not happy with it; five years later she saw a picture of a snarling David Norris being pelted with eggs leaving the public inquiry – an expression that, she said, looked like the man she had seen on the bus. \"Norris said he wasn't in the area, but they didn't give me a chance to go to the identity parade, even to eliminate anyone.\"</p><p>The Lawrence case has arguably been the most high-profile in the history of the Metropolitan police, dogged from the outset by incompetence, corruption and racism. A lack of evidence led the initial 1994 case to collapse, and a private prosecution by Lawrence's parents failed in 1996 after evidence was ruled inadmissible.</p><p>An insubstantial 1997 inquiry found \"weaknesses\" but no racism, prompting a more robust judicial review from Sir William Macpherson that found \"professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership\". As a consequence of the case, the government scrapped the double jeopardy legal principle in 2005, allowing suspects to be tried twice for the same crime. In 2008, cold-case scientists found a minute spot of Lawrence's blood on Gary Dobson's jacket, prompting a full retrial in 2011. In January 2012 Dobson and Norris, two of the original five suspects, were finally found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>The Met said it would not be appropriate to comment on Marie's story because of ongoing lines of inquiry. Outside of the trials, Marie has had little communication with the police over the past 20 years, though one senior officer has stayed in contact and continued to support her. Despite this, no one has yet explained why she was not invited to join Royston Westbrook and Joseph Shepherd at that first ID parade or explained who the two men on the bus really were.</p><p>Her host family were very supportive in the first months after the murder in 1993, but she was struggling to process the shock of that night and it weighed heavily on her young mind. Why had Lawrence been attacked? What was the real motivation of those young white men? Should she have gone to help him as he lay on the street?</p><p>Back in Normandy that September, her parents and friends were uncomfortable listening to what had happened, and didn't realise the significance of a high-profile murder which had savaged the credibility of policing and raised racial tensions in the UK. She describes the sense of <em>pudique</em>, the French version of a stiff upper lip. \"Sometimes with friends I would say I had been the witness of a murder but people didn't want to hear about it, didn't know what to do with that information. I felt very isolated. They told me to stop thinking about it so I had to bury it inside, like a family secret.\"</p><p>Marie's life drifted through trauma into denial and beyond. She began to seek out friendship and recognition from black friends, constructing a naive world in which white people were bad and black people good. \"If I hadn't witnessed Stephen Lawrence's murder I wouldn't have been so interested in seeking out black stories and black people. It changed my world.\" She moved, with her mixed-race boyfriend, to the racially diverse Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, where she started university. There she found an academic release in writing about the new politics of multiculturalism and applied for a grant to study in South Africa for three months.</p><p>Marie, then 23, was caught up in the excitement and optimism of post-apartheid South Africa, but also acknowledges she was naive and put herself at risk, spending time in the ghettos of Cape Town, where she was often the only white, western face. One day, a man she had interviewed held a knife to her throat, holding her captive for 10 days and only releasing her when the French embassy came looking for her. She fled back to Réunion and knows she was lucky to escape with her life.</p><p>\"I was very young and naive, trying to open my heart to people,\" said Marie. \"South Africa is a very violent place now and very different to what they were dreaming, but I wanted to understand how apartheid had developed and how it had been defeated. And I suppose I was trying to understand why there was racism in the world.\"</p><p>Marie completed her masters degree and struck up a relationship with a well-known black musician who gave her love, support and understanding at a time when she was incredibly vulnerable. They had a child in 2002, but she says the relationship became destructive and she moved back to France. Five years on, Marie and her former partner have an amicable relationship and he sees his son regularly, but she had to live through yet more trauma to get to this point.</p><p>Throughout her struggle runs the thread of Lawrence's story. Marie testified as a witness at the first trial in 1996, which collapsed due to lack of evidence. She returned to talk to police in 2000 but was overwhelmed by returning to the bus stop and her memory blanked. The image of Lawrence lying collapsed on that street has continued to haunt her.</p><p>Her work with a specialist trauma psychologist uses a technique which explores and neutralises these kinds of traumatic memories. It has clearly been powerful and effective for Marie, who says she would be dead had it not been for her emotional resourcefulness. \"I had never really cried until that first session in 2011. I kept it all inside. I talked about feeling guilty, about not being able to help him. It had been like a boomerang. I wanted to throw everything away from me, but it kept coming back.\"</p><p>The last time the boomerang came back was on a slow day at work in November 2012, when Marie came across an extract from a book by the journalist Brian Cathcart, now well known for his role leading the Hacked Off press campaign. Published in 1999, The Case of Stephen Lawrence has become almost the definitive public record of the murder, but Marie has become near-obsessional about his description of her role that night.</p><p>Cathcart writes that Lawrence and Brooks chased the bus to the Eltham station stop where \"by good fortune … the bus was delayed by a young French woman who was asking the bus driver questions\".</p><p>The phrase \"good fortune\" has tortured her. \"It was the first time I had heard of any delay and I realised that if I hadn't been there, Stephen would not have been able to catch that bus. When I read this, all my guilt and memories came back.</p><p>\"I already felt powerless that night. I couldn't do anything – I was only a young woman. But the bus stopped and the driver asked me which bus I was waiting for. I didn't stop the bus and I didn't cause the delay.\"</p><p>In Marie's mind, the traumatic events of the past 20 years are knitted together, the guilt of one woven to the guilt of the next. The distress caused by what she saw as the blame attributed in Cathcart's book was compounded by her realisation that her name was so public, so indelibly part of the Lawrence story; she had asked for anonymity when first questioned by police in 1993 and no one explained that, unlike in France, she would be identified in open court and in press coverage.</p><p>Cathcart says no one could reasonably believe that catching that bus, or her role in that, was any part of the reason Lawrence was murdered. \"There were a thousand and more contingencies that placed those two young men at that bus stop at that moment,\" he said. \"And of course the responsibility for the murder really lies with the perpetrators.\"</p><p>Marie obsesses over the details of the case; the characters on the bus; whether corrupt police were protecting suspects. Evidence given at the time suggests that Norris did not run on to the bus with Marie that night. Witness B saw Norris, Neil Acourt and two others running out of Cobbett Road – in the opposite direction to the bus, Cathcart points out, while Witness K saw Norris at a nearby house one hour later. Neither of those statements are consistent with taking a bus towards Woolwich.</p><p>On the day that Norris and Dobson were convicted in January 2012, Marie was at work and watched the news, elated, on TV. \"I saw how people were reacting, the relief and the happiness, but I had nobody to celebrate with. Nobody understood what this meant.\"</p><p>The recognition Marie craves is that witnesses are also victims of these crimes. \"If I could talk to my 19-year-old self I would say that there are other ways to repair your life than some sort of black and white quest,\" she says. \"When the police proceedings are all over, you are on your own. Witnesses of violent events can develop traumas and change the way they perceive life, and they need to be supported. It is not an accident – it is a murder and there is no way to explain it to yourself. It follows you like a ghost. And I know I ended up making wrong decisions for myself that I wouldn't otherwise have made.\"</p><p>Now 39, Marie and her son are in a new, comfortable home, a place of peace completely unconnected to the violence of her past. Her life is calmer, reassuringly uneventful, and she wants to move on. For Marie, that means the three remaining suspects – Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight – behind bars. \"I want Stephen Lawrence to lie in peace, with his murderers in jail.\"</p><p>It also means a visit to Lawrence's grave in Jamaica to say goodbye; it wasn't until 2011, at the Old Bailey retrial, that she met the Lawrence family and could tell them that she shared their pain. \"I think maybe in life fate gives you what it knows you have the courage to deal with. I do think life is wonderful. It is an amazing thing, to be alive.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police\">Police</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jemimakiss\">Jemima Kiss</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He took something back from the other man.</p><p>\"I wondered if I should get down off the bus but I thought that there was nothing I could do to help, so I stayed,\" she said. \"I saw that Stephen was lying on the floor, but this image is so upsetting because now I know he was dying.\"</p><p>A young couple heading home from a church service, Conor and Louise Taaffe, were among those who had stopped to help Lawrence. the last words he heard as Mrs Taaffe held his head in her hands were: \"You are loved. You are loved.\"</p><p>Two days later, Marie was thumbing through a newspaper in a Dorset cottage on a weekend away with her host family. She began reading about a young black man murdered at a bus stop in south London, realising with horror that this was the attack she had seen on the Thursday night. Struggling to talk, she showed the paper to the family, who sat her down with a brandy and phoned the police on her behalf.</p><p>\"24 April: Dorset, lu journal. Ai appris pour le meurtre … Choc,\" read the short note in her diary that night, in her delicate écriture cursive hand. She spent three hours with the police the following Monday and six hours with the police two weeks later. She remembers they were attentive, the translator putting her at ease by rattling off tales of working for the footballer Eric Cantona.</p><p>On that day in 1993, a sketch artist drew an image of the aggressive man she says she saw on the bus but she was not happy with it; five years later she saw a picture of a snarling David Norris being pelted with eggs leaving the public inquiry – an expression that, she said, looked like the man she had seen on the bus. \"Norris said he wasn't in the area, but they didn't give me a chance to go to the identity parade, even to eliminate anyone.\"</p><p>The Lawrence case has arguably been the most high-profile in the history of the Metropolitan police, dogged from the outset by incompetence, corruption and racism. A lack of evidence led the initial 1994 case to collapse, and a private prosecution by Lawrence's parents failed in 1996 after evidence was ruled inadmissible.</p><p>An insubstantial 1997 inquiry found \"weaknesses\" but no racism, prompting a more robust judicial review from Sir William Macpherson that found \"professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership\". As a consequence of the case, the government scrapped the double jeopardy legal principle in 2005, allowing suspects to be tried twice for the same crime. In 2008, cold-case scientists found a minute spot of Lawrence's blood on Gary Dobson's jacket, prompting a full retrial in 2011. In January 2012 Dobson and Norris, two of the original five suspects, were finally found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>The Met said it would not be appropriate to comment on Marie's story because of ongoing lines of inquiry. Outside of the trials, Marie has had little communication with the police over the past 20 years, though one senior officer has stayed in contact and continued to support her. Despite this, no one has yet explained why she was not invited to join Royston Westbrook and Joseph Shepherd at that first ID parade or explained who the two men on the bus really were.</p><p>Her host family were very supportive in the first months after the murder in 1993, but she was struggling to process the shock of that night and it weighed heavily on her young mind. Why had Lawrence been attacked? What was the real motivation of those young white men? Should she have gone to help him as he lay on the street?</p><p>Back in Normandy that September, her parents and friends were uncomfortable listening to what had happened, and didn't realise the significance of a high-profile murder which had savaged the credibility of policing and raised racial tensions in the UK. She describes the sense of <em>pudique</em>, the French version of a stiff upper lip. \"Sometimes with friends I would say I had been the witness of a murder but people didn't want to hear about it, didn't know what to do with that information. I felt very isolated. They told me to stop thinking about it so I had to bury it inside, like a family secret.\"</p><p>Marie's life drifted through trauma into denial and beyond. She began to seek out friendship and recognition from black friends, constructing a naive world in which white people were bad and black people good. \"If I hadn't witnessed Stephen Lawrence's murder I wouldn't have been so interested in seeking out black stories and black people. It changed my world.\" She moved, with her mixed-race boyfriend, to the racially diverse Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, where she started university. There she found an academic release in writing about the new politics of multiculturalism and applied for a grant to study in South Africa for three months.</p><p>Marie, then 23, was caught up in the excitement and optimism of post-apartheid South Africa, but also acknowledges she was naive and put herself at risk, spending time in the ghettos of Cape Town, where she was often the only white, western face. One day, a man she had interviewed held a knife to her throat, holding her captive for 10 days and only releasing her when the French embassy came looking for her. She fled back to Réunion and knows she was lucky to escape with her life.</p><p>\"I was very young and naive, trying to open my heart to people,\" said Marie. \"South Africa is a very violent place now and very different to what they were dreaming, but I wanted to understand how apartheid had developed and how it had been defeated. And I suppose I was trying to understand why there was racism in the world.\"</p><p>Marie completed her masters degree and struck up a relationship with a well-known black musician who gave her love, support and understanding at a time when she was incredibly vulnerable. They had a child in 2002, but she says the relationship became destructive and she moved back to France. Five years on, Marie and her former partner have an amicable relationship and he sees his son regularly, but she had to live through yet more trauma to get to this point.</p><p>Throughout her struggle runs the thread of Lawrence's story. Marie testified as a witness at the first trial in 1996, which collapsed due to lack of evidence. She returned to talk to police in 2000 but was overwhelmed by returning to the bus stop and her memory blanked. The image of Lawrence lying collapsed on that street has continued to haunt her.</p><p>Her work with a specialist trauma psychologist uses a technique which explores and neutralises these kinds of traumatic memories. It has clearly been powerful and effective for Marie, who says she would be dead had it not been for her emotional resourcefulness. \"I had never really cried until that first session in 2011. I kept it all inside. I talked about feeling guilty, about not being able to help him. It had been like a boomerang. I wanted to throw everything away from me, but it kept coming back.\"</p><p>The last time the boomerang came back was on a slow day at work in November 2012, when Marie came across an extract from a book by the journalist Brian Cathcart, now well known for his role leading the Hacked Off press campaign. Published in 1999, The Case of Stephen Lawrence has become almost the definitive public record of the murder, but Marie has become near-obsessional about his description of her role that night.</p><p>Cathcart writes that Lawrence and Brooks chased the bus to the Eltham station stop where \"by good fortune … the bus was delayed by a young French woman who was asking the bus driver questions\".</p><p>The phrase \"good fortune\" has tortured her. \"It was the first time I had heard of any delay and I realised that if I hadn't been there, Stephen would not have been able to catch that bus. When I read this, all my guilt and memories came back.</p><p>\"I already felt powerless that night. I couldn't do anything – I was only a young woman. But the bus stopped and the driver asked me which bus I was waiting for. I didn't stop the bus and I didn't cause the delay.\"</p><p>In Marie's mind, the traumatic events of the past 20 years are knitted together, the guilt of one woven to the guilt of the next. The distress caused by what she saw as the blame attributed in Cathcart's book was compounded by her realisation that her name was so public, so indelibly part of the Lawrence story; she had asked for anonymity when first questioned by police in 1993 and no one explained that, unlike in France, she would be identified in open court and in press coverage.</p><p>Cathcart says no one could reasonably believe that catching that bus, or her role in that, was any part of the reason Lawrence was murdered. \"There were a thousand and more contingencies that placed those two young men at that bus stop at that moment,\" he said. \"And of course the responsibility for the murder really lies with the perpetrators.\"</p><p>Marie obsesses over the details of the case; the characters on the bus; whether corrupt police were protecting suspects. Evidence given at the time suggests that Norris did not run on to the bus with Marie that night. Witness B saw Norris, Neil Acourt and two others running out of Cobbett Road – in the opposite direction to the bus, Cathcart points out, while Witness K saw Norris at a nearby house one hour later. Neither of those statements are consistent with taking a bus towards Woolwich.</p><p>On the day that Norris and Dobson were convicted in January 2012, Marie was at work and watched the news, elated, on TV. \"I saw how people were reacting, the relief and the happiness, but I had nobody to celebrate with. Nobody understood what this meant.\"</p><p>The recognition Marie craves is that witnesses are also victims of these crimes. \"If I could talk to my 19-year-old self I would say that there are other ways to repair your life than some sort of black and white quest,\" she says. \"When the police proceedings are all over, you are on your own. Witnesses of violent events can develop traumas and change the way they perceive life, and they need to be supported. It is not an accident – it is a murder and there is no way to explain it to yourself. It follows you like a ghost. And I know I ended up making wrong decisions for myself that I wouldn't otherwise have made.\"</p><p>Now 39, Marie and her son are in a new, comfortable home, a place of peace completely unconnected to the violence of her past. Her life is calmer, reassuringly uneventful, and she wants to move on. For Marie, that means the three remaining suspects – Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight – behind bars. \"I want Stephen Lawrence to lie in peace, with his murderers in jail.\"</p><p>It also means a visit to Lawrence's grave in Jamaica to say goodbye; it wasn't until 2011, at the Old Bailey retrial, that she met the Lawrence family and could tell them that she shared their pain. \"I think maybe in life fate gives you what it knows you have the courage to deal with. I do think life is wonderful. It is an amazing thing, to be alive.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police\">Police</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jemimakiss\">Jemima Kiss</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

More than 200 people were injured.</p><p>As the recovery operation wound down and the last of about 175 damaged homes were cleared, officials said they hoped there might be no more fatalities.</p><p>\"There may be one or two more. It may be that nobody is missing,\" McLennan County judge Scott Felton told a press conference in West, about 20 miles north of Waco.</p><p>Earlier in the day, there were estimates that up to 60 people were still unaccounted for. \"I'd be surprised if it's more than a few,\" Felton said. The confusion arose, he said, because relatives were reporting people missing because they had not been in touch. Many were later located in hotels or staying with friends.</p><p>Donald Adair, owner of the West Fertiliser Company, spoke for the first time about the blast, in giant tanks of ammonia-based chemicals, which sent a huge fireball high into the sky. The National Geological Survey recorded a seismic event of 2.1 magnitude.</p><p>\"As a lifelong resident, my heart is broken with grief for the tragic losses to so many families in our community. Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered,\" Adair said. He also paid tribute to first responders and rescue workers.</p><p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor, toured the stricken town on Friday . \"Now is the time for recovery and to ask the appropriate questions,\" he said.</p><p>Tommy Muska, the West mayor, said most of the dead were emergency personnel who had been responding to an earlier fire at the plant. Five were members of the West volunteer fire department.</p><p>Sergeant Jason Reyes of the Texas public safety department, which co-ordinated the rescue effort, said all the bodies were taken to the Dallas forensic laboratory for identification.</p><p>\"It is with a heavy heart that I can confirm 12 individuals have been recovered from the fertiliser plant explosion. We know these bodies were in the area of the explosion,\" he said. He later updated the number of deaths to 14.</p><p>He said 50 homes were destroyed, along with three fire engines and an ambulance.</p><p>Officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), assisted by the US Chemical Safety Board, have started an inquiry, which could take six months.</p><p>Investigators will focus on which chemicals were stored by the company, which was licensed for 54,000lbs of anhydrous ammonia, a liquid nitrogen agricultural fertiliser that is stored in large reinforced steel tanks.</p><p>Officials at first suggested the explosion was caused by the anhydrous ammonia igniting, but it was revealed on Thursdaythrough Texas state records that the plant also possessed 270 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a much more volatile, dry solid, at the end of 2012. Records also suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a $2,300 (£1,500) fine for deficiencies in the plant's risk management plan in 2006.</p><p>According to data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA, the last documented regulatory visit to the plant took place in late 2007, as a followup to a complaint of an odour coming from the site.

More than 200 people were injured.</p><p>As the recovery operation wound down and the last of about 175 damaged homes were cleared, officials said they hoped there might be no more fatalities.</p><p>\"There may be one or two more. It may be that nobody is missing,\" McLennan County judge Scott Felton told a press conference in West, about 20 miles north of Waco.</p><p>Earlier in the day, there were estimates that up to 60 people were still unaccounted for. \"I'd be surprised if it's more than a few,\" Felton said. The confusion arose, he said, because relatives were reporting people missing because they had not been in touch. Many were later located in hotels or staying with friends.</p><p>Donald Adair, owner of the West Fertiliser Company, spoke for the first time about the blast, in giant tanks of ammonia-based chemicals, which sent a huge fireball high into the sky. The National Geological Survey recorded a seismic event of 2.1 magnitude.</p><p>\"As a lifelong resident, my heart is broken with grief for the tragic losses to so many families in our community. Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered,\" Adair said. He also paid tribute to first responders and rescue workers.</p><p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor, toured the stricken town on Friday . \"Now is the time for recovery and to ask the appropriate questions,\" he said.</p><p>Tommy Muska, the West mayor, said most of the dead were emergency personnel who had been responding to an earlier fire at the plant. Five were members of the West volunteer fire department.</p><p>Sergeant Jason Reyes of the Texas public safety department, which co-ordinated the rescue effort, said all the bodies were taken to the Dallas forensic laboratory for identification.</p><p>\"It is with a heavy heart that I can confirm 12 individuals have been recovered from the fertiliser plant explosion. We know these bodies were in the area of the explosion,\" he said. He later updated the number of deaths to 14.</p><p>He said 50 homes were destroyed, along with three fire engines and an ambulance.</p><p>Officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), assisted by the US Chemical Safety Board, have started an inquiry, which could take six months.</p><p>Investigators will focus on which chemicals were stored by the company, which was licensed for 54,000lbs of anhydrous ammonia, a liquid nitrogen agricultural fertiliser that is stored in large reinforced steel tanks.</p><p>Officials at first suggested the explosion was caused by the anhydrous ammonia igniting, but it was revealed on Thursdaythrough Texas state records that the plant also possessed 270 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a much more volatile, dry solid, at the end of 2012. Records also suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a $2,300 (£1,500) fine for deficiencies in the plant's risk management plan in 2006.</p><p>According to data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA, the last documented regulatory visit to the plant took place in late 2007, as a followup to a complaint of an odour coming from the site. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not made a site visit since 1985.</p><p>Greg Abbott, the Texas state attorney, said on Thursday it was too early to say if anybody might be held criminally negligent.</p><p>Adair's statement said his company was working closely with investigating agencies. \"We are presenting all employees for interviews and will assist in the fact-finding to whatever degree possible. We pledge to do everything we can to understand what happened to ensure nothing like this ever happens again in any community,\" it said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas-fertiliser-plant-explosion\">Texas fertiliser plant explosion</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/richardluscombe\">Richard Luscombe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth.  Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core  idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace.  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example.  So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible.  </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO.  </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\"  </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave.  </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google.  </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet.  </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet. North Korea, I now understand, has its own internet. They have people copying the content that the respected leader thinks is OK and they put it on internal servers and they call that the internet. That's the crudest and least effective strategy, in my view.</p><p>Let me give you some examples of what governments could do. There is something called the DNS, which is the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DNS.html\">Domain Name Service</a>, which is how you get to things, so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">guardian.co.uk</a>. If you go in and you programme that in a certain way, you can actually delete things. You can also, at the protocol level, lock ports, so you can block, for example, access to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> in its entirety. So those have the property that it's not a flat open internet but rather it depends on which country you're in. </p><p>There are things called VPNs. The Chinese Government, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/13/china-cracks-down-on-vpn-use\">plays a game we call whack-a-mole</a>, where every time a VPN shows up, they shut it down and people move. Using modern encryption there are ways of getting even more sophisticated versions of this kind of thing working. The problem is that if you put these restrictions in place, the elites will figure out a way to get around it, but the average person won't, because they don't have time, or knowledge, or education, so there's a real loss of information. </p><h2>On education</h2><p>What's the number one education problem in the developing world? Literacy and childhood education. Can we solve that? Absolutely, at a 100% level. We simply preload phones with all that teaching material. You do it in their local language and, because people are going to be using their phones, they might as well use them to learn how to read. That's easy.</p><p>What's the next problem? The developing world don't have textbooks. So what's another solution? Preload their tablets. We have the textbooks for maths and science, in their languages. </p><p>So now let's talk about college. Well in college you've got new online courses, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">they're called MOOCs</a>, and the anecdotal evidence is that 90% of the viewers are not from the US, and the majority are not from the developed world. That tells me that if you go to Rwanda, Kenya, so forth, you've got an incredibly smart person who does not have textbooks and is hungry for the latest college and graduate school level education, they're going to get it online. </p><p>So what do you need for that? You need bandwidth. If you're in a city in those countries you're going to get that education. If you're in a rural area, you may not, unless those governments are smart enough to get the 3G/4G networks out to the rural areas. </p><p>In South Sudan we asked, \"How do you get information to the people who are in north Sudan, or the Sudan people the government is busy hurting?\" The simplest way to get them information is to smuggle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/sep/16/guardian-android-app-faqs\">SD cards</a> in - you know, the tiny little SD cards, because everybody has a phone.  </p><p>They turn out to be incredibly cheap, incredibly standardised, and it's a great way to get information about what's really going on in the world to closed societies. Even if you don't have an internet connection, or your internet connection is too expensive, you could have an SD card which would have the information that I'm describing. And these SD cards are getting more and more powerful.  </p><p>People in the developing world are much more clever than we think because they have to work with what they're given. So they'll find a way to solve their information problem with the tools at hand, and this SD card is an example.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/privacy\">Privacy & the media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange\">Julian Assange</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones\">Mobile phones</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer\">Tablet computers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth.  Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core  idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace.  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example.  So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible.  </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO.  </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\"  </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave.  </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google.  </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet.  </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet.

The Czech Inn is five minutes' drive from the blast site and most of its 70 rooms are occupied by displaced, disheveled residents.</p><p>A wide area around the plant remained sealed off by police on Friday as frustration grew among those unable to return to their houses – or what remains of them.</p><p>Andrew Malinovsky said that his home about 11 blocks from the plant had largely escaped damage but that he was not permitted to get back to access his medicine. \"I'm a diabetic, disabled veteran. They won't even let me get to my house to get the essential stuff I need to live: medications, my breathing machine,\" he said in the hotel lobby.</p><p>Malinovsky was sitting in his living room when the plant exploded. \"It was like somebody went wham and slapped my whole body from front and back,\" he said.</p><p>Anissa Adamson was relieved that her son happened to be on an evening shift at the Czech Stop bakery and convenience store on Wednesday night. He lives next to the plant in an apartment complex that is now just a tattered metal skeleton. \"We're lucky, everyone in my family got out,\" she said. Most of her relatives live close to the plant but only one cousin required hospital treatment. Adamson herself moved out of her son's building less than three weeks ago.  </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday night at a packed church service for the victims near West's modest downtown, many wearing red and white jerseys bearing the logo of the town's beloved Trojans high school football team. The field was used as a triage center. \"Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere,\" Father Ed Karasek told mourners. T-shirts that say \"GOD BLESS WEST\" are now in fashion.</p><p>International media, charities, politicians and state and federal agencies are crowding a town that normally only expects to welcome large numbers of outsiders for its annual Czech heritage festival.</p><p>Even before the number of dead and their names have been formally confirmed, even while locals can only assess the destruction from gossip among neighbours and the apocalyptic footage being aired again and again on television news, life's practical necessities are imposing a framework on this crushed community, giving it structure amid the shock.</p><p>Roads are busy. Many shops are open. Spirited polka music was pumped out from the Village Bakery on to a sidewalk still littered with broken glass from shattered windows. Children need to go back to school on Monday – somewhere. An insurance company has set up a stall outside an antiques shop.</p><p>Another has parked a mobile crisis response unit at the main entrance to the town, the Stars and Stripes on its tall portable flagpole whipping from side to side in the heavy breeze.

The Czech Inn is five minutes' drive from the blast site and most of its 70 rooms are occupied by displaced, disheveled residents.</p><p>A wide area around the plant remained sealed off by police on Friday as frustration grew among those unable to return to their houses – or what remains of them.</p><p>Andrew Malinovsky said that his home about 11 blocks from the plant had largely escaped damage but that he was not permitted to get back to access his medicine. \"I'm a diabetic, disabled veteran. They won't even let me get to my house to get the essential stuff I need to live: medications, my breathing machine,\" he said in the hotel lobby.</p><p>Malinovsky was sitting in his living room when the plant exploded. \"It was like somebody went wham and slapped my whole body from front and back,\" he said.</p><p>Anissa Adamson was relieved that her son happened to be on an evening shift at the Czech Stop bakery and convenience store on Wednesday night. He lives next to the plant in an apartment complex that is now just a tattered metal skeleton. \"We're lucky, everyone in my family got out,\" she said. Most of her relatives live close to the plant but only one cousin required hospital treatment. Adamson herself moved out of her son's building less than three weeks ago.  </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday night at a packed church service for the victims near West's modest downtown, many wearing red and white jerseys bearing the logo of the town's beloved Trojans high school football team. The field was used as a triage center. \"Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere,\" Father Ed Karasek told mourners. T-shirts that say \"GOD BLESS WEST\" are now in fashion.</p><p>International media, charities, politicians and state and federal agencies are crowding a town that normally only expects to welcome large numbers of outsiders for its annual Czech heritage festival.</p><p>Even before the number of dead and their names have been formally confirmed, even while locals can only assess the destruction from gossip among neighbours and the apocalyptic footage being aired again and again on television news, life's practical necessities are imposing a framework on this crushed community, giving it structure amid the shock.</p><p>Roads are busy. Many shops are open. Spirited polka music was pumped out from the Village Bakery on to a sidewalk still littered with broken glass from shattered windows. Children need to go back to school on Monday – somewhere. An insurance company has set up a stall outside an antiques shop.</p><p>Another has parked a mobile crisis response unit at the main entrance to the town, the Stars and Stripes on its tall portable flagpole whipping from side to side in the heavy breeze. A Dallas-based law firm issued a press release saying it is \"investigating possible lawsuits\" – call now!</p><p>At the moment the town is still too traumatised to think about recriminations, still more interested in compassion than consequences. The cause of the disaster remained unclear Friday afternoon. Adamson said she did not blame them for anything. \"It's not their fault, I know those people.

No counter-terrorism plan could have prepared the city for the wild scenes that followed the publication of identifiable pictures of the two marathon bombers.

Other than to end what they started in a trail of home-made death, there appears to be no logic to their actions.</p><p>America has experience with self-motivated bombers and shooters – in Times Square and Fort Hood. But nothing could have prepared the law enforcement agencies for the sort of scenes they had to cope with yesterday: the greater urban area of Boston in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-lockdown-police-hunt-bombing-suspect\" title=\"\">virtual lockdown</a>, all public transport shut down, thousands of residents forced to flee their homes and busloads of heavily armed police moved into an ever more tightly drawn siege. Their only concern was to stop more people dying. It is difficult to see what else they could have done.</p><p>Everyone should pause before wrapping some larger political narrative around the brothers' actions. Their father and uncle are stunned, disowning the bombing and shooting, and calling it a dishonour on their ethnic Chechen family. Nothing new there. But coming from a diaspora created by two brutal wars that Russia launched to crush separatism, it is not easy to place what the brothers did in Boston this week in any intelligible campaign. Chechen jihadis have been surfacing in a variety of battlegrounds outside Chechnya, against western-backed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but alongside radical Sunni opposition forces in Aleppo in Syria.</p><p>While radical Muslim Chechen militants   have staged brutal terrorist attacks against theatres, trains, aeroplanes and the Moscow Metro, if it turns out the pair were radicalised by trips back to the North Caucasus, this would be the first time such tactics were used outside Russia. If this transpires to be the case, the marathon bombings should be anathema to all diaspora Chechens. They seek asylum from a barbaric regime in Grozny, whose leader has no qualms in ordering assassinations of his opponents abroad. They have no interest in bombing those who provide them with a new home.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But nothing could have prepared the law enforcement agencies for the sort of scenes they had to cope with yesterday: the greater urban area of Boston in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-lockdown-police-hunt-bombing-suspect\" title=\"\">virtual lockdown</a>, all public transport shut down, thousands of residents forced to flee their homes and busloads of heavily armed police moved into an ever more tightly drawn siege. Their only concern was to stop more people dying. It is difficult to see what else they could have done.</p><p>Everyone should pause before wrapping some larger political narrative around the brothers' actions. Their father and uncle are stunned, disowning the bombing and shooting, and calling it a dishonour on their ethnic Chechen family. Nothing new there. But coming from a diaspora created by two brutal wars that Russia launched to crush separatism, it is not easy to place what the brothers did in Boston this week in any intelligible campaign. Chechen jihadis have been surfacing in a variety of battlegrounds outside Chechnya, against western-backed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, but alongside radical Sunni opposition forces in Aleppo in Syria.</p><p>While radical Muslim Chechen militants   have staged brutal terrorist attacks against theatres, trains, aeroplanes and the Moscow Metro, if it turns out the pair were radicalised by trips back to the North Caucasus, this would be the first time such tactics were used outside Russia. If this transpires to be the case, the marathon bombings should be anathema to all diaspora Chechens. They seek asylum from a barbaric regime in Grozny, whose leader has no qualms in ordering assassinations of his opponents abroad. They have no interest in bombing those who provide them with a new home.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Although it appears that they never lived in Chechnya, which has spent much of the past two decades racked by war, they maintained close ties to its culture.</p><p>There are conflicting reports in regards to the birth places of the Tsarnaev brothers. Local police, cited in Kyrgyz media, suggest that both were born in Kyrgyzstan. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community, which developed after Josef Stalin expelled hundreds of thousands of Chechens around central Asia during the second world war.</p><p>Little is known of the brothers' time in Kyrgyzstan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tamerlan-tsarnaev-american-life-of-dead-boston-bomb-suspect\">who was shot dead by Boston police in the early hours of Friday morning</a>, was born in 1986. His younger brother, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-suspect-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-school\">19 and on the run</a>, was born in July 1993. The following year, Chechnya would break out into the first of two wars, as it fought to secede from Russia in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Moscow responded with unbridled brutality, being accused of widespread human rights abuses against the civilian population. The rebels in the mainly Muslim republic grew ever more Islamist.</p><p>The Tsarnaev family moved to Dagestan, a Muslim republic neighbouring Chechnya, sometime between 1999 and 2001. According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, the younger Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002.</p><p>The family appears to have settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But according to US law enforcement officials cited by the Wall Street Journal, the two brothers arrived separately: one with his parents in 2002, the other in 2004. The officials said that one or both of the brothers had returned to the Caucasus for some time after emigrating to the US.</p><p>Tamerlan is thought to have spent around six months of last year out of the US, during which time he saw his father in Dagestan. Anzor Tsarnaev told the New York Times that during the visit he and his son \"went to Chechnya to visit relatives\".</p><p>Authorities in Chechnya, in the midst of a massive campaign to show that life in the republic has normalised despite a continuing low-level insurgency, harshly denied any links to the brothers. \"Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if found guilty, is in vain,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tsarnaev-brothers-chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov\">the republic's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, wrote on Instagram on Friday</a>. \"They grew up in the US, their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America.\"</p><p>Yet the brothers left internet evidence that showed their deep ties to the republic. The last entry on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's page on VKontakte, posted on 19 March, shows a video of his brother humorously imitating various accents from the region, in fluent Russian. It shows that among the three groups to which he belongs are \"Chechen's\" and \"Chechnya: Everything about the Chechen Republic\".</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev's links run even deeper. A YouTube account that appears to have been run by the elder Tsarnaev includes a playlist devoted to Timur Mutsuraev, a Chechen singer now in exile who sang of the republic's battle for freedom from Russia. His account also includes a playlist devoted to \"terrorism\", including one video in English entitled \"The Emergence of Prophecy: The Black Flags from Khorasan\". He also maintained a playlist devoted to Islam.</p><p>Chechnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer Johannes Hirn, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010. One caption in the report reads: \"Unless his native Chechnya becomes independent, Tamerlan says he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia.\" The elder Tsarnaev fought for a while as a competitive boxer, taking time off from his studies at Bunker Hill community college in Charleston, Massachusetts.</p><p>The report also shows him to have been very religious, and poorly integrated in the US. According to Hirn's report, the Chechen once said: \"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.\" In 2009, Tsarnaev was reportedly arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. His aunt, who lives in Canada, told reporters on Friday that the elder brother had married and that the couple had a three-year-old daughter living in the US.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kyrgyzstan\">Kyrgyzstan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder\">Miriam Elder</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
