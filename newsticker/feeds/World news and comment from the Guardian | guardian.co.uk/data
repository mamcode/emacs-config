The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As it charts his journey from provincial joker to maverick statesman, Benvenuto Presidente! has given viewers some much needed laughs at a time when real-life politics is every bit as strange as fiction, but certainly not as funny.</p><p>On Thursday, seven weeks after elections that resulted in little more than unbreakable gridlock, more than 1,000 politicians are due to gather in the lower house of parliament to start the process of electing a new president to replace Giorgio Napolitano, the widely respected former communist who, at the age of 87, has come to the end of his seven-year term.</p><p>The choice of a new head of state is always important, but this time, as the clock ticks and there is still no new government, it is crucial. It will be up to Napolitano's successor to see whether bickering politicians can be cajoled into forming a government or whether a return to the polls is the only way forward. Even for those with rather more political experience than Peppino, the challenge is daunting.</p><p>\"This election is extremely important because the president of the republic is in office for seven long years without interruption,\" said Gianfranco Pasquino, a leftwing political scientist and former senator. \"He has the power first to appoint the prime minister and second to dissolve parliament, so he is a very powerful man, especially because the [political] parties are very weak and there is no majority for any party or any single coalition.\"</p><p>Although a largely symbolic office, the Italian presidency has been likened to a concertina that can expand and contract according to need. In the past year and a half that need has been greater than ever. When Silvio Berlusconi's government collapsed in November 2011 it was Napolitano who drafted in Mario Monti and invited the economist to form a technocratic government.</p><p>In the long and anguished aftermath of February's election, \"King George\", as he has been dubbed by the media, has once again played a central role. But, due to constitutional restrictions on the powers of a president in his final six months in office, he has not been able to dissolve parliament and call new elections. So all eyes will be on his successor – but quite who that will be remains unclear.</p><p>What is always an obscure process cloaked in intrigue has become even more so this year as the presidency becomes a bargaining chip in the battle for a government. Any candidate will need broad support; in the first three rounds a two-thirds majority is needed, while thereafter the requirement falls to a simple majority.</p><p>It had been hoped that, if a president were elected with the backing of both Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left and Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right, the path to some form of new government might potentially run more smoothly. But , as Bersani threw his support behind Franco Marini, a prominent Catholic in the Democratic party (PD) and former speaker of the senate, the supposed \"consensus\" candidate immediately appeared to expose the deep faultlines within his own party.</p><p>While backed by Berlusconi's bloc and Monti's centrists, Marini's candidacy was vehemently opposed by Bersani's chief leadership rival, Matteo Renzi, who had already slated Marini earlier in the week and who declared last night that his presidency would do a \"disservice\" to the country.</p><p>There was speculation that elements of the centre-left unhappy with Marini could back the candidate of Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment Five Star Movement, Stefano Rodotà, a leftwing professor of law. The M5S had originally backed investigative journalist, Milena Gabanelli, but she politely but firmly declined.</p><p>Francesco Clementi, a constitutional expert and professor of law at the University of Perugia, said the election – which is carried out by secret ballot – would be a gauge of the various divisions in the PD. \"This will be a very interesting, very strange election in which we will be able to check the influences within the party,\" he said.  Among the other names suggested as potential candidates have been Giuliano Amato, a respected former prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, who in 1998 became the first former Communist to become prime minister of a Nato country, and Sergio Mattarella, a former deputy prime minister under D'Alema who is now a judge in Italy's constitutional court. Former prime minister Romano Prodi, championed by many on the centre-left, was dismissed outright by Berlusconi, who lost two elections to him.All predictions are made with caution. Observers compare the presidential election to the papal conclave and say that, just as he who is dubbed the greatest <em>papabile</em> usually exits a cardinal, so frontrunners for the Quirinale palace tend not to emerge as president-elect. The process can also be as lengthy as a conclave: while two presidents have been chosen with lightening speed on the first ballot, it ran to 16 rounds in 1992 and 23 in 1971.</p><p>Many Italians are watching the election with scepticism. Near the Quirinale, Tonino Giardini, a consultant, said on Tuesday that none of the potential candidates inspired much faith. \"We don't have anyone on Napolitano's level,\" he said. \"I'm looking, but I can't see anyone.\"</p><p>Over coffee in a nearby bar, Paolo Ganino, a 27-year-old journalism student based in London, bemoaned the paralysis. \"We need a government. I came back from England to vote to have a government, and I still don't have it. I have the government that was appointed by the president and not voted by anyone that is still in charge,\" he laughed, bitterly. Will the new president, whoever he or she is, be able to change much? Ganino, a PD voter, was not hopeful, suspecting that fresh elections would be on the cards before the year's end. \"It's a very difficult situation. I'm really into politics,\" he said. \"But I do not see a way out.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy\">Italy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mario-monti\">Mario Monti</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italian-elections-2013\">Italian elections 2013</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizzydavies\">Lizzy Davies</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems.

In Liverpool, the radical bookshop News from Nowhere said party packs – containing black balloons and party poppers with the politician's face on and bearing the legend: \"Still hate Thatcher\" – sold out in two days.</p><p>In Scotland, trade unionists and socialists were due to hold a rally on Wednesday evening to remember the \"industries and communities who suffered\" under her government\".</p><p>In London, protest organisers had called for people to silently turn their back on Thatcher's coffin. But as it came into view at 10.45am, there were shouts of \"What a waste of money\" and \"Tory scum\". Similar shouts at other points on the route were drowned out by pro-Thatcher clapping.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/17/margaret-thatcher-funeral-turning-my-back\" title=\"\">Rebecca Lush Blum</a> from Hampshire, who set up a Facebook group to organise the protest event on the route at Ludgate Circus, said she was pleased people had been allowed to voice anger at Thatcher's legacy.</p><p>\"We have shown the world that not everyone in this country thinks Margaret Thatcher was a great thing for this country … today felt like an important moment in the battle over what her legacy is and what sort of country we want so I'm pleased our voice was heard.\"</p><p>Police had told Blum the protest could go ahead and by 9.30am about 100 people had gathered at the normally busy junction in central London. As the first ceremonial military band went past just before 10am, there were boos and chants from protesters. Thatcher supporters – including one man wearing a suit and Thatcher T-shirt on a balcony overlooking the crowd – clapped and cheered.</p><p>Numbers of protesters swelled and by the time the coffin went by, police at the scene estimated there were about 300 protesters. The atmosphere was tense, with military personnel gathered at the other side of the road, clapping and cheering.</p><p>Dave Winslow, 22, an anthropology student from Durham – who was holding a placard reading \"Rest of us in Poverty\" and wearing a T-shirt with the messages \"Power to the people\" and \"Society does exist\" – was one of those who wanted a silent protest.</p><p>\"We want to maintain a dignified protest,\" he said. \"It's counterproductive to catcall and sing Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead. The message is that spending £10m on such a divisive figure in times of austerity, especially when austerity is being imposed on the poor, is wrong, especially when harm is being caused to the disabled and the NHS.\"</p><p>There was a big police presence with \"liaison officers\" mingling with the crowd and armed police guarding the barriers along the route. Surveillance officers took up positions on surrounding buildings.</p><p>Once the coffin had passed, some protesters were visibly moved. One man, who did not want to give his name, had tears in his eyes. He said: \"She ruined my family's life. She took my dad's job, everything … I promised myself I would come here for this day years ago.\"</p><p>Julie Guest, who had been in Iraq in 1998, said she pledged she would come when she saw a six-year-old Iraqi boy die because sanctions had stopped him getting medical treatment.</p><p>\"The consequences of her policies have spread a long way in this country and abroad and I said to myself when I saw that boy die that I would remember him when this day came.\"</p><p>The funeral procession passed within a few minutes and the crowd began to disperse. Police confirmed there were no arrests.</p><p>Blum, who had been besieged by media since an article about her planned protest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/14/thatcher-funeral-protesters-police\" title=\"\">appeared in the Guardian on Monday</a>, said she was pleased and moved by what had happened.</p><p>\"It's provocative to have a state funeral for such a controversial politician, and I wanted to remember and respect all those who suffered under Margaret Thatcher. I think we did that today.\"</p><p>A few miles south of St Paul's Cathedral, a group of 19- to 25-year-olds were discussing her legacy at Kids Company, a charity based in south London. Outside, the traffic was perhaps more modest than usual but otherwise it felt like a normal day. \"If it was Tony Blair, it might mean more to people,\" said Amee, 20. Still, she said, we are living in the world Thatcher created. \"Because of what she did, our benefits are dropping. Average working people can't afford to have a mortgage. Soon everything is going to belong to private companies. I look at my three-year-old and wonder how I'm going to put him through school.\"</p><p>\"If I have any respect for her it's because she was a fierce leader,\" said Monique, 21. \"She was decisive and stuck to her beliefs. Most politicians today are wishy-washy but she kept her word.\" Amee added: \"She did a lot to affect the whole system and how it works. She is still in the system even though she is out of power; even though she is dead.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest\">Protest</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matthewtaylor\">Matthew Taylor</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullewis\">Paul Lewis</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil. Let's kill them all\" after the attacks, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslims-are-evil-lets-kill-them-all-us-tv-commentator-erik-rush-provokes-furious-reaction-with-boston-bombing-twitter-rants-8575176.html\">provoking a furious reaction on Twitter</a>. Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Witnesses told police the driver had warned them there was a problem, as the coach veered off the road and smashed into overhanging rocks. Some passengers escaped from the burning vehicle by breaking the windows and jumping out. The survivors were flown back to the UK on Wednesday on a specially chartered flight that left Grenoble airport at around 16.00 local time.</p><p>The driver, who worked for Classic Coaches, based in Country Durham, was transporting 53 people from the Alpine resort of Alpe d'Huez back to the UK. The steep and winding road, known as the Route Napoléon, links Cannes with Grenoble through the Alps. With its 21 bends it is often used as one of the stages of the celebrated Tour de France cycle race.</p><p>Jean Rampon, director of the local prefect's office, said: \"The bus was descending and the drive had the time to warn the passengers that he had a problem with the brakes. He hit the rocks and the bus caught fire.\"</p><p>Transport minister Frédéric Cuvillier visited the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening and praised the \"remarkable courage\" of the driver, whose action, he said, had \"saved many lives\". He said the position of the vehicle suggested the driver had tried to slow the vehicle down by hitting the rock rather than risking it veering off the road into a ravine.</p><p>\"The driver showed remarkable courage. The witnesses all agree that his acts and his attitude meant a much heavier loss of life was avoided,\" Cuvillier said.</p><p>The Grenoble public prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat said it appeared \"very probable that this was a problem with the brakes\".</p><p>\"Now the question is why and it will be a long inquiry,\" he told journalists.</p><p>Several hours after the accident, the burned-out coach could be seen hanging over the edge of the mountain road. Empty and charred suitcases along with clothes and personal belongings were scattered around.</p><p>The passengers were said to be \"seasonal ski workers\" aged around 25 returning to Britain after the resorts closed. Around 100,000 seasonal workers make the annual pilgrimage to the northern Alpine region.</p><p>\"When we arrived, people had got out (of the vehicle) by themselves,\" said one rescuer who said it was a scene of panic with passengers screaming and crying.</p><p>The driver was killed, and three other passengers seriously injured. A further 26 were described as slightly injured\". The remainder escaped unharmed. A woman who was seriously burned has been taken to the specialist burns unit at the Edouard Herriot hospital in the city of Lyon. The two other injured passengers are in the general hospital at Grenoble, one in intensive care and the other in a surgical ward.</p><p>In total, 80 firefighters in 30 vehicles and 45 gendarmes were mobilised.</p><p>The most serious recent coach accident in the Alps was in July 2007, when 26 Polish pilgrims were killed and 14 others injured when their vehicle crashed and caught fire in a ravine at Vizille in the Isere after leaving the road.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport\">Road transport</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france\">France</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kim-willsher\">Kim Willsher</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They include members of the New IRA's political wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement.</p><p>Several hundred people attended the party, with the police keeping a discreet distance from the crowds, the majority of whom were young men in their twenties and teens.</p><p>There have been outbreaks of rioting following previous Thatcher-death parties. But youth workers and residents on the Fountain estate said they were just praying the day of Thatcher's funeral would pass quickly.</p><p>Inside the Cathedral Youth Club, within sight of Derry's ancient walls, Graham Warke and Phillip Jackson said they were dreading Wednesday night, given earlier republican street celebrations. The district has come under attack for six nights in a row.</p><p>\"I just can't wait to get this day over with,\" Warke said. \"Residents here are dreading what will happen later.\"</p><p>Warke played video footage taken on his smartphone of six nights of violent attacks on the small estate. It included very young boys wearing hoodies and football scarves throwing petrol bombs over the city's walls and at police patrols.</p><p>Jackson said most people on the Fountain, a small district covered in union flags that is home to the last 400 Protestant residents on Derry's West Bank, were \"repulsed\" over the celebrations.</p><p>\"People on this estate and in all loyalist parts of Londonderry are asking 'how low can these people go by celebrating someone dying?'\"</p><p>Jackson claimed he saw older men orchestrating the rioting directed at his area. \"Those mocking Mrs Thatcher's death are behaving like animals; it is disgusting the way they get on,\" he added.</p><p>Amid all the hatred expressed against Thatcher, a man who personifies peace and non-violent resistance had arrived in the city.</p><p>The Dalai Lama had come to Derry ahead of a symbolic event leading a cross-community walk across Derry's new Peace Bridge over the river Foyle.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland\">Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/derry\">Derry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/northernireland\">Northern Irish politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dalailama\">Dalai Lama</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald\">Henry McDonald</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chinese bank ICBC ousted Exxon Mobil as the world's biggest company, according to the magazine's 10th annual ranking of the world's top 2,000 firms. China Construction Bank bumped JP Morgan out of the second spot.</p><p>The US had a total of 543 members in the list this year, 19 more firms than last year and the highest total since 2009.

Exxon, last year's No 1, slipped into fourth place this year behind the two Chinese firms, JP Morgan and General Electric. Apple eclipsed Exxon as the most valuable company by market capitalization last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/25/exxon-apple-most-valuable-stock\">and the two have vied for pole position ever since</a>. Apple slipped behind Exxon once more on Wednesday.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said. Simons said he expected Congress would have to address the imbalance and that the ruling was likely to lead to more not less litigation.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royaldutchshell\">Royal Dutch Shell</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy\">US foreign policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I intensely disliked the Ba'ath party and most of the ministers who formed the government then. So I have no bias towards the Ba'ath and the president who took over from his father. The trouble is that most of the reporting from Syria comes from sources stationed among the insurgents, who include, for example, the Jabhat al-Nusra, which has just declared its loyalty to al-Qaida, and extremist Sunnis opposed to the Alawites, the president's sect, and have anti-democratic and anti-western views. They don't enjoy support from minorities like the Christians and the Ismailis.</p><p>At last the Guardian has a man in Damascus and can report the regime's version.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/syrian-minister-uk-france-al-qaida?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> Ian Black</a> (15 April) is sensibly cautious. His account of the bombing which damaged the central bank clearly suggests that the bomb came from the insurgents; and more frankly he says that another bomb, killing 80 people, exploded near a Ba'ath headquarters and was blamed on Jabhat al-Nusra. Why our government can help the French to fight al-Qaida in Mali and simultaneously send assistance to its supporters in Syria is difficult to understand. We should be neutral and keep far away from the Syrian struggle.<br /><strong>James Craig</strong><br /><em>Standlake, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Much of your reporting on Syria could have been written by GW Bush: the same old rebels are good, the Syrian government is bad recipe. The Syrian reality seems a little simpler. Syria is crawling with foreign jihadists and it would be exceedingly naive to assume that the special forces of the countries supplying the weapons are not there also – France, the US, UK, various Arab despots?</p><p>Meanwhile, most Syrians in Syria want the killing to stop so they can live their lives without fear. They wanted a negotiated settlement from the Kofi Annan plan, but this was flagrantly obstructed and torpedoed by the west. For Syria read Libya.  <br /><strong>Khalid Mahmood-Chohan</strong><br /><em>Watford, Hertfordshire</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida\">al-Qaida</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Evidence released by the Venezuelan government includes an email sent from Armando Briquet, of Capriles's campaign team, to Guillermo Salas, of Esdata, which reports on Venezuela's electoral process, stating \"we need everything set out in Washington for checking over by the [Capriles campaign] (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/venezuela-opposition-protest-maduro-victory?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 17 April). It's necessary that all documentation is presented if we decide to take the road of not recognising the results\". Nicolas Maduro won Sunday's elections by 1.8%, 262,000 votes. Capriles only won the governorship of Miranda in December last year by 40,000 votes, and both sides accepted the results and the transparency of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council. Chávez lost the constitutional reform referendum in 2007 by a narrower margin, 1.4%, and accepted the result. With a turnout of just under 79%, the results mean 40% of the Venezuelan electorate voted for Maduro, more than Thatcher in 1979 (33%), Blair in 1997 (31%), Cameron in 2010 (23%), Obama in 2008 (30%) and Attlee in 1945 (36%).

There are a number of areas that urgently need to be addressed. First, how is it that none of these banking issues appear to have been identified by the auditors, in their \"going concern\" assessments. Is it reasonable to expect regulators to know more about what is going on inside an organisation than an auditor? Regulators can help protect consumer interests through pricing regulation but, if they are really involved with detailed internal process assessment, what are the auditors doing? Perhaps the auditing function should also have a formal responsibility to customers, as well as to shareholders.</p><p>Second, there is scope for a major investigation into how banks actually add value to society. In essence, the sectors' profits and bonuses are ultimately paid for by their customers.</p><p>Third, there is a need to investigate the extent to which \"selling\" is, almost by definition, unprofessional. The concept of being professional should mean that the interests of the customer/client come first. Where the seller operates within an incentive structure that benefits both the seller and others in their organisation, the net result will almost inevitably be defined as mis-selling.</p><p>The horrific consequences that have arisen in such areas as PPI etc, probably also apply to much of the pay-day loan industry, as well as a significant part of international lending. A major inquiry into the nature and future of the finance sector is long overdue, but there are also many important questions urgently in need of further research.<br /><strong>Emeritus professor Bruce Lloyd</strong><br /><em>South Bank University</em></p><p></p><p>• It is obvious many of the top executives of the failed banks had no actual financial expertise; they are like someone pretending to be a doctor, or a fake architect whose buildings collapse, guilty of misrepresentation. The regulator may be surprised no bank bosses have faced charges – we all are. <br /><strong>Tony Cheney</strong><br /><em>Ipswich, Suffolk </em></p><p></p><p>• As a research and advocacy group that has for years called attention to the murky world of tax havens, we welcome your report (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/03/offshore-secrets-offshore-tax-haven?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Leaks reveal secrets of the rich who hide cash offshore</a>, 4 April). But you should also have dispelled the myth advocated by some proponents that tax havens promote greater tax efficiency through competition; the evidence in economic literature is scanty at best. What is clear is that this benefit has not been enough to prevent tax havens from going bankrupt.</p><p>In September 2009, the Cayman Islands, one of the largest, faced bankruptcy and was unable to pay its government employees. Britain, which oversees the territory, was forced to bail out the Cayman authorities. Recently, Cyprus went belly up and had to be rescued by the EU, ECB, and IMF.</p><p>Investors need to realise that the lack of prudential regulations and oversight allows tax havens to pass on the cost-savings to them as higher returns. But with higher returns come higher risks. They implicitly accepted those risks when they invested in tax havens. In the event the financial risks pile up – as they inevitably must – and the house of cards comes crashing down, investors should not expect taxpayers to foot the bill. <br /><strong>Dev Kar</strong><br /><em>Lead economist, </em><a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Financial Integrity</em></a><em>, Washington DC</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking\">Banking</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/caymanislands\">Cayman Islands</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus\">Cyprus</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The sun is out and, despite the blasting wind, the bite in the air has departed. After a delay of a month the energy is now bursting out and Titchmarsh Wood is springing into life. Among the small oaks, blossoming sallow and hazel coppice, great tits, chiffchaffs, bullfinches, redpoll, and many other small birds urgently broadcast their individual churrs, cheeps and twitters. The recent weather must have been immensely trying for the resident birds; many will have perished as they struggled to maintain body heat on intermittent invertebrate food supplies. The survivors, joined by recent arrivals from transcontinental travels, sound like they are making up for lost time.</p><p>Splashes of primroses colour the verges but the trees are still in bud. Only the most sheltered blackthorn bushes are in bud burst; blossom and leaves breaking out at the same moment. The bluebells and patches of wild garlic are in leaf but nowhere near being in flower. For weeks I have been scanning for brimstone butterflies, the little fluttering yellow flags that would signal the end of the reign of white. Today the brimstones are out, careering up and down the rides. Peacocks and small tortoiseshells are also active, some feeding on yellow puffs of sallow blossom. Portly queen bumblebees pipe up sallow nectar and burn off the sugar flying low over the ground, hunting for suitable small mammal burrows in which to establish their nests. The insects are back, the numbers are perhaps low, but after their long hibernation it is good to see and hear them again.</p><p>The ground is waterlogged and the path churned; overhead are the plaintive cries of a pair of buzzards and a pair of red kites. The soaring, diving and banking birds of prey wheel in the sky as if acting out an aerial dogfight. As with the finches, warblers and tits, the race is on to secure the choicest nesting spots and feeding territories. The lines for another breeding season are being drawn.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs\">Rural affairs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/birds\">Birds</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/animals\">Animals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/insects\">Insects</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-shardlow\">Matt Shardlow</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Still, academics and journalists need each other</p><p>It's a good thing the BBC did not send its undercover reporter to North Korea with a group of students from Oxford University. Otherwise Oxford's chancellor, Chris Patten, would have had to send a strongly worded letter of protest to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Chris Patten. \"I cannot understand how you could allow …\"</p><p>I refer, of course, to the row about journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/why-is-lse-making-fuss-over-panorama\" title=\"\">John Sweeney travelling to North Korea</a> with a group of students from the London School of Economics on undercover assignment for the BBC's Panorama. Compared with working out if there is a real threat of nuclear war from the world's last full-dress totalitarian state, this may seem like a storm in a British teacup. But it prompts us to reflect on how we can discover what nasty, secretive regimes are up to, without sacrificing our own values and endangering others along the way.</p><p>As someone who has spent a good chunk of his life trying to do just that, in&nbsp;journalism and in academia, I've been&nbsp;interested in responses on both sides of the academia-journalism fence. I start from a strong sympathy with the undercover reporter. We owe no duty of&nbsp;honesty to tyrants. There is nothing to compare with being there, on the spot. The first article I ever published was a report based on joining a \"Progressive Tour\" to Albania, then suffering under a totalitarian regime with a strong resemblance to today's North Korea. If Sweeney had embedded himself in one of the tours that travel regularly to North Korea, as other journalists have, he would deserve only praise. But he didn't, and no one comes out of this story very well.</p><p>The LSE had legitimate grounds for concern. It seems that a few of those on the trip had not been told about their journalistic accompaniment. The&nbsp;students subsequently received bullying emails from a North Korean official, threatening to publish their \"personal data\" because they had broken North Korean law. If any of them&nbsp;wanted to pursue an academic career in North Korean studies, this would not be a good start. But the LSE's highly public reaction was over the top, and arguably counterproductive.</p><p>The BBC's expert prior assessment, which concluded that the students risked at most brief detention and expulsion, was probably about right. The LSE made virtually no acknowledgement of the genuine public interest in such a journalistic investigation. Its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9994533/LSE-BBCs-Panorama-decision-extremely-regrettable.html\" title=\"\">call for the programme not to be broadcast</a> at all was ridiculous. Its thermonuclear response must draw the attention of every authoritarian regime to the journalistic worm that might be hidden in any LSE study group. A strong private protest to the BBC would have been best.</p><p>The BBC exhibited that proclivity for weak and contorted compromise that seems to be a hallmark of its recent management. If it had got written, informed consent from everyone on the trip, as its own editorial guidelines suggest, then no reasonable person could have complained. \"Students are adults, after all,\" as a former head of Oxford's department of politics and international relations exclaimed. Instead, most of them seem to have been partially informed, apparently in individual conversations with the reporter's wife (an LSE alumna, who was organising the trip) and the cameraman. But even those students were not fully&nbsp;informed – for their own protection, BBC managers said.</p><p>This is inconsistent and silly. It's the&nbsp;same <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/bbc-caves-thatcher-song-ding-dong\" title=\"\">muddled management style which led to only a tiny clip</a> from Ding&nbsp;Dong! The Witch is Dead, virally&nbsp;promoted online as a posthumous insult to Margaret Thatcher, being&nbsp;played on Radio 1's chart show, together with a spoken explanation of the background. For God's sake, Auntie, make up your mind. Either play the bloody song or don't. Either get the students' consent or don't.</p><p>As for Sweeney Agonistes, one can see why the fact that his wife was organising this trip for an LSE student society was tempting. But a whizz around the BBC website reveals a story posted just five days before the Panorama broadcast, explaining the possibilities of tourism to North Korea. One satisfied customer describes himself as an \"adventure tourist\". An expert on Pyongyang's nuclear programme tells me that when he spoke at a foreign correspondents' club in London, half the journalists in the room seemed to have visited North Korea on such tours.</p><p>Moreover, the value added by the Panorama programme did not match its hype. It was interesting to see what foreigners are shown – a chilly model hospital with no patients, for example – and a few blurry glimpses of what they are not shown: the miserable poor, squatting in ditches. But most of the real insights came from experts and defectors interviewed outside the country. \"So, welcome to the real North Korea\" declared Sweeney dramatically, standing inside a barbed wire fence apparently built to keep ordinary people away from his tour group's hotel. Cut to a long-distance shot of some miserable-looking apartment buildings. But he wasn't in the real North Korea; he was in a Potemkin village inn. Back in downtown Pyongyang, he teetered over the edge into self-parody, intoning \"something's going on … you can feel the tension rising. The problem is, it's impossible for us to ask what's really happening. We don't know.\"</p><p>Contrast this with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/15/nothing-to-envy-barbara-demick\" title=\"\">Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy</a>, which carefully and movingly tells the personal stories of six North Koreans, based on extensive interviews and all other available sources. Demick, a journalist with a decade's experience in the region, makes extensive acknowledgement to fellow correspondents, academics and experts of all kinds. The result is a fantastic book, which gives us some of the truth that North Korea's progressive tour guides are paid to hide. Moral of the story? It's precisely in those secretive, nasty places that real knowledge only comes from years of hard work by journalists and academics alike, sharing the fruits of their complementary crafts.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timothygartonash\">Timothy Garton Ash</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There will be road-blocks everywhere.\"</p><p>But pro-democracy protesters opposed to Sunday's race have also been frustrated by increased security measures which have driven them out of the capital, Manama. Shehabi said: \"There was a blanket ban on all protests after last year's grand prix. People have been forced underground now. Protesters have been pushed to parts of small villages where they can't be heard or seen. As long as you're not seen or heard by anyone it's OK.</p><p>\"There is a continuation of government repression. We haven't seen justice or accountability for the F1 staff who were sacked and arrested and tortured in 2011. They were tortured at the circuit itself.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Jean Todt, president of the FIA, Formula One's governing body, has at last broken his silence in a letter to local NGOs concerning the Bahrain Grand Prix. In it, he said: \"It is our firm belief that sport, and the F1 grand prix, can have a positive and healing effect in situations where conflict, social unrest and tensions are causing distress.\"</p><p>Shehabi said: \"We have asked for 200 tickets for the race so protesters can make their point peacefully. But we won't be allowed within a mile of the circuit.\"</p><p>Said Yousif, spokesman for the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, said: \"There has been a government crackdown here and it started two weeks ago, especially in the villages close to the F1 track, and 65 people have been arrested.  Leaders have been beaten and tortured before being released, so everyone can see the marks of beating and torture. Houses have been razed in different villages. Tear gas has been used at close range. No one has died, as happened last year, but the crackdown has continued. I was in jail for a month three months ago just because I tweeted an injury in the capital.\"</p><p>Sheikh Ali Salman, leader of the Shia Muslim-led group al-Wefaq, has asked for an increase in peaceful protests. \"I am calling for more peaceful protests,\" he said. \"I am calling on people to share peaceful protests to send a message to the world about our demand for peaceful democratic reform. I am against violence. Our protest is to take place today, tomorrow and on Friday. It is not against the race itself.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formula-one-2013\">Formula One 2013</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bahrain\">Bahrain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/motorsports\">Motor sport</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulweaver\">Paul Weaver</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination,\" he told a local television channel after the discovery of the bodies of Mike and Cynthia McLelland at their home in a town east of Dallas on 30 March. They had been shot multiple times. Williams wished the police luck. \"I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act,\" he said.</p><p>The authorities now think they have the culprits. In the early hours of Wednesday, Williams' wife, Kim, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/texas-da-murders-justice-wife-arrested\">was arrested and charged with the murders of the McLellands and another prosecutor, Mark Hasse, in January</a>. According to her arrest warrant, she identified her husband as the shooter. He was already in the Kaufman County jail on a $3m bond, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/13/texas-da-murder-arrest-threat\">accused of sending an anonymous email containing a \"terroristic threat\"</a>.</p><p>Investigators had met Eric Williams in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant near his home in Kaufman, taken his cellphone and swabbed his hands to test for gun residue. His then-attorney repeatedly maintained that <a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/04/03/i-team-former-kaufman-co-official-talks-about-his-involvement-in-da-murder-cases/\">the disgraced former justice of the peace had nothing to do with the killings and was co-operating with police</a>.</p><p>But at a brief media conference on Wednesday afternoon, police released an affidavit alleging that Kim Williams had confessed to the murders and had implicated her husband. She was arrested and charged with capital murder, which potentially carries the death penalty. The 46-year-old is being held on a $10m bond.</p><p>\"Out of respect for the families of the victims, during this time, we are not answering any questions at this briefing until we're able to brief the family on the events of the past several days,\" Justin Lewis, a Kaufman County sheriff's department spokesman, told reporters.</p><p>In the absence of a firm suspect in the days following the deaths of the McLellands, who were both in their 60s, speculation had swirled that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/01/white-supremacist-group-linked-texas-da\">a prison gang such as the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas or a Mexican drug cartel might be responsible</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/04/colorado-texas-gang-white-supremacists\">The Texas governor, Rick Perry, arrived on the scene to announce a $200,000 reward for key information</a> and used an interview with Fox News to raise the issue of border security.</p><p><br />With no one claiming responsibility and officials apparently struggling for leads, tension was thick in Kaufman County, a large rural area about a half-hour drive south-east of Dallas. The McLellands' memorial (above) and funeral services took place amid an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, with a vast police presence including snipers on the roof of the church that held the memorial.</p><p>Now, if the authorities are proved right, the killings may have been prompted by something as simple as a feud between small-town political rivals that spiraled far out of control.</p><p>Beneath the dramatic and alarming talk of powerful and brutal international gangs bringing lethal force to a quiet community, there had been isolated hints of resentment towards McLelland's bombastic brand of law enforcement. On 5 April, the day that the McLellands were buried, a Kaufman County man was arrested and charged with making a threat on Facebook. The post allegedly said that another district attorney \"will soon perish\" and that staff in McLelland's office were not interested in \"actual guilt or innocence\" and were \"reaping what they have sown\". It followed the unconnected arrest earlier that week of another local man, who allegedly made threats against a Kaufman County official via a Crimestoppers hotline. <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/05/4752787/second-man-accused-of-making-threats.html\">Neither was a murder suspect</a>.</p><p>McLelland and Hasse prosecuted Eric Williams on charges of stealing three computer monitors from an office building in 2011. In December that year, Williams' lawyer tried unsuccessfully to remove McLelland and his staff from the case, claiming that the district attorney felt personal animosity towards Williams, stemming from an advertisement critical of McLelland that had run in local newspapers in 2006. That year, McLelland unsuccessfully ran for election as district attorney. He won the vote in 2010 and set about building a reputation as <a href=\"http://www.kaufmanherald.com/news/article_2775d76b-e0b2-5041-bb3c-84cd1365654f.html\">a hardliner who would destroy \"the good ol' boy network\"</a>.</p><p>During the trial, the prosecutors depicted Williams, above, as a violent, untrustworthy man. He was found guilty by a jury in March 2012, received two years' probation and lost his law license and his job as an elected justice of the peace. He was in the process of appealing the verdict when the McLellands died. Last week, Kim Williams told the Dallas Morning News that the couple have chronic health problems, no longer have health insurance and have been under financial stress.</p><p>Hasse, an assistant district attorney, was shot dead one block from the Kaufman County courthouse, on his way to work on 31 January. Standing outside the courthouse in his favorite wide-brimmed black cowboy hat, McLelland told reporters in a press conference that he would find the \"scum\" responsible.</p><p>The murders prompted speculation that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas may have carried out the crimes in retaliation for the prosecutors' involvement in a racketeering case brought in Houston last year against more than 30 gang members. In response to the killings in Forney, 21 miles from downtown Dallas, police stepped up protection for prosecutors across the state and one attorney withdrew from the racketeering case, apparently over security concerns.</p><p>Eric Williams has not been publicly named as a suspect by officials or been charged in connection with the deaths. But the 46-year-old allegedly emailed an anonymous threat to officers a day after the McLellands were found dead. According to the sheriff's office, the email suggested that if certain demands were not met, there would be another attack.</p><p>Towards the end of last week, the investigation seemed to be focusing more narrowly on Eric and Kim Williams. One official told the Associated Press that Eric Williams had a storage locker containing at least 20 weapons and that a Ford Crown Victoria car similar to one spotted in the McLellands' neighborhood on the day they died was also found at the facility in Seagoville, 15 miles west of Williams' home.</p><p>Today's affidavit states: \"Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office … both Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland regularly carried handguns after the Eric Williams jury trial because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-dart\">Tom Dart</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The LSE's public criticism sharpened after Tony Hall, the BBC director general, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/14/bbc-north-korea-panorama-film\" title=\"\">flatly rejected</a> the university's demands not to broadcast the film. Sweeney's Panorama aired as planned on BBC1 on Monday night.</p><p>The dispute is over whether the BBC had given the 10 students on the Pyongyang trip enough information about the risks of travelling with undercover journalists.</p><p>In the statement released on Wednesday night, six students backed the BBC and said they had no objection to the Panorama broadcast.</p><p>They said: \"When the story broke to the international media in response to a complaint about the trip, not all of us were consulted by the LSE, or their representatives, for our own accounts. Some of us have still not been consulted. We therefore feel compelled to establish the basic facts of the case, many of which have been distorted in the media, in this joint statement.\"</p><p>The students said they were told in London that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if they were rumbled. In Beijing, before they flew to Pyongyang, they were informed that Sweeney was the journalist and that he worked for the BBC, they said. They were also joined by Sweeney's wife, Tomiko Newson, who organised the trip, and a BBC cameraman.</p><p>Sweeney's Panorama film, North Korea Undercover, has been the subject of 348 complaints to the BBC since the public row broke out. Of these, about 150 were made before the documentary was broadcast.</p><p>The media regulator Ofcom has received fewer than 10 complaints.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josh-halliday\">Josh Halliday</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/2011-request-for-information-on-tamerlan-tsarnaev-from-foreign-government\">FBI said</a> that it did not find any \"terrorism activity\" and appears not to have had any further contact with him since.</p><p>FBI agents were scrambling to review a six-month visit to Russia by 26-year-old Tsarnaev last year, during which he stayed with his father in Dagestan and is reported to have visited the family's ethnic home of Chechnya.</p><p>In Boston, special agents trained in the interrogation of high-value suspects were waiting to question the surviving 19-year-old suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who remained in a serious condition in hospital on Saturday.</p><p>He was brought late on Friday night to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center – the same hospital where earlier in the day his brother Tamerlan died after a shootout with police. The Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick said on Saturday that Dzhokhar was in a serious but stable condition and was \"not able to communicate yet\".</p><p>As questions were raised about how well known the brothers were to federal investigators, their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, said that the FBI had spoken to the family on multiple occasions. In an interview broadcast by <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-brothers-parents-innocent-124/\">Russia Today</a> before the end of the manhunt on Friday, Tsarnaeva, a naturalised US citizen, said FBI agents had spoken to her in the past.</p><p>\"They were telling me that Tamerlan was really an extremist leader and they were afraid of him. They told me whatever information he is getting, he gets from these extremists' sites.\" Tsarnaeva, speaking from Dagestan, claimed that the FBI were monitoring her son \"at every step\", and had been \"controlling\" him for three to five years. She did not give specific dates.</p><p>The White House said Barack Obama had spoken to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as the manhunt came to an end on Friday. \"President Putin expressed his condolences on behalf of the Russian people for the tragic loss of life in Boston,\" the White House said in a statement.</p><p>Obama \"praised the close co-operation that the United States has received from Russia on counterterrorism, including in the wake of the Boston attack,\" the White House said.</p><h2>'Off the hook'</h2><p>But there were concerns in Congress that the FBI appeared not to have maintained contact with Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Representative Peter King of New York, a Republican member of the House homeland security committee, asked whether the FBI could have done more. \"Did they move too quickly by letting this guy off the hook?\" said King, <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/rep-peter-king-questions-fbi-s-2011-investigation-of-tamerlan-tsarnaev-1.5110152\">quoted in Newsday</a>. \"Should they have looked more carefully?\"</p><p>With a week-long manhunt for the suspects now over, and Boston getting back to normal following a virtual lockdown of the city on Friday, questions were also being raised about the approach of federal prosecutors to the surviving suspect. </p><p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any confession would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger. The exception would allow investigators to question Tsarnaev about possible accomplices or networks that might have conspired in the attacks.</p><p>Republican senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain supported the decision not to read Tsarnaev his Miranda rights, and called for him to be classified as an \"enemy combatant\".</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and civil rights advocates expressed concern about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\". </p><p>US prosecutors are considering how best to press charges against Tsarnaev, given his medical condition. They might wait for him to recover sufficiently to be taken to the federal courthouse in south Boston, or they might even request a federal judge comes to the hospital to charge him at the bedside. US officials said a special interrogation unit specialised in dealing with high-value suspects were waiting to question him.</p><p>On Friday the FBI took two men and a woman in New Bedford, Massachusetts, into custody and are questioning them about their links to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</p><p>The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it has agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, told the Associated Press that he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are \"serious issues regarding possible interrogation.\"</p><p>Once federal investigators are allowed access to Tsarnaev, they will be keen to quiz him on his connections – in the US, in Dagestan, where his father lives, and Chechnya, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev is thought to have visited last year. </p><p>Much of the investigation is likely to focus on the activities of the elder brother. The FBI has revealed that in 2011 Tamerlan was interviewed by its agents at the request of an unnamed foreign government – widely assumed to have been Russia – who asked the bureau to look into whether Tamerlan, then 24, had extremist connections.</p><p>In a statement, the FBI said that the foreign government had information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a \"follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups\".</p><h2>No evidence of terrorism</h2><p>In response to the request, the FBI scoured Tamerlan Tsarnaev's telephone records, online history, associations with other people, movements and educational history, and agents interviewed him and his relatives. But the bureau found no evidence of terrorism activity either at home or abroad. It passed on its findings to the foreign government.</p><p>According to US travel records, Tsarnaev arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on 12 January 2012, returning on 17 July. He spent time in Makhachkala, Dagestan, that summer. \"It was 40C and he was wearing these American boots,\" said Larissa Abakarova, who maintains a shop across the street from the home of the parents of Tsarnaev. \"He was stylish, kind, good-looking.

The <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/2011-request-for-information-on-tamerlan-tsarnaev-from-foreign-government\">FBI said</a> that it did not find any \"terrorism activity\" and appears not to have had any further contact with him since.</p><p>FBI agents were scrambling to review a six-month visit to Russia by 26-year-old Tsarnaev last year, during which he stayed with his father in Dagestan and is reported to have visited the family's ethnic home of Chechnya.</p><p>In Boston, special agents trained in the interrogation of high-value suspects were waiting to question the surviving 19-year-old suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who remained in a serious condition in hospital on Saturday.</p><p>He was brought late on Friday night to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center – the same hospital where earlier in the day his brother Tamerlan died after a shootout with police. The Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick said on Saturday that Dzhokhar was in a serious but stable condition and was \"not able to communicate yet\".</p><p>As questions were raised about how well known the brothers were to federal investigators, their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, said that the FBI had spoken to the family on multiple occasions. In an interview broadcast by <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-brothers-parents-innocent-124/\">Russia Today</a> before the end of the manhunt on Friday, Tsarnaeva, a naturalised US citizen, said FBI agents had spoken to her in the past.</p><p>\"They were telling me that Tamerlan was really an extremist leader and they were afraid of him. They told me whatever information he is getting, he gets from these extremists' sites.\" Tsarnaeva, speaking from Dagestan, claimed that the FBI were monitoring her son \"at every step\", and had been \"controlling\" him for three to five years. She did not give specific dates.</p><p>The White House said Barack Obama had spoken to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as the manhunt came to an end on Friday. \"President Putin expressed his condolences on behalf of the Russian people for the tragic loss of life in Boston,\" the White House said in a statement.</p><p>Obama \"praised the close co-operation that the United States has received from Russia on counterterrorism, including in the wake of the Boston attack,\" the White House said.</p><h2>'Off the hook'</h2><p>But there were concerns in Congress that the FBI appeared not to have maintained contact with Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Representative Peter King of New York, a Republican member of the House homeland security committee, asked whether the FBI could have done more. \"Did they move too quickly by letting this guy off the hook?\" said King, <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/rep-peter-king-questions-fbi-s-2011-investigation-of-tamerlan-tsarnaev-1.5110152\">quoted in Newsday</a>. \"Should they have looked more carefully?\"</p><p>With a week-long manhunt for the suspects now over, and Boston getting back to normal following a virtual lockdown of the city on Friday, questions were also being raised about the approach of federal prosecutors to the surviving suspect. </p><p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any confession would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger. The exception would allow investigators to question Tsarnaev about possible accomplices or networks that might have conspired in the attacks.</p><p>Republican senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain supported the decision not to read Tsarnaev his Miranda rights, and called for him to be classified as an \"enemy combatant\".</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and civil rights advocates expressed concern about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\". </p><p>US prosecutors are considering how best to press charges against Tsarnaev, given his medical condition. They might wait for him to recover sufficiently to be taken to the federal courthouse in south Boston, or they might even request a federal judge comes to the hospital to charge him at the bedside. US officials said a special interrogation unit specialised in dealing with high-value suspects were waiting to question him.</p><p>On Friday the FBI took two men and a woman in New Bedford, Massachusetts, into custody and are questioning them about their links to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.</p><p>The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it has agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, told the Associated Press that he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are \"serious issues regarding possible interrogation.\"</p><p>Once federal investigators are allowed access to Tsarnaev, they will be keen to quiz him on his connections – in the US, in Dagestan, where his father lives, and Chechnya, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev is thought to have visited last year. </p><p>Much of the investigation is likely to focus on the activities of the elder brother. The FBI has revealed that in 2011 Tamerlan was interviewed by its agents at the request of an unnamed foreign government – widely assumed to have been Russia – who asked the bureau to look into whether Tamerlan, then 24, had extremist connections.</p><p>In a statement, the FBI said that the foreign government had information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a \"follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups\".</p><h2>No evidence of terrorism</h2><p>In response to the request, the FBI scoured Tamerlan Tsarnaev's telephone records, online history, associations with other people, movements and educational history, and agents interviewed him and his relatives. But the bureau found no evidence of terrorism activity either at home or abroad. It passed on its findings to the foreign government.</p><p>According to US travel records, Tsarnaev arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on 12 January 2012, returning on 17 July. He spent time in Makhachkala, Dagestan, that summer. \"It was 40C and he was wearing these American boots,\" said Larissa Abakarova, who maintains a shop across the street from the home of the parents of Tsarnaev. \"He was stylish, kind, good-looking. I'm in shock.\"</p><p>A neighbour, Vyacheslav Kazakevich, said the Tsarnaevs' parents would travel regularly between the neighbouring republics of Dagestan and Chechnya, where several relatives live, including an aunt. He said that Tamerlan visited Chechnya, just an hour's drive from Makhachkala, during his trip to Russia in early 2012. \"All their roots are there.

Kristensen said the tail kit would give it a new mission and new capabilities, once some of the upgraded weapons were deployed as scheduled in Europe in 2019 or 2020.</p><p></p><p>\"What will be going back to Europe will be a guided nuclear bomb,\" he said. \"Especially when you combine it with F35 with stealth characteristics, that expands the targets you can hold at risk from Europe, because by placing the explosion closer to the target you can choose a lower explosive yield. That is very important as there is less radioactive fallout. For many people this is a great concern because it means making nuclear weapons more 'usable'.\"</p><p></p><p>The new B61 Mk12 will be a 50 kilotonne weapon, like most of the \"tactical\" nuclear bombs currently in Europe. The bigger, strategic versions of the B61,  stockpiled in the US, would be discontinued. Some European countries, led by Germany, have attempted to get the American B61 bombs withdrawn from Europe on the grounds they serve no military purpose following the end of the cold war and that they represent a security risk because of the possibility of their theft by terrorists. But some eastern European states have resisted their withdrawal, fearing  it would show a weakening of US commitment to defend them against Russia.</p><p></p><p>US administration officials say the addition of tail fins to the bomb does not represent a significant change in its mission and therefore does not break the 2010 pledge. They insist that Obama remains committed to the disarmament agenda he outlined in a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered\" title=\"\">2009 landmark speech</a> in Prague, in which he promised to work towards a world free of nuclear weapons.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the US signed the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/t/avc/newstart/index.htm\" title=\"\">new Start treaty with Russia</a>, limiting both sides' strategic arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads each. This spring, Obama was expected to make a  speech outlining proposals to make further cuts to about 1,100 warheads. But US officials have said the crisis over North Korea and the time needed to install a second-term national security team have delayed the speech.</p><p></p><p>Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, went to Moscow earlier this month to deliver a message from the president to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which included proposals to cut the two countries' nuclear arsenals and finding a compromise in the long-running dispute over US plans for a missile defence system in Europe. Sources familiar with the talks described the Russian response as  positive. Obama and Putin are to meet at the G8 meeting at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in June, but it is unclear whether the new nuclear weapons cuts will be ready by then.</p><p></p><p>Joseph Cirincione, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control pressure group, said  the B61 modernisation plans were largely driven by domestic political considerations but risked sending mixed messages to Russia at a time when Washington and Moscow needed to strike a deal.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm convinced the president wants to the continue his efforts to reform US nuclear policy,\" Cirincione said. \"But the administration had a schizoid approach on this issue. They believe they have to buy off legislators with billions of dollars in expenditure in their states in order to get votes for arms control measures later.</p><p></p><p>\"The billions of dollars we are lavishing on the B61 is criminal.

Kristensen said the tail kit would give it a new mission and new capabilities, once some of the upgraded weapons were deployed as scheduled in Europe in 2019 or 2020.</p><p></p><p>\"What will be going back to Europe will be a guided nuclear bomb,\" he said. \"Especially when you combine it with F35 with stealth characteristics, that expands the targets you can hold at risk from Europe, because by placing the explosion closer to the target you can choose a lower explosive yield. That is very important as there is less radioactive fallout. For many people this is a great concern because it means making nuclear weapons more 'usable'.\"</p><p></p><p>The new B61 Mk12 will be a 50 kilotonne weapon, like most of the \"tactical\" nuclear bombs currently in Europe. The bigger, strategic versions of the B61,  stockpiled in the US, would be discontinued. Some European countries, led by Germany, have attempted to get the American B61 bombs withdrawn from Europe on the grounds they serve no military purpose following the end of the cold war and that they represent a security risk because of the possibility of their theft by terrorists. But some eastern European states have resisted their withdrawal, fearing  it would show a weakening of US commitment to defend them against Russia.</p><p></p><p>US administration officials say the addition of tail fins to the bomb does not represent a significant change in its mission and therefore does not break the 2010 pledge. They insist that Obama remains committed to the disarmament agenda he outlined in a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered\" title=\"\">2009 landmark speech</a> in Prague, in which he promised to work towards a world free of nuclear weapons.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the US signed the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/t/avc/newstart/index.htm\" title=\"\">new Start treaty with Russia</a>, limiting both sides' strategic arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads each. This spring, Obama was expected to make a  speech outlining proposals to make further cuts to about 1,100 warheads. But US officials have said the crisis over North Korea and the time needed to install a second-term national security team have delayed the speech.</p><p></p><p>Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, went to Moscow earlier this month to deliver a message from the president to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which included proposals to cut the two countries' nuclear arsenals and finding a compromise in the long-running dispute over US plans for a missile defence system in Europe. Sources familiar with the talks described the Russian response as  positive. Obama and Putin are to meet at the G8 meeting at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland in June, but it is unclear whether the new nuclear weapons cuts will be ready by then.</p><p></p><p>Joseph Cirincione, the president of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control pressure group, said  the B61 modernisation plans were largely driven by domestic political considerations but risked sending mixed messages to Russia at a time when Washington and Moscow needed to strike a deal.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm convinced the president wants to the continue his efforts to reform US nuclear policy,\" Cirincione said. \"But the administration had a schizoid approach on this issue. They believe they have to buy off legislators with billions of dollars in expenditure in their states in order to get votes for arms control measures later.</p><p></p><p>\"The billions of dollars we are lavishing on the B61 is criminal. This is billions of dollars spent on a weapon whose mission evaporated at the end of the cold war. It's clearly aimed at buying senators' votes.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nuclear-weapons\">Nuclear weapons</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy\">US foreign policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military\">US military</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/julianborger\">Julian Borger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The capture came at the end of a tense Friday that began with the death of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, in a gun battle with police.</p><p>US officials said an elite interrogation team would question the Massachusetts college student without reading him his Miranda rights, something that is allowed on a limited basis when the public may be in immediate danger, such as instances in which it is feared bombs are planted and ready to be detonated.</p><p>The ACLU executive director, Anthony Romero, said the legal exception applied only when there was a continued threat to public safety and was \"not an open-ended exception\" to the Miranda rule, which guarantees the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.</p><p>The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it had agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, said he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there were \"serious issues regarding possible interrogation\".</p><p>There was no immediate word on when Tsarnaev might be charged and what those charges would be. The twin bombings in Boston last Monday killed three people and wounded more than 180.</p><p>The most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.</p><p>President Barack Obama said there were many unanswered questions about the bombings, including whether the Tsarnaev brothers – ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who had been in the US for about a decade and lived in the Boston area – had help from others. The president urged people not to rush into judgment about their motivations.</p><p>The Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, said on Saturday that Tsarnaev remained in a serious but stable condition and was probably unable to communicate. Tsarnaev was admitted to Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where 11 victims of the bombing were being treated.</p><p>\"I, and I think all of the law enforcement officials, are hoping for a host of reasons the suspect survives,\" the governor said after a ceremony at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, to honour the victims of the attack. \"We have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered.\"</p><p>The all-day manhunt okn Friday brought Boston to a near-standstill and put people on edge across the metropolitan area.</p><p>The break came at around nightfall when a homeowner in Watertown saw blood on his boat, pulled back the tarpaulin and saw Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside, police said. After an exchange of gunfire, he was seized and taken away in an ambulance.</p><p>Raucous celebrations erupted in and around Boston, with chants of \"USA! USA!\" Residents flooded the streets in relief four days after the two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and other shrapnel went off.</p><p>During the long night of violence leading up to the capture, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT policeman, severely wounded another officer and took part in a furious shootout and car chase in which they hurled explosives at police from a large homemade arsenal, authorities said.</p><p>The chief of Watertown police,  Edward Deveau, said one of the explosives was the same type used during the Boston Marathon attack, and authorities later recovered a pressure cooker lid embedded in a car further down the street. He said the suspects also tossed two grenades before Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition and police tackled him.</p><p>But while handcuffing him, officers had to take cover as Dzhokhar drove the carjacked Mercedes at them, Deveau said. The SUV dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. Police initially tracked the escaped suspect by a blood trail he left behind a house after abandoning the Mercedes, negotiating his surrender hours later.</p><p>Chechnya, where the Tsarnaev family has roots, has been the scene of two wars between Russian forces and separatists since 1994. That spawned an Islamic insurgency that has carried out deadly bombings in Russia and the region, although never before in the west.</p><p>Investigators have not offered a motive for the Boston attack. But in interviews with officials and those who knew the Tsarnaevs, a picture has emerged of the older brother as someone embittered toward the US, increasingly vehement in his Muslim faith and influential over his younger brother.</p><p>The Russian FSB intelligence service told the FBI in 2011 about information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, two law enforcement officials said on Saturday.</p><p>According to an FBI news release, a foreign government said  Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared to be strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the US to travel to the Russian region to join unspecified underground groups.</p><p>The FBI did not name the foreign government, but the two officials said it was Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk publicly about the matter.</p><p>The FBI said in response that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and relatives, and did not find any domestic or foreign terrorism activity. The bureau said it looked into his telephone and online activity, travel and his associations with others.</p><p>An uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers said he had a row with Tamerlan over his increased commitment to Islam.</p><p>Ruslan Tsarni from Maryland said Tamerlan told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen \"God's business\" over work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam.</p><p>Tsarni said his relationship with his nephew ended after that call. He said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been \"absolutely wasted by his older brother. I mean, he used him. He used him for whatever he's done.\"</p><p>Albrecht Ammon, a neighbour of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in Cambridge, said in an interview that the older brother held strong political views about the US. Ammon quoted Tsarnaev as saying  theUS used the Bible as \"an excuse for invading other countries\".</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev studied accounting as a part-time student at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston for three semesters from 2006 to 2008, the school said.

The capture came at the end of a tense Friday that began with the death of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, in a gun battle with police.</p><p>US officials said an elite interrogation team would question the Massachusetts college student without reading him his Miranda rights, something that is allowed on a limited basis when the public may be in immediate danger, such as instances in which it is feared bombs are planted and ready to be detonated.</p><p>The ACLU executive director, Anthony Romero, said the legal exception applied only when there was a continued threat to public safety and was \"not an open-ended exception\" to the Miranda rule, which guarantees the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.</p><p>The federal public defender's office in Massachusetts said it had agreed to represent Tsarnaev once he is charged. Miriam Conrad, public defender for Massachusetts, said he should have a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there were \"serious issues regarding possible interrogation\".</p><p>There was no immediate word on when Tsarnaev might be charged and what those charges would be. The twin bombings in Boston last Monday killed three people and wounded more than 180.</p><p>The most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty.</p><p>President Barack Obama said there were many unanswered questions about the bombings, including whether the Tsarnaev brothers – ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who had been in the US for about a decade and lived in the Boston area – had help from others. The president urged people not to rush into judgment about their motivations.</p><p>The Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, said on Saturday that Tsarnaev remained in a serious but stable condition and was probably unable to communicate. Tsarnaev was admitted to Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where 11 victims of the bombing were being treated.</p><p>\"I, and I think all of the law enforcement officials, are hoping for a host of reasons the suspect survives,\" the governor said after a ceremony at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, to honour the victims of the attack. \"We have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered.\"</p><p>The all-day manhunt okn Friday brought Boston to a near-standstill and put people on edge across the metropolitan area.</p><p>The break came at around nightfall when a homeowner in Watertown saw blood on his boat, pulled back the tarpaulin and saw Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside, police said. After an exchange of gunfire, he was seized and taken away in an ambulance.</p><p>Raucous celebrations erupted in and around Boston, with chants of \"USA! USA!\" Residents flooded the streets in relief four days after the two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and other shrapnel went off.</p><p>During the long night of violence leading up to the capture, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT policeman, severely wounded another officer and took part in a furious shootout and car chase in which they hurled explosives at police from a large homemade arsenal, authorities said.</p><p>The chief of Watertown police,  Edward Deveau, said one of the explosives was the same type used during the Boston Marathon attack, and authorities later recovered a pressure cooker lid embedded in a car further down the street. He said the suspects also tossed two grenades before Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition and police tackled him.</p><p>But while handcuffing him, officers had to take cover as Dzhokhar drove the carjacked Mercedes at them, Deveau said. The SUV dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. Police initially tracked the escaped suspect by a blood trail he left behind a house after abandoning the Mercedes, negotiating his surrender hours later.</p><p>Chechnya, where the Tsarnaev family has roots, has been the scene of two wars between Russian forces and separatists since 1994. That spawned an Islamic insurgency that has carried out deadly bombings in Russia and the region, although never before in the west.</p><p>Investigators have not offered a motive for the Boston attack. But in interviews with officials and those who knew the Tsarnaevs, a picture has emerged of the older brother as someone embittered toward the US, increasingly vehement in his Muslim faith and influential over his younger brother.</p><p>The Russian FSB intelligence service told the FBI in 2011 about information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, two law enforcement officials said on Saturday.</p><p>According to an FBI news release, a foreign government said  Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared to be strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the US to travel to the Russian region to join unspecified underground groups.</p><p>The FBI did not name the foreign government, but the two officials said it was Russia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk publicly about the matter.</p><p>The FBI said in response that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and relatives, and did not find any domestic or foreign terrorism activity. The bureau said it looked into his telephone and online activity, travel and his associations with others.</p><p>An uncle of the Tsarnaev brothers said he had a row with Tamerlan over his increased commitment to Islam.</p><p>Ruslan Tsarni from Maryland said Tamerlan told him in a 2009 phone conversation that he had chosen \"God's business\" over work or school. Tsarni said he then contacted a family friend who told him Tsarnaev had been influenced by a recent convert to Islam.</p><p>Tsarni said his relationship with his nephew ended after that call. He said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been \"absolutely wasted by his older brother. I mean, he used him. He used him for whatever he's done.\"</p><p>Albrecht Ammon, a neighbour of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in Cambridge, said in an interview that the older brother held strong political views about the US. Ammon quoted Tsarnaev as saying  theUS used the Bible as \"an excuse for invading other countries\".</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev studied accounting as a part-time student at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston for three semesters from 2006 to 2008, the school said. He was married with a young daughter. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth.</p><p>As of Saturday, more than 50 victims of the bombing remained in hospital, with three in a critical condition.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But that hasn't stopped them speculating. In retrospect, from the testimony of those who knew him, there were signs. But nobody could have predicted anything on this scale. What influences came to bear? What motives could there be? What would drive a young man to wilfully murder as many innocents as possible, leaving the country both vulnerable and mournful?</p><p>I pose these questions not of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\" title=\"\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a>, the 19-year-old chief surviving suspect in the Boston bombing saga that left three dead and injured more than 170 last week, but of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/nyregion/adam-lanza-an-enigma-who-is-now-identified-as-a-mass-killer.html\" title=\"\">Adam Lanza</a>, who shot 20 children and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut in December. The contradictions in the political responses to the two tragedies and the issues they raise could not be more glaring or obscene.</p><p>On Monday the Boston Marathon was bombed. Within a day of suspects being identified, politicians who defended the status quo on guns were calling for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/04/20/peter_king_calls_for_increased_surveillance_of_muslims_after_boston/\" title=\"\">\"increased surveillance of Muslims\"</a> and addressing <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/04/sen_grassley_in_judiciary_committee_conflates_immigration_regulation_with_boston_violence.html\" title=\"\">\"loopholes in the immigration system\"</a> (Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a firefight, grew up in Kyrgyzstan).</p><p>On Wednesday the Senate declined to pass even the most anaemic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/senate-debates-gun-control-package-live\" title=\"\">gun control measures</a> in response to the Newtown shootings. Twenty children, aged between six and seven, are slaughtered in school and the American polity takes five months to decide do nothing. Unable to break the filibuster limit, it didn't even come to a vote. Hiding behind the National Rifle Association's (NRA) talking points, gun rights senators cloaked themselves in the constitution, insisting support for gun control would violate the second amendment \"right to bear arms\".</p><p>While the authorities <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/20/boston-marathon-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-mirnada-rights\" title=\"\">denied the still unconscious Dzhokhar his Miranda rights</a> (informing him that he has the right to remain silent), some Republicans insisted he be tried as \"an enemy combatant\" – the legal aberration and moral abomination that paved the way to Guantánamo Bay. Their devotion to constitutional rights, it turns out, is partial; their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/americas-deadly-devotion-guns\" title=\"\">embrace of guns</a> is complete. <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2011/why-nra-opposes-gun-control-supporters%60.aspx?s=&st=&ps\" title=\"\">The NRA even opposes legislation banning gun sales to people on the terrorist watchlist</a>, meaning those who can't board a flight can still lock and load.</p><p>As John Oliver, a UK comedian on the Daily Show, noted: \"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb and we all have to take off our shoes at the airport. Thirty one school shootings since Columbine and no change in the regulation of guns.\"</p><p>The ramifications of this neglect cannot be overstated. More than 85 people – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/09/usa.usgunviolence\" title=\"\">including eight children</a> – are killed with guns on an average day in America and more than twice that number are injured. Even taking into account the fact that most gun deaths are suicides, that's still several times the death toll of 9/11 every year.</p><p>Numbers alone, however, don't quite do the cognitive dissonance justice. The effect of a terrorist attack such as Boston cannot be measured in the number of slain alone. Terrorism creates a culture of fear and suspicion that spreads beyond those immediately affected and impacts upon our understanding of risk. It means no one feels safe, anyone is a potential suspect and danger could be anywhere. \"Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack,\" writes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai\" title=\"\">Arjun Appadurai</a> in Fear of Small Numbers. \"Terror … opens the possibility that anyone may be a soldier in disguise, a sleeper among us, waiting to strike at the heart of our social slumber.\"</p><p>The trouble is this is precisely the culture that many Americans have lived in for years. It's estimated that in Chicago <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060612/12mavericks.htm\" title=\"\">20-30% of the children have witnessed a school shooting</a>. Carolyn Murray, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/12/barack-obama-gun-violence-chicago\" title=\"\">whose son was shot dead on his grandmother's lawn in a Chicago suburb</a>, does not enjoy much in the way of \"social slumber\". She has become so accustomed to gunfire at the weekends she could call the police and tell them what calibre was used and the direction of the shooting, just by listening in bed. Put bluntly, a significant section of America lives in constant terror and Congress just decided they should continue to do so.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169083/aurora-another-mass-killing-shocks-america-why#\" title=\"\">hierarchy of suffering and security in America</a> there are, in short, places where you are supposed to be safe – marathons, suburban schools, cinemas – and places where you are apparently entitled to no such expectation: particularly poor black and Latino neighbourhoods. Only in a handful of exceptions – when the killers are white, American-born Christians (the media has developed no default anxiety about them), the dead mostly white and the murders in large numbers – do shootings stand a chance of attracting mainstream political attention. Even then, only rarely, and even then, as last week proved, to little tangible effect.</p><p></p><p>The uncomfortable reality is that there is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/boston-bombings-expose-limits-of-post-911-security/2013/04/20/c9bbeda6-a921-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_story.html\" title=\"\">precious little that can be done to prevent an atrocity such as that in Boston</a>. \"We've had a lot of successes in degrading the ability of al-Qaida to launch massive attacks,\" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor and member of the house intelligence committee, told the Washington Post. \"But we've had a proliferation of one-off, foreign-born plots and self-radicalised individuals … We're going to have to recognise a certain vulnerability, and adopt a determined view that we will go on as we have, taking prudent precautions, but not changing the way we live.\"</p><p>Conversely there is a great deal that can be done to change the way Americans die daily. Gun rights advocates insist the gun-control measure that had the best chance last week, which demanded background checks for guns sold online and at gun shows, would not have prevented Lanza's crime. He used his mother's gun, which had been purchased legally. That's true, although since <a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/studies/view/240/\" title=\"\">90% of Americans and even 74% of gun-owning members of the NRA</a> agreed with it, they should have passed it anyway.

But that hasn't stopped them speculating. In retrospect, from the testimony of those who knew him, there were signs. But nobody could have predicted anything on this scale. What influences came to bear? What motives could there be? What would drive a young man to wilfully murder as many innocents as possible, leaving the country both vulnerable and mournful?</p><p>I pose these questions not of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\" title=\"\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a>, the 19-year-old chief surviving suspect in the Boston bombing saga that left three dead and injured more than 170 last week, but of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/nyregion/adam-lanza-an-enigma-who-is-now-identified-as-a-mass-killer.html\" title=\"\">Adam Lanza</a>, who shot 20 children and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut in December. The contradictions in the political responses to the two tragedies and the issues they raise could not be more glaring or obscene.</p><p>On Monday the Boston Marathon was bombed. Within a day of suspects being identified, politicians who defended the status quo on guns were calling for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/04/20/peter_king_calls_for_increased_surveillance_of_muslims_after_boston/\" title=\"\">\"increased surveillance of Muslims\"</a> and addressing <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/04/sen_grassley_in_judiciary_committee_conflates_immigration_regulation_with_boston_violence.html\" title=\"\">\"loopholes in the immigration system\"</a> (Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a firefight, grew up in Kyrgyzstan).</p><p>On Wednesday the Senate declined to pass even the most anaemic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/senate-debates-gun-control-package-live\" title=\"\">gun control measures</a> in response to the Newtown shootings. Twenty children, aged between six and seven, are slaughtered in school and the American polity takes five months to decide do nothing. Unable to break the filibuster limit, it didn't even come to a vote. Hiding behind the National Rifle Association's (NRA) talking points, gun rights senators cloaked themselves in the constitution, insisting support for gun control would violate the second amendment \"right to bear arms\".</p><p>While the authorities <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/20/boston-marathon-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-mirnada-rights\" title=\"\">denied the still unconscious Dzhokhar his Miranda rights</a> (informing him that he has the right to remain silent), some Republicans insisted he be tried as \"an enemy combatant\" – the legal aberration and moral abomination that paved the way to Guantánamo Bay. Their devotion to constitutional rights, it turns out, is partial; their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/americas-deadly-devotion-guns\" title=\"\">embrace of guns</a> is complete. <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2011/why-nra-opposes-gun-control-supporters%60.aspx?s=&st=&ps\" title=\"\">The NRA even opposes legislation banning gun sales to people on the terrorist watchlist</a>, meaning those who can't board a flight can still lock and load.</p><p>As John Oliver, a UK comedian on the Daily Show, noted: \"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb and we all have to take off our shoes at the airport. Thirty one school shootings since Columbine and no change in the regulation of guns.\"</p><p>The ramifications of this neglect cannot be overstated. More than 85 people – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/09/usa.usgunviolence\" title=\"\">including eight children</a> – are killed with guns on an average day in America and more than twice that number are injured. Even taking into account the fact that most gun deaths are suicides, that's still several times the death toll of 9/11 every year.</p><p>Numbers alone, however, don't quite do the cognitive dissonance justice. The effect of a terrorist attack such as Boston cannot be measured in the number of slain alone. Terrorism creates a culture of fear and suspicion that spreads beyond those immediately affected and impacts upon our understanding of risk. It means no one feels safe, anyone is a potential suspect and danger could be anywhere. \"Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack,\" writes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai\" title=\"\">Arjun Appadurai</a> in Fear of Small Numbers. \"Terror … opens the possibility that anyone may be a soldier in disguise, a sleeper among us, waiting to strike at the heart of our social slumber.\"</p><p>The trouble is this is precisely the culture that many Americans have lived in for years. It's estimated that in Chicago <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060612/12mavericks.htm\" title=\"\">20-30% of the children have witnessed a school shooting</a>. Carolyn Murray, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/12/barack-obama-gun-violence-chicago\" title=\"\">whose son was shot dead on his grandmother's lawn in a Chicago suburb</a>, does not enjoy much in the way of \"social slumber\". She has become so accustomed to gunfire at the weekends she could call the police and tell them what calibre was used and the direction of the shooting, just by listening in bed. Put bluntly, a significant section of America lives in constant terror and Congress just decided they should continue to do so.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169083/aurora-another-mass-killing-shocks-america-why#\" title=\"\">hierarchy of suffering and security in America</a> there are, in short, places where you are supposed to be safe – marathons, suburban schools, cinemas – and places where you are apparently entitled to no such expectation: particularly poor black and Latino neighbourhoods. Only in a handful of exceptions – when the killers are white, American-born Christians (the media has developed no default anxiety about them), the dead mostly white and the murders in large numbers – do shootings stand a chance of attracting mainstream political attention. Even then, only rarely, and even then, as last week proved, to little tangible effect.</p><p></p><p>The uncomfortable reality is that there is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/boston-bombings-expose-limits-of-post-911-security/2013/04/20/c9bbeda6-a921-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_story.html\" title=\"\">precious little that can be done to prevent an atrocity such as that in Boston</a>. \"We've had a lot of successes in degrading the ability of al-Qaida to launch massive attacks,\" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor and member of the house intelligence committee, told the Washington Post. \"But we've had a proliferation of one-off, foreign-born plots and self-radicalised individuals … We're going to have to recognise a certain vulnerability, and adopt a determined view that we will go on as we have, taking prudent precautions, but not changing the way we live.\"</p><p>Conversely there is a great deal that can be done to change the way Americans die daily. Gun rights advocates insist the gun-control measure that had the best chance last week, which demanded background checks for guns sold online and at gun shows, would not have prevented Lanza's crime. He used his mother's gun, which had been purchased legally. That's true, although since <a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/studies/view/240/\" title=\"\">90% of Americans and even 74% of gun-owning members of the NRA</a> agreed with it, they should have passed it anyway. But the reason the compromise proposal was so tepid is because they scuppered efforts to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which enabled Lanza to kill far more children far more quickly.</p><p>Expressing frustration at the failure to pass anything, Andrew Goddard, whose son Colin was injured during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/us/politics/despite-tearful-pleas-no-real-chance.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\" title=\"\">told the New York Times</a>: \"It's almost like you can see the finish line, but you just can't get there.

It has also attracted attention by selling more than £50m worth of wheat to the World Food Programme.</p><p>Trafigura, which came to global political attention when it was revealed that a licensed independent contractor of a ship it had chartered dumped tonnes of toxic oil slops in Ivory Coast, said: \"We can confirm that Trafigura has traded with Iralco in the past. In October 2011, a physical swap agreement was reached whereby Trafigura provided alumina to Iralco in return for aluminium for Trafigura to export worldwide. No deliveries have been made or exports received since new EU sanctions were published in December 2012. Trafigura Group companies are compliant with national and international law where applicable.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/glencore\">Glencore</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iran\">Iran</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/stock-markets\">Stock markets</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ipos\">IPOs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/commodities\">Commodities</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rupertneate\">Rupert Neate</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Her dazed, red-eyed widower and 12-year-old younger daughter clambered over the ruins on Sunday, salvaging stray items: a toy giraffe; a single trainer; letters.</p><p>Wang's elder daughter barely had time to comfort them before she left to tend to the stream of patients at a nearby hospital. \"Mum, I need to help other people now,\" the nurse said as she left her mother's graveside.</p><p>More than 200 people are dead or missing after the powerful earthquake rocked Sichuan, south-west China, at 8.02am on Saturday  – arousing memories of the devastating shock along the same faultline that killed tens of thousands in the province five years ago next month.</p><p>Another 11,800 are injured, almost 1,000 seriously, and an estimated 100,000 homeless. Blocked roads and damaged communications have hampered efforts to rescue survivors and provide emergency shelter and supplies, with aftershocks of 5.4 magnitude triggering repeated landslides.</p><p>Wang's sister-in-law, Zhang Dexiang, was working at a brick factory when the quake struck \"We started work as usual at 8am, but all the machines began jumping,\" she said. \"We panicked and ran outside. We all rushed back home but by the time I got here there was nothing left. When we dug [Wang] out, she was already dead.\"</p><p>Wang, 45, was a warm, gentle woman, loved for her kindness to children and the elderly. Due to a disability, she stayed at home raising pigs while the rest of the household went out to work; she was the only one there when the house collapsed around her.</p><p>Now her family are sheltering under a tarpaulin with the meagre possessions they retrieved: a few wooden stools and a couple of quilts. \"We have nothing,\" said Zhang.</p><p>The wreckage of the 6.6 magnitude quake lay strewn across the area around the epicentre near Ya'an city: a car crushed by a huge boulder; cracks in the roads and toppled telegraph poles; ceilings and walls that had slammed to the ground; pavements thick with bricks strewn by slumping buildings; a house now useless but so new that its windows still bore tape when they crashed from their frames. In one sagging building, an enormous hog, loosed by the quake, rooted through its master's destroyed kitchen.</p><p>The area is known for its beauty: its river gorges, thick bamboo groves and lush green paddy fields. But the steep wooded slopes bore the red scars of landslides, and aftershocks continued to shake the ground on Sunday, further unnerving survivors.</p><p>The Sichuan meteorological observatory warned that rain was likely in the quake zone over the next three days. The county government for Lushan, badly hit by the disaster, said water had already been drained from five reservoirs that had suffered cracks and leakage to protect residents.</p><p>The Chinese premier Li Keqiang flew into the disaster zone, where he met rescuers and survivors. \"Treat and heal your wounds with peace of mind,\" the state news agency Xinhua quoted Li as telling patients at a hospital. \"The government will take care of all the costs for those severely wounded.\"</p><p>State media said that rescuers had pulled a three-month-old baby alive from the rubble of her mountain home, although her mother had died in the quake. In another development, a 12-year-old girl reportedly emerged from a coma as she was treated at a military hospital in Chengdu after she was dug out of the ruins of their house.</p><p>Thousands of troops have swarmed the area, clearing roads, restoring communications, helping specialist teams to search for survivors and setting up camps for the homeless. Xinhua said 18,000 soldiers had been dispatched.</p><p>But landslides reblocked cleared roads, officials said. Military and rescue vehicles also congested the narrow mountain road from Ya'an city to Lushan, which was closed to all but emergency vehicles for hours.</p><p>Hundreds of armed police marched in single file, bearing shovels, to Baoxing, one of the worst hit areas, before the route was repaired late on Sunday. At least 26 died there and 40,000 are homeless, the state news agency reported.</p><p>Xinhua warned that rescuers had yet to reach some parts of the quake zone. But Chen Yong, the vice director of the Ya'an city government earthquake response office, told reporters that he believed the death toll was unlikely to rise dramatically.</p><p>Casualties include two rescuers who were in a vehicle that plunged off a 300-metre cliff in Baoxing county, Xinhua said.</p><p>China's foreign ministry said foreign rescue teams and medical and relief supplies were not needed, citing the problems with traffic and communications in the quake zone.</p><p>\"The Lushan county centre is getting back to normal, but the need is still considerable in terms of shelter and materials,\" said Kevin Xia of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Supplies have had difficulty getting into the region because of the traffic jams. Most of our supplies are still on the way.\"</p><p>Throughout the disaster zone, survivors sat along the roadside, some with bloodied bandages, under crude shelters they had arranged themselves or emergency tents from rescuers.</p><p>Though relief teams quickly set up camps in some areas, survivors were still begging workers for tents. Xinhua reported shortages of drinking water and at one junction, a group of children and old people held up cardboard signs pleading for water.</p><p>Li Baojun, deputy head of the disaster relief department of the civil affairs ministry, said 30,000 tents, 50,000 quilts and 10,000 camp beds would be transported to the provincial capital Chengdu for distribution to affected areas as soon as possible.</p><p>Disease prevention work has already started, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said, and psychological help will be provided for vulnerable people.</p><p>One woman described how her legs had turned to jelly as she watched her house fall down – but beamed as she recalled the moment she saw her children emerge unscathed.</p><p>\"We heard an explosion in the mountains first, like an eruption from a volcano,\" said 40-year-old Peng Guiwu, wearing a neighbour's clothes because she had not dressed when the shock hit.</p><p>\"Then dust started falling and the houses were groaning and everything started collapsing. My husband and I grabbed our kids and ran. Everything was moving,\" she added, showing the scars on her legs and arm where furniture had smashed into her as she escaped. \"I was scared to death – the children were so frightened they clung to us.\"</p><p>Though 2008's earthquake was many times the power of Saturday's, and far more deadly, it left Ya'an and the surrounding area largely unscathed.</p><p>\"Last time there were only a few tiles that came loose and we repaired it very quickly,\" said Peng, whose house now bears a long crack down its front. \"But we learnt from that earthquake. We used quilts to cover our heads.\"</p><p>Many residents said the training and information programmes that followed the last earthquake had taught them what to do: leave at once, protect your heads, gather well away from buildings.

Her dazed, red-eyed widower and 12-year-old younger daughter clambered over the ruins on Sunday, salvaging stray items: a toy giraffe; a single trainer; letters.</p><p>Wang's elder daughter barely had time to comfort them before she left to tend to the stream of patients at a nearby hospital. \"Mum, I need to help other people now,\" the nurse said as she left her mother's graveside.</p><p>More than 200 people are dead or missing after the powerful earthquake rocked Sichuan, south-west China, at 8.02am on Saturday  – arousing memories of the devastating shock along the same faultline that killed tens of thousands in the province five years ago next month.</p><p>Another 11,800 are injured, almost 1,000 seriously, and an estimated 100,000 homeless. Blocked roads and damaged communications have hampered efforts to rescue survivors and provide emergency shelter and supplies, with aftershocks of 5.4 magnitude triggering repeated landslides.</p><p>Wang's sister-in-law, Zhang Dexiang, was working at a brick factory when the quake struck \"We started work as usual at 8am, but all the machines began jumping,\" she said. \"We panicked and ran outside. We all rushed back home but by the time I got here there was nothing left. When we dug [Wang] out, she was already dead.\"</p><p>Wang, 45, was a warm, gentle woman, loved for her kindness to children and the elderly. Due to a disability, she stayed at home raising pigs while the rest of the household went out to work; she was the only one there when the house collapsed around her.</p><p>Now her family are sheltering under a tarpaulin with the meagre possessions they retrieved: a few wooden stools and a couple of quilts. \"We have nothing,\" said Zhang.</p><p>The wreckage of the 6.6 magnitude quake lay strewn across the area around the epicentre near Ya'an city: a car crushed by a huge boulder; cracks in the roads and toppled telegraph poles; ceilings and walls that had slammed to the ground; pavements thick with bricks strewn by slumping buildings; a house now useless but so new that its windows still bore tape when they crashed from their frames. In one sagging building, an enormous hog, loosed by the quake, rooted through its master's destroyed kitchen.</p><p>The area is known for its beauty: its river gorges, thick bamboo groves and lush green paddy fields. But the steep wooded slopes bore the red scars of landslides, and aftershocks continued to shake the ground on Sunday, further unnerving survivors.</p><p>The Sichuan meteorological observatory warned that rain was likely in the quake zone over the next three days. The county government for Lushan, badly hit by the disaster, said water had already been drained from five reservoirs that had suffered cracks and leakage to protect residents.</p><p>The Chinese premier Li Keqiang flew into the disaster zone, where he met rescuers and survivors. \"Treat and heal your wounds with peace of mind,\" the state news agency Xinhua quoted Li as telling patients at a hospital. \"The government will take care of all the costs for those severely wounded.\"</p><p>State media said that rescuers had pulled a three-month-old baby alive from the rubble of her mountain home, although her mother had died in the quake. In another development, a 12-year-old girl reportedly emerged from a coma as she was treated at a military hospital in Chengdu after she was dug out of the ruins of their house.</p><p>Thousands of troops have swarmed the area, clearing roads, restoring communications, helping specialist teams to search for survivors and setting up camps for the homeless. Xinhua said 18,000 soldiers had been dispatched.</p><p>But landslides reblocked cleared roads, officials said. Military and rescue vehicles also congested the narrow mountain road from Ya'an city to Lushan, which was closed to all but emergency vehicles for hours.</p><p>Hundreds of armed police marched in single file, bearing shovels, to Baoxing, one of the worst hit areas, before the route was repaired late on Sunday. At least 26 died there and 40,000 are homeless, the state news agency reported.</p><p>Xinhua warned that rescuers had yet to reach some parts of the quake zone. But Chen Yong, the vice director of the Ya'an city government earthquake response office, told reporters that he believed the death toll was unlikely to rise dramatically.</p><p>Casualties include two rescuers who were in a vehicle that plunged off a 300-metre cliff in Baoxing county, Xinhua said.</p><p>China's foreign ministry said foreign rescue teams and medical and relief supplies were not needed, citing the problems with traffic and communications in the quake zone.</p><p>\"The Lushan county centre is getting back to normal, but the need is still considerable in terms of shelter and materials,\" said Kevin Xia of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Supplies have had difficulty getting into the region because of the traffic jams. Most of our supplies are still on the way.\"</p><p>Throughout the disaster zone, survivors sat along the roadside, some with bloodied bandages, under crude shelters they had arranged themselves or emergency tents from rescuers.</p><p>Though relief teams quickly set up camps in some areas, survivors were still begging workers for tents. Xinhua reported shortages of drinking water and at one junction, a group of children and old people held up cardboard signs pleading for water.</p><p>Li Baojun, deputy head of the disaster relief department of the civil affairs ministry, said 30,000 tents, 50,000 quilts and 10,000 camp beds would be transported to the provincial capital Chengdu for distribution to affected areas as soon as possible.</p><p>Disease prevention work has already started, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said, and psychological help will be provided for vulnerable people.</p><p>One woman described how her legs had turned to jelly as she watched her house fall down – but beamed as she recalled the moment she saw her children emerge unscathed.</p><p>\"We heard an explosion in the mountains first, like an eruption from a volcano,\" said 40-year-old Peng Guiwu, wearing a neighbour's clothes because she had not dressed when the shock hit.</p><p>\"Then dust started falling and the houses were groaning and everything started collapsing. My husband and I grabbed our kids and ran. Everything was moving,\" she added, showing the scars on her legs and arm where furniture had smashed into her as she escaped. \"I was scared to death – the children were so frightened they clung to us.\"</p><p>Though 2008's earthquake was many times the power of Saturday's, and far more deadly, it left Ya'an and the surrounding area largely unscathed.</p><p>\"Last time there were only a few tiles that came loose and we repaired it very quickly,\" said Peng, whose house now bears a long crack down its front. \"But we learnt from that earthquake. We used quilts to cover our heads.\"</p><p>Many residents said the training and information programmes that followed the last earthquake had taught them what to do: leave at once, protect your heads, gather well away from buildings. That helped to ensure that a mother escaped with her seven-day-old baby unscathed; and that a 15-year-old boy carried his little sister to safety while his mother was out.</p><p>But Peng's neighbour lost her little girl in the quake, and was lying injured in hospital. Tan Xuelan, 84, could not move as the house collapsed around her and was saved by the kindness of a neighbour, who returned to carry her to safety. And Wang, who found it hard to walk due to her disability, was crushed before she could make it out of the door.</p><p>Experience was not enough to save those who were too small, too slow or simply too unlucky.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/earthquakes\">Earthquakes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/natural-disasters\">Natural disasters and extreme weather</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific\">Asia Pacific</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan\">Tania Branigan</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It turns out that Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, who originally framed the argument that too high a \"debt-to-GDP ratio\" will always, necessarily, lead to economic contraction – and who had aggressively promoted it during Rogoff's tenure as chief economist for the IMF –, had based their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity\" title=\"\">entire argument on a spreadsheet error</a>. The premise behind the cuts turns out to be faulty. There is now no definite proof that high levels of debt necessarily lead to recession.</p><p>Will we, then, see a reversal of policy? A sea of mea culpas from politicians who have spent the last few years telling disabled pensioners to give up their bus passes and poor students to forgo college, all on the basis of a mistake? It seems unlikely. After all, as I and many others have long argued, austerity was never really an economic policy: ultimately, it was always about morality. We are talking about a politics of crime and punishment, sin and atonement. True, it's never been particularly clear exactly what the original sin was: some combination, perhaps, of tax avoidance, laziness, benefit fraud and the election of irresponsible leaders. But in a larger sense, the message was that we were guilty of having dreamed of social security, humane working conditions, pensions, social and economic democracy.</p><p>The morality of debt has proved spectacularly good politics. It appears to work just as well whatever form it takes: fiscal sadism (Dutch and German voters really do believe that Greek, Spanish and Irish citizens are all, collectively, as they put it, \"debt sinners\", and vow support for politicians willing to punish them) or fiscal masochism (middle-class Britons really will dutifully vote for candidates who tell them that government has been on a binge, that they must tighten their belts, it'll be hard, but it's something we can all do for the sake of our grandchildren).

It turns out that Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, who originally framed the argument that too high a \"debt-to-GDP ratio\" will always, necessarily, lead to economic contraction – and who had aggressively promoted it during Rogoff's tenure as chief economist for the IMF –, had based their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity\" title=\"\">entire argument on a spreadsheet error</a>. The premise behind the cuts turns out to be faulty. There is now no definite proof that high levels of debt necessarily lead to recession.</p><p>Will we, then, see a reversal of policy? A sea of mea culpas from politicians who have spent the last few years telling disabled pensioners to give up their bus passes and poor students to forgo college, all on the basis of a mistake? It seems unlikely. After all, as I and many others have long argued, austerity was never really an economic policy: ultimately, it was always about morality. We are talking about a politics of crime and punishment, sin and atonement. True, it's never been particularly clear exactly what the original sin was: some combination, perhaps, of tax avoidance, laziness, benefit fraud and the election of irresponsible leaders. But in a larger sense, the message was that we were guilty of having dreamed of social security, humane working conditions, pensions, social and economic democracy.</p><p>The morality of debt has proved spectacularly good politics. It appears to work just as well whatever form it takes: fiscal sadism (Dutch and German voters really do believe that Greek, Spanish and Irish citizens are all, collectively, as they put it, \"debt sinners\", and vow support for politicians willing to punish them) or fiscal masochism (middle-class Britons really will dutifully vote for candidates who tell them that government has been on a binge, that they must tighten their belts, it'll be hard, but it's something we can all do for the sake of our grandchildren). Politicians locate economic theories that provide flashy equations to justify the politics; their authors, like Rogoff, are celebrated as oracles; no one bothers to check if the numbers actually add up.</p><p>If ever proof was required that the theory is selected to suit the politics, one need only consider the reaction politicians have to economists who dare suggest this moralistic framework is unnecessary; or that there might be solutions that don't involve widespread human suffering.</p><p>Even before we knew Reinhart and Rogoff's study was simply wrong, many had pointed out their historical survey made no distinction between the effects of debt on countries such as the US or Japan – which issue their own currency and therefore have their debt denominated in that currency – and countries such as Ireland, Greece, that do not.

He was captured on Friday night, a day after a violent gun battle with police that left his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, dead.</p><p>Boston mayor Tom Menino told This Week on ABC that he was so seriously ill that agents might never be able to interrogate him. \"We don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,\" he said.</p><p>Dan Coats, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC: \"The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat. It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a condition where we can't get any information from him at all.\"</p><h2>FBI 'dropped the ball'</h2><p>As the FBI waited to question Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, it faced intense scrutiny over its prior contacts with his brother. One congressman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/21/fbi-tamerlan-tsarnaev-questioning\">accused the FBI of having \"dropped the ball\"</a>.</p><p>The bureau admitted that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in early 2011 at the request of a foreign government, believed to be Russia, which had concerns he was linked to Islamist terrorism. The FBI said it concluded he was not involved in terrorism, and was left scrambling at the weekend to find out more about a six-month visit he made to Russia in 2012.</p><p>There was also concern on Sunday about how federal investigators would deal with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev if he recovers sufficiently to be questioned and tried. He was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any information he provided before being read his rights would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger.</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda rights by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/20/boston-suspect-miranda-rights-activists\">civil rights advocates expressed concern</a> about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\".</p><p>That was not a concern for some political figures, who claim there is enough evidence against Tsarnaev to outweigh the advantages of reading him his Miranda rights. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, described \"chilling\" surveillance video from the Boston Marathon bombings which showed the younger brother at the heart of the attacks. The film shows him dropping his backpack and calmly waking away before the bomb exploded, Patrick said.</p><p>\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\" Patrick said on NBC. \"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\" Patrick conceded that he had not viewed all the tapes but had been briefed about them by law enforcement officials.</p><p>More details emerged at the weekend of the suspects' race to evade capture. As the authorities closed in on Thursday night in the Watertown area, the Tsarnaev brothers are accused of killing an officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police, severely wounding a Boston transit officer and engaging in a frenzied car chase and shootout during which they bombarded officers with explosives, including a pressure-cooker bomb.</p><p>The chief of Watertown police, Edward Deveau, said officers attempted to tackle Tamerlan Tsanaev when he ran out of ammunition, but had to take cover as his younger brother drove a carjacked Mercedes at them. The SUV dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. The suspect was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Meanwhile Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escapted on foot. He was eventually captured late on Friday night after a resident discovered a bloody trail leading to a boat in his backyard. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where security was tight on Sunday.</p><p>As authorities guarded Tsarnaev, attention turned a trip to Russia in 2012 by his older brother. His family has claimed Tamerlan Tsarnaev went to Dagestan to visit his father, but an aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, told the Guardian on Sunday that he arrived in the area before his father. She said Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the United States in January 2012 and arrived in Dagestan around March. His father, Anzor Tsarnaev, only arrived in the republic in May. \"He came to become acquainted with [Dagestan],\" Suleimanova said. \"He would sit at home and pray. He was learning to read the Qur'an. He saw relatives, friends.\"</p><p>She hinted that times had become tough for the brothers after their father left the United States for Dagestan, followed a couple of months later by their mother, Zuneidat. Anzor Tsarnaev had bought a ticket for the United States for 16 April, she said, because the brothers were having money problems. \"He would send money from here when he could,\" she said.</p><p>US officials are investigating whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev built links with Dagestani rebels, fighting a heavy police state in order to build an Islamist caliphate along Russia's southern flank. Dagestan's main rebel group denied any links with the attack in a statement released on Sunday. </p><h2>'His views aren't mainstream'</h2><p>The FBI was criticised on Sunday for failing to follow up on Tsarnaev after its contacts in 2011. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina, told CNN's State of the Nation: \"The ball was dropped in one of two ways. The FBI missed a lot of things.\"</p><p>Republican Peter King, chairman of the House subcommittee on counterterrorism, was also critical. \"This is the firth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\" he told Fox News Sunday, citing the cases of al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, Little Rock shooter Carlos Bledsoe, the accused Fort Hood killer Nidal Malik and alleged American-Pakistani terrorist David Coleman Headley.</p><p>The New York Times reported on Sunday that a hold was placed on a citizenship request by the 26-year-old as a result of the FBI's former interest in him. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security decided not to grant his application after a routine background check uncovered the 2011 interview by agents, the report said.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been asked to leave a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three months ago, after he interrupted a prayer service to argue with the imam, who had referred to Martin Luther King Jr. A member of the mosque present at the service told the LA Times that Tsarnaev shouted: \"You cannot mention this guy because he's not a Muslim!\"</p><p>Imam Suhaib Webb, of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the city's largest mosque, said in an interview that he had recently heard of the incident. \"That's a sign right there that his views aren't mainstream,\" Webb said.</p><p>Bostonians gathered to remember the victims on Sunday. A few blocks from where the bombs exploded less than a week ago, hundreds packed into the Church of the Covenant in Boston. The church had thrown open its doors to worshippers from the city's Old South Church, located in the police area still closed off to the public, and most of the pews were full as the service began.</p><p>The scale of the bombings was immediately apparent as around half the congregation responded to a request from Rev Dr Jim Antal, president of the Massachusetts United Church of Christ, to raise their hands they were near the explosions or knew someone who was. \"Now raise your hand if you have visited or spoken with someone who was injured,\" Antal said.

He was captured on Friday night, a day after a violent gun battle with police that left his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, dead.</p><p>Boston mayor Tom Menino told This Week on ABC that he was so seriously ill that agents might never be able to interrogate him. \"We don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,\" he said.</p><p>Dan Coats, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC: \"The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat. It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a condition where we can't get any information from him at all.\"</p><h2>FBI 'dropped the ball'</h2><p>As the FBI waited to question Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, it faced intense scrutiny over its prior contacts with his brother. One congressman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/21/fbi-tamerlan-tsarnaev-questioning\">accused the FBI of having \"dropped the ball\"</a>.</p><p>The bureau admitted that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in early 2011 at the request of a foreign government, believed to be Russia, which had concerns he was linked to Islamist terrorism. The FBI said it concluded he was not involved in terrorism, and was left scrambling at the weekend to find out more about a six-month visit he made to Russia in 2012.</p><p>There was also concern on Sunday about how federal investigators would deal with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev if he recovers sufficiently to be questioned and tried. He was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any information he provided before being read his rights would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger.</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda rights by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/20/boston-suspect-miranda-rights-activists\">civil rights advocates expressed concern</a> about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\".</p><p>That was not a concern for some political figures, who claim there is enough evidence against Tsarnaev to outweigh the advantages of reading him his Miranda rights. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, described \"chilling\" surveillance video from the Boston Marathon bombings which showed the younger brother at the heart of the attacks. The film shows him dropping his backpack and calmly waking away before the bomb exploded, Patrick said.</p><p>\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\" Patrick said on NBC. \"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\" Patrick conceded that he had not viewed all the tapes but had been briefed about them by law enforcement officials.</p><p>More details emerged at the weekend of the suspects' race to evade capture. As the authorities closed in on Thursday night in the Watertown area, the Tsarnaev brothers are accused of killing an officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police, severely wounding a Boston transit officer and engaging in a frenzied car chase and shootout during which they bombarded officers with explosives, including a pressure-cooker bomb.</p><p>The chief of Watertown police, Edward Deveau, said officers attempted to tackle Tamerlan Tsanaev when he ran out of ammunition, but had to take cover as his younger brother drove a carjacked Mercedes at them. The SUV dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. The suspect was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Meanwhile Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escapted on foot. He was eventually captured late on Friday night after a resident discovered a bloody trail leading to a boat in his backyard. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where security was tight on Sunday.</p><p>As authorities guarded Tsarnaev, attention turned a trip to Russia in 2012 by his older brother. His family has claimed Tamerlan Tsarnaev went to Dagestan to visit his father, but an aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, told the Guardian on Sunday that he arrived in the area before his father. She said Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the United States in January 2012 and arrived in Dagestan around March. His father, Anzor Tsarnaev, only arrived in the republic in May. \"He came to become acquainted with [Dagestan],\" Suleimanova said. \"He would sit at home and pray. He was learning to read the Qur'an. He saw relatives, friends.\"</p><p>She hinted that times had become tough for the brothers after their father left the United States for Dagestan, followed a couple of months later by their mother, Zuneidat. Anzor Tsarnaev had bought a ticket for the United States for 16 April, she said, because the brothers were having money problems. \"He would send money from here when he could,\" she said.</p><p>US officials are investigating whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev built links with Dagestani rebels, fighting a heavy police state in order to build an Islamist caliphate along Russia's southern flank. Dagestan's main rebel group denied any links with the attack in a statement released on Sunday. </p><h2>'His views aren't mainstream'</h2><p>The FBI was criticised on Sunday for failing to follow up on Tsarnaev after its contacts in 2011. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina, told CNN's State of the Nation: \"The ball was dropped in one of two ways. The FBI missed a lot of things.\"</p><p>Republican Peter King, chairman of the House subcommittee on counterterrorism, was also critical. \"This is the firth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\" he told Fox News Sunday, citing the cases of al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, Little Rock shooter Carlos Bledsoe, the accused Fort Hood killer Nidal Malik and alleged American-Pakistani terrorist David Coleman Headley.</p><p>The New York Times reported on Sunday that a hold was placed on a citizenship request by the 26-year-old as a result of the FBI's former interest in him. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security decided not to grant his application after a routine background check uncovered the 2011 interview by agents, the report said.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been asked to leave a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three months ago, after he interrupted a prayer service to argue with the imam, who had referred to Martin Luther King Jr. A member of the mosque present at the service told the LA Times that Tsarnaev shouted: \"You cannot mention this guy because he's not a Muslim!\"</p><p>Imam Suhaib Webb, of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the city's largest mosque, said in an interview that he had recently heard of the incident. \"That's a sign right there that his views aren't mainstream,\" Webb said.</p><p>Bostonians gathered to remember the victims on Sunday. A few blocks from where the bombs exploded less than a week ago, hundreds packed into the Church of the Covenant in Boston. The church had thrown open its doors to worshippers from the city's Old South Church, located in the police area still closed off to the public, and most of the pews were full as the service began.</p><p>The scale of the bombings was immediately apparent as around half the congregation responded to a request from Rev Dr Jim Antal, president of the Massachusetts United Church of Christ, to raise their hands they were near the explosions or knew someone who was. \"Now raise your hand if you have visited or spoken with someone who was injured,\" Antal said.

On the 20th anniversary of his death we ask Robert Beckford, Helen Oyeyemi, Diane Abbott, Ashley Walters, Kele Okereke and Estelle what impact his death had on them and society</p><h2>'Middle-class hostility has been let off the hook'  <br />Robert Beckford Theologian</h2><p>I was accustomed to racialised attacks on individuals from the black community, so when I first heard about the murder of Stephen Lawrence, it was just one among the many. In Birmingham we had our own catalogue of attacks and a long history of people <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9781000/9781365.stm\" title=\"\">dying in custody</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article157672.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/neville-and-doreen-lawrence-image-2-907880698-157672.jpg\" title=\"\">image of Doreen and Neville Lawrence </a>was profoundly important for black people in Britain. In mainstream public life we tend to see images of black people only when it is to do with sports or entertainment, and images of black families only when it is around questions of immigration. This was a rare moment when black people were represented in a redemptive, even salvific, way. Here were a black man and woman who were trying to deal with their own personal tragedy, but also trying to redeem the nation; a dignified, hard-working couple whose son had aspirations to become an architect and was as close as you can get to the British dream. It pricked the moral conscience.</p><p>But I only really registered the case as being very important when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-jolted-nation-conscience\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela</a> came to Britain two weeks later. That was the moment most people became conscious of its connection with police corruption and racist discourse in the criminal justice system. The case provided us with a moment for reflection – we could have developed very aggressive policies to deal with racism in the workplace and institutional forms of racism, but we didn't. Instead we focused on the racist attack – because we can then blame <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/15/stephen-lawrence-killer-drops-appeal\" title=\"\">poorly educated, working-class white men</a> for racism. When the reality is that for most black people everyday forms of racism are not about people trying to attack you in the street, but instead are in the workplace, in the criminal justice system, in housing and in the micro forms of aggression you can experience when you go shopping. We have allowed the genteel middle-class hostility that most black people experience off the hook. And so it has been possible to maintain disadvantage in the workplace, schooling and public policy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the idea of \"institutional racism\" provided a language for critics of the state, but conversely meant public bodies could adopt the mantle of institional racism, publish the figures – and then do nothing about it, because the legislation didn't provide a sanction.</p><p>In higher education, some made an effort to recruit more black students and think about how to retain black staff. But in general it was really piecemeal and lukewarm. It wasn't the revision that North America went through in response to the civil rights movement, where black studies courses were introduced and they went out of their way to recruit black academics. Consequently, there hasn't been any major development post-Macpherson – we are in the same position as in the 1990s. And you could quite easily say we have gone backwards since the 1970s in creating a black intellectual class.</p><p>The black church tradition has changed, however. There was always a tension between the people on the streets and the people in the pews about the way forward for black Britons. The people on the streets would argue that society is racist and there are very limited opportunities for black people to progress, while the church argued that with hard work and discipline you could thrive in Britain's so-called meritocracy. After the murder it became easier for people on the streets to talk about racial disadvantage, racial attacks, corrupt policing and a faulty criminal justice system and get a hearing inside the church, which is the only nationwide institution within the black community.</p><p>Today, I think my students [at Canterbury Christ Church University] are more concerned with whether they can afford their education and get a decent job. And the reality for many black and Asian students is navigating an employment regime that is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/04/graduates-ethnic-minority\" title=\"\">weighted against them</a>. They have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover\" title=\"\">names and ethnicities</a> that are always the last to be hired and first to be fired in Britain. There is a great deal of underemployment among black and Asian graduates compared with their counterparts.</p><p>The myth about Stephen Lawrence is that he would have got a place on an architectural course, got the training and got a job. But the chances are that in contemporary Britain he would have been struggling – and might instead have had to join the hordes of black people going overseas in order to get traditional middle-class jobs.</p><h2>'I don't think institutions have changed enough' <br />Helen Oyeyemi Novelist</h2><p>Stephen Lawrence was 18 years old when he was murdered and I was nine. I remember seeing his picture on the news all the time and hearing my mum talk about what his mother would be going through.

I made a speech about [the case] in the House of Commons in 1993 and it has been amazing to me how it has become such a mainstream cause. Because when Stephen died, initially, no one was interested. The family went to court and lost, and they asked the government for an inquiry and didn't get one. But you had a couple of things coming together. First of all there was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/16/doreen-lawrence-minority-students-prospects\" title=\"\">Doreen Lawrence,</a> who was incredibly persistent in asking for justice. Then, before the 1997 election, we took Doreen to see [then home secretary] <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/jackstraw\" title=\"\">Jack Straw.</a> He started out being sceptical – the police had told him there was no case for an inquiry – but he was really impressed and he did deliver.</p><p>That's what made the case special – the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">inquiry</a> that revealed what we all knew, that there was systemic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime7\" title=\"\">institutional racism</a> in the police force.

The Stephen Lawrence case was like a freeze frame, showing something a lot of people knew about, but which had not been taken seriously before.</p><p>I don't think it necessarily changed British society and I wouldn't say the Stephen Lawrence case made people go into politics. People had been campaigning for years on these issues, including racism in the police. The society we live in today is a result of at least three generations of campaigners. Nor did it make it easier to campaign against racism  partly because there was an immediate backlash from the police, who complained, and continue to complain, that their hands are tied in dealing with black criminals. But it was a brief moment when the mainstream said: \"Yes, we understand what you are talking about.\"</p><p>What's disturbing to me is how quickly people have slipped back into old ways. I went <a href=\"http://www.blackeducation.info/news/press/news.aspx?p=102592\" title=\"\">around Hackney in the days after the riots</a> and people said it was about the way they were treated by the police. Sadly, in a recession, and with cutbacks and austerity, people look for a scapegoat and I think racism and anti-immigrant feeling has reared its ugly head again. Some of the narrative about immigration is very unnerving. Also the [reaction to the case] in some ways has reinforced a post-racist narrative, but that's not my experience or the experience of my friends and their children.</p><h2>'I'm not willing to accept things that are racist now'<br />Ashley Walters, actor</h2><p>It was a huge shock for me when I heard about Stephen Lawrence's murder. I was very young and had never heard of someone being murdered for the colour of their skin. Later, when I was still quite young, I was in a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283498/\" title=\"\">film</a> about Stephen Lawrence, directed by Paul Greengrass. Doreen Lawrence was on set a lot and it was not that long after the murder. It made me feel that I must make something of myself because your life can be taken away so easily.</p><p>I do think society has changed since the murder. People understand that there are those who feel so bad about other races that they are willing to kill. This has helped in dealing with racism in all areas – <a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/\" title=\"\">football</a>, the workplace and the media. It was a tragic event but it has pushed society to challenge itself.</p><p>Personally, in my work, I am now not as willing as I was before to accept things that I know are racist. It's quite easy in the workplace to brush it off because you just want to get on, and you don't want to be a problem. But something like this makes you realise you have to stand up for your rights, because it is not just about you but the people who come after you.</p><p>I was pleased when the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> came out because I had experienced racism by the police over and over again. I was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/stop-and-search\" title=\"\">stopped and searched</a> regularly – two or three times a week from the time I was 14 onwards – and it became a real issue. Especially for my mum because she spent a lot of time having to pick me up from a police station when I had done nothing wrong. Before the report, young black boys like me felt as if we didn't have a voice. I think it happens less now. Stephen's death wasn't in vain because it meant people had to change.</p><p>But I am still stopped and searched – it happened the other day. I was swarmed by six police who were searching me and holding me. I understand they have a job to do, but it makes me feel really angry – and I get it a lot less than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jan/14/stop-search-racial-profiling-police\" title=\"\">most young black men</a> on the street. I have met a lot of police officers who are trying to make a difference but I think a huge part of the police force holds views that are not right. And I doubt the trust in the police has improved within the black community. I was disgusted by a lot of the behaviour in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> but I can understand a lot of the anger that was bubbling up.</p><p>In terms of the music industry today there are a lot more black actors and black musicians. And I think the Stephen Lawrence case opened doors to things that might have been frowned upon in the past. One example is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/14/so-solid-crew-interview\" title=\"\">So Solid</a>: we had a huge impact and I think people didn't understand us but now you have more artists who lead same way of life that we did.</p><p>In terms of film and TV black actors still don't get the range of parts they should do. Lots of black actors refuse to play gangsters or criminals but then they don't work. I think it's up to black actors and writers to create new parts that are not always set in \"the ends\".</p><p>With my children I am not naive. I know I still have to tell them that they have to be doing better than the best in their class. It's a shame to say it but as a black child the minute you become a problem <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/22/racism-school-exclusions-hugh-muir\" title=\"\">no one is there for you</a> any more. I don't think you should have to say to your child \"make sure you do more than your white friend\", but in the world we live in racism is still there at every level.</p><h2>'I don't think as a society we are less racist' <br />Kele Okereke Musician</h2><p>I felt a biting sadness when I heard Stephen Lawrence had been murdered. I was 12 and it's a wound that hasn't really healed. It was about being made aware that in this land, which is your home, you are still seen as different.</p><p>Then there was the fact that the murder was covered up – and the forces that were there to protect us colluded and conspired to prevent justice happening.</p><p>Growing up not white in Britain, you experience some kind of racism everyday. There are two paths you can take – you can let it enrage you or you can try to ignore it. The Stephen Lawrence murder was something that it was impossible to not feel moved by, but in the years that followed, seeing his mother's reluctance to accept this injustice was something I found incredibly inspiring.</p><p>As a black man growing up in the 90s the findings of the Macpherson report weren't a shock to me. It confirmed what my parents said and my own experiences. I have a friend who worked in the police force in the 70s, and he told me that they had a rhyme which reminded them that if you saw two black youths you would always stop them. This wasn't written down – it was an attitude.</p><p>I don't think as a society we are less racist than 20 years ago, although we may be more careful about putting it on display. At the moment it feels as if political correctness and multiculturalism have become dirty words, and it is a cruel victory of the right that we are not allowed to fight the status quo without being criticised.</p><p>My cousin <a href=\"Christopher Alaneme was killed in 2006 in a racist attack in Kent\" title=\"\">Christopher Alaneme was killed in 2006 in a racist attack in Kent</a>. He was 18 and at the start of his life but it was taken away by hateful people. This is the reality of life in multicultural Britain and it makes me sad.</p><p>Just recently we had the John Terry case, where a high-profile public figure was ostensibly using racist language, and it didn't feel  as if in his industry that there was any kind of backlash from people who support football. It's sad because it suggests to me those kind of ideas aren't a problem in his field.</p><p>Being a person of colour in the music industry isn't easy, nor is it easy being a person of colour in the public eye. In today's media there is a continued portrayal of the black person as being bullish, troublesome and with a chip on their shoulder. But I ask: how are we supposed to feel when violence, discrimination and a relentless negative public image is what we are faced with daily?</p><p>Because of this, now in my 30s, I am starting to notice that there is a growing suspicion in me of the police, of the government, of the media, of all these white-owned and regulated power structures. This is partly fostered by my parents, partly fostered by the experiences of being a young black man in the UK. Although I cannot give way to it, I must recognise it for what it is, because this is how things are in the Britain and will continue to be probably for most of my lifetime.</p><h2>'It changed Britain – it cut across race lines' <br />Estelle Musician</h2><p>I heard about the murder on the day it happened. I was young and I just remember being, like, what? Just the fact that people would hurt someone like that was a huge shock to my system. What resonated with me was that he was so young and walking home from a bus stop and these lads just stabbed the hell out of him. I was nervous for my brothers.</p><p>You would hear about police racism but when the Macpherson report came out, it was shown to be real. I think it's more about society and the way people are raised. My mum raised us to think as individuals and not to judge people but after the report it became more difficult to disagree when my friends said the police were racist.</p><p>I think the case definitely changed Britain – it cut across race lines. It didn't matter if you were black, white or grey, you had to see that it was unfair that this man had been killed. I don't think it made Britain less racist but it stayed on people's minds – especially with the way Mrs Lawrence behaved after the attacks.</p><p>For the past 10 years, what I have taken from it is watching Mrs Lawrence's example. Watching how she has become a symbol for peace rather than being filled with the anger and grief you would expect – that leads me to think about having a higher purpose.</p><p>There are so many questions you could ask about black people on the streets and the police. I have been a victim of it a couple of times, seeing my friends experience stop and search, so for me it is an ongoing issue. It can be someone just doing their job. But it can also, on the other side, be someone trying to carry on with their day that has to deal with it.</p><p>Across the board and across the world, there are problems with racism. I can't redesign the world and say it isn't there. But I don't know what you can do about it apart from taking personal responsibility.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/kele-okereke\">Kele Okereke</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/helen-oyeyemi\">Helen Oyeyemi</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/estelle\">Estelle</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/homa-khaleeli\">Homa Khaleeli</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

On the 20th anniversary of his death we ask Robert Beckford, Helen Oyeyemi, Diane Abbott, Ashley Walters, Kele Okereke and Estelle what impact his death had on them and society</p><h2>'Middle-class hostility has been let off the hook'  <br />Robert Beckford Theologian</h2><p>I was accustomed to racialised attacks on individuals from the black community, so when I first heard about the murder of Stephen Lawrence, it was just one among the many. In Birmingham we had our own catalogue of attacks and a long history of people <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9781000/9781365.stm\" title=\"\">dying in custody</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article157672.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/neville-and-doreen-lawrence-image-2-907880698-157672.jpg\" title=\"\">image of Doreen and Neville Lawrence </a>was profoundly important for black people in Britain. In mainstream public life we tend to see images of black people only when it is to do with sports or entertainment, and images of black families only when it is around questions of immigration. This was a rare moment when black people were represented in a redemptive, even salvific, way. Here were a black man and woman who were trying to deal with their own personal tragedy, but also trying to redeem the nation; a dignified, hard-working couple whose son had aspirations to become an architect and was as close as you can get to the British dream. It pricked the moral conscience.</p><p>But I only really registered the case as being very important when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-jolted-nation-conscience\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela</a> came to Britain two weeks later. That was the moment most people became conscious of its connection with police corruption and racist discourse in the criminal justice system. The case provided us with a moment for reflection – we could have developed very aggressive policies to deal with racism in the workplace and institutional forms of racism, but we didn't. Instead we focused on the racist attack – because we can then blame <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/15/stephen-lawrence-killer-drops-appeal\" title=\"\">poorly educated, working-class white men</a> for racism. When the reality is that for most black people everyday forms of racism are not about people trying to attack you in the street, but instead are in the workplace, in the criminal justice system, in housing and in the micro forms of aggression you can experience when you go shopping. We have allowed the genteel middle-class hostility that most black people experience off the hook. And so it has been possible to maintain disadvantage in the workplace, schooling and public policy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the idea of \"institutional racism\" provided a language for critics of the state, but conversely meant public bodies could adopt the mantle of institional racism, publish the figures – and then do nothing about it, because the legislation didn't provide a sanction.</p><p>In higher education, some made an effort to recruit more black students and think about how to retain black staff. But in general it was really piecemeal and lukewarm. It wasn't the revision that North America went through in response to the civil rights movement, where black studies courses were introduced and they went out of their way to recruit black academics. Consequently, there hasn't been any major development post-Macpherson – we are in the same position as in the 1990s. And you could quite easily say we have gone backwards since the 1970s in creating a black intellectual class.</p><p>The black church tradition has changed, however. There was always a tension between the people on the streets and the people in the pews about the way forward for black Britons. The people on the streets would argue that society is racist and there are very limited opportunities for black people to progress, while the church argued that with hard work and discipline you could thrive in Britain's so-called meritocracy. After the murder it became easier for people on the streets to talk about racial disadvantage, racial attacks, corrupt policing and a faulty criminal justice system and get a hearing inside the church, which is the only nationwide institution within the black community.</p><p>Today, I think my students [at Canterbury Christ Church University] are more concerned with whether they can afford their education and get a decent job. And the reality for many black and Asian students is navigating an employment regime that is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/04/graduates-ethnic-minority\" title=\"\">weighted against them</a>. They have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover\" title=\"\">names and ethnicities</a> that are always the last to be hired and first to be fired in Britain. There is a great deal of underemployment among black and Asian graduates compared with their counterparts.</p><p>The myth about Stephen Lawrence is that he would have got a place on an architectural course, got the training and got a job. But the chances are that in contemporary Britain he would have been struggling – and might instead have had to join the hordes of black people going overseas in order to get traditional middle-class jobs.</p><h2>'I don't think institutions have changed enough' <br />Helen Oyeyemi Novelist</h2><p>Stephen Lawrence was 18 years old when he was murdered and I was nine. I remember seeing his picture on the news all the time and hearing my mum talk about what his mother would be going through. He went to a local school where kids from my primary school went, so it was very immediate.</p><p>Because the case went on for so long, awareness of it grew and grew. It worked its way into the nation's consciousness and he became a bigger figure for me too.

There were all these men in black suits looking very grave and dignified, waiting in a line outside – as if they were guarding, or protecting, the memory of him. My mum said they were Americans but no one really knew who they were – so there was a mystique, and also the idea that people outside of England cared and that the world was grieving over this loss.

Nor did it make it easier to campaign against racism  partly because there was an immediate backlash from the police, who complained, and continue to complain, that their hands are tied in dealing with black criminals. But it was a brief moment when the mainstream said: \"Yes, we understand what you are talking about.\"</p><p>What's disturbing to me is how quickly people have slipped back into old ways. I went <a href=\"http://www.blackeducation.info/news/press/news.aspx?p=102592\" title=\"\">around Hackney in the days after the riots</a> and people said it was about the way they were treated by the police. Sadly, in a recession, and with cutbacks and austerity, people look for a scapegoat and I think racism and anti-immigrant feeling has reared its ugly head again. Some of the narrative about immigration is very unnerving. Also the [reaction to the case] in some ways has reinforced a post-racist narrative, but that's not my experience or the experience of my friends and their children.</p><h2>'I'm not willing to accept things that are racist now'<br />Ashley Walters, actor</h2><p>It was a huge shock for me when I heard about Stephen Lawrence's murder. I was very young and had never heard of someone being murdered for the colour of their skin. Later, when I was still quite young, I was in a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283498/\" title=\"\">film</a> about Stephen Lawrence, directed by Paul Greengrass. Doreen Lawrence was on set a lot and it was not that long after the murder. It made me feel that I must make something of myself because your life can be taken away so easily.</p><p>I do think society has changed since the murder. People understand that there are those who feel so bad about other races that they are willing to kill. This has helped in dealing with racism in all areas – <a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/\" title=\"\">football</a>, the workplace and the media. It was a tragic event but it has pushed society to challenge itself.</p><p>Personally, in my work, I am now not as willing as I was before to accept things that I know are racist. It's quite easy in the workplace to brush it off because you just want to get on, and you don't want to be a problem. But something like this makes you realise you have to stand up for your rights, because it is not just about you but the people who come after you.</p><p>I was pleased when the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> came out because I had experienced racism by the police over and over again. I was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/stop-and-search\" title=\"\">stopped and searched</a> regularly – two or three times a week from the time I was 14 onwards – and it became a real issue. Especially for my mum because she spent a lot of time having to pick me up from a police station when I had done nothing wrong. Before the report, young black boys like me felt as if we didn't have a voice. I think it happens less now. Stephen's death wasn't in vain because it meant people had to change.</p><p>But I am still stopped and searched – it happened the other day. I was swarmed by six police who were searching me and holding me. I understand they have a job to do, but it makes me feel really angry – and I get it a lot less than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jan/14/stop-search-racial-profiling-police\" title=\"\">most young black men</a> on the street. I have met a lot of police officers who are trying to make a difference but I think a huge part of the police force holds views that are not right. And I doubt the trust in the police has improved within the black community. I was disgusted by a lot of the behaviour in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">riots</a> but I can understand a lot of the anger that was bubbling up.</p><p>In terms of the music industry today there are a lot more black actors and black musicians. And I think the Stephen Lawrence case opened doors to things that might have been frowned upon in the past. One example is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/14/so-solid-crew-interview\" title=\"\">So Solid</a>: we had a huge impact and I think people didn't understand us but now you have more artists who lead same way of life that we did.</p><p>In terms of film and TV black actors still don't get the range of parts they should do. Lots of black actors refuse to play gangsters or criminals but then they don't work. I think it's up to black actors and writers to create new parts that are not always set in \"the ends\".</p><p>With my children I am not naive. I know I still have to tell them that they have to be doing better than the best in their class. It's a shame to say it but as a black child the minute you become a problem <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/22/racism-school-exclusions-hugh-muir\" title=\"\">no one is there for you</a> any more. I don't think you should have to say to your child \"make sure you do more than your white friend\", but in the world we live in racism is still there at every level.</p><h2>'I don't think as a society we are less racist' <br />Kele Okereke Musician</h2><p>I felt a biting sadness when I heard Stephen Lawrence had been murdered. I was 12 and it's a wound that hasn't really healed. It was about being made aware that in this land, which is your home, you are still seen as different.</p><p>Then there was the fact that the murder was covered up – and the forces that were there to protect us colluded and conspired to prevent justice happening.</p><p>Growing up not white in Britain, you experience some kind of racism everyday. There are two paths you can take – you can let it enrage you or you can try to ignore it. The Stephen Lawrence murder was something that it was impossible to not feel moved by, but in the years that followed, seeing his mother's reluctance to accept this injustice was something I found incredibly inspiring.</p><p>As a black man growing up in the 90s the findings of the Macpherson report weren't a shock to me. It confirmed what my parents said and my own experiences. I have a friend who worked in the police force in the 70s, and he told me that they had a rhyme which reminded them that if you saw two black youths you would always stop them. This wasn't written down – it was an attitude.</p><p>I don't think as a society we are less racist than 20 years ago, although we may be more careful about putting it on display. At the moment it feels as if political correctness and multiculturalism have become dirty words, and it is a cruel victory of the right that we are not allowed to fight the status quo without being criticised.</p><p>My cousin <a href=\"Christopher Alaneme was killed in 2006 in a racist attack in Kent\" title=\"\">Christopher Alaneme was killed in 2006 in a racist attack in Kent</a>. He was 18 and at the start of his life but it was taken away by hateful people. This is the reality of life in multicultural Britain and it makes me sad.</p><p>Just recently we had the John Terry case, where a high-profile public figure was ostensibly using racist language, and it didn't feel  as if in his industry that there was any kind of backlash from people who support football. It's sad because it suggests to me those kind of ideas aren't a problem in his field.</p><p>Being a person of colour in the music industry isn't easy, nor is it easy being a person of colour in the public eye. In today's media there is a continued portrayal of the black person as being bullish, troublesome and with a chip on their shoulder. But I ask: how are we supposed to feel when violence, discrimination and a relentless negative public image is what we are faced with daily?</p><p>Because of this, now in my 30s, I am starting to notice that there is a growing suspicion in me of the police, of the government, of the media, of all these white-owned and regulated power structures. This is partly fostered by my parents, partly fostered by the experiences of being a young black man in the UK. Although I cannot give way to it, I must recognise it for what it is, because this is how things are in the Britain and will continue to be probably for most of my lifetime.</p><h2>'It changed Britain – it cut across race lines' <br />Estelle Musician</h2><p>I heard about the murder on the day it happened. I was young and I just remember being, like, what? Just the fact that people would hurt someone like that was a huge shock to my system. What resonated with me was that he was so young and walking home from a bus stop and these lads just stabbed the hell out of him. I was nervous for my brothers.</p><p>You would hear about police racism but when the Macpherson report came out, it was shown to be real. I think it's more about society and the way people are raised. My mum raised us to think as individuals and not to judge people but after the report it became more difficult to disagree when my friends said the police were racist.</p><p>I think the case definitely changed Britain – it cut across race lines. It didn't matter if you were black, white or grey, you had to see that it was unfair that this man had been killed. I don't think it made Britain less racist but it stayed on people's minds – especially with the way Mrs Lawrence behaved after the attacks.</p><p>For the past 10 years, what I have taken from it is watching Mrs Lawrence's example. Watching how she has become a symbol for peace rather than being filled with the anger and grief you would expect – that leads me to think about having a higher purpose.</p><p>There are so many questions you could ask about black people on the streets and the police. I have been a victim of it a couple of times, seeing my friends experience stop and search, so for me it is an ongoing issue. It can be someone just doing their job. But it can also, on the other side, be someone trying to carry on with their day that has to deal with it.</p><p>Across the board and across the world, there are problems with racism. I can't redesign the world and say it isn't there. But I don't know what you can do about it apart from taking personal responsibility.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/diane-abbott\">Diane Abbott</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/kele-okereke\">Kele Okereke</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/helen-oyeyemi\">Helen Oyeyemi</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/estelle\">Estelle</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/homa-khaleeli\">Homa Khaleeli</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
