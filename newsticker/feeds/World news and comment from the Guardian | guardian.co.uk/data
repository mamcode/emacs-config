The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As it charts his journey from provincial joker to maverick statesman, Benvenuto Presidente! has given viewers some much needed laughs at a time when real-life politics is every bit as strange as fiction, but certainly not as funny.</p><p>On Thursday, seven weeks after elections that resulted in little more than unbreakable gridlock, more than 1,000 politicians are due to gather in the lower house of parliament to start the process of electing a new president to replace Giorgio Napolitano, the widely respected former communist who, at the age of 87, has come to the end of his seven-year term.</p><p>The choice of a new head of state is always important, but this time, as the clock ticks and there is still no new government, it is crucial. It will be up to Napolitano's successor to see whether bickering politicians can be cajoled into forming a government or whether a return to the polls is the only way forward. Even for those with rather more political experience than Peppino, the challenge is daunting.</p><p>\"This election is extremely important because the president of the republic is in office for seven long years without interruption,\" said Gianfranco Pasquino, a leftwing political scientist and former senator. \"He has the power first to appoint the prime minister and second to dissolve parliament, so he is a very powerful man, especially because the [political] parties are very weak and there is no majority for any party or any single coalition.\"</p><p>Although a largely symbolic office, the Italian presidency has been likened to a concertina that can expand and contract according to need. In the past year and a half that need has been greater than ever. When Silvio Berlusconi's government collapsed in November 2011 it was Napolitano who drafted in Mario Monti and invited the economist to form a technocratic government.</p><p>In the long and anguished aftermath of February's election, \"King George\", as he has been dubbed by the media, has once again played a central role. But, due to constitutional restrictions on the powers of a president in his final six months in office, he has not been able to dissolve parliament and call new elections. So all eyes will be on his successor – but quite who that will be remains unclear.</p><p>What is always an obscure process cloaked in intrigue has become even more so this year as the presidency becomes a bargaining chip in the battle for a government. Any candidate will need broad support; in the first three rounds a two-thirds majority is needed, while thereafter the requirement falls to a simple majority.</p><p>It had been hoped that, if a president were elected with the backing of both Pier Luigi Bersani's centre-left and Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right, the path to some form of new government might potentially run more smoothly. But , as Bersani threw his support behind Franco Marini, a prominent Catholic in the Democratic party (PD) and former speaker of the senate, the supposed \"consensus\" candidate immediately appeared to expose the deep faultlines within his own party.</p><p>While backed by Berlusconi's bloc and Monti's centrists, Marini's candidacy was vehemently opposed by Bersani's chief leadership rival, Matteo Renzi, who had already slated Marini earlier in the week and who declared last night that his presidency would do a \"disservice\" to the country.</p><p>There was speculation that elements of the centre-left unhappy with Marini could back the candidate of Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment Five Star Movement, Stefano Rodotà, a leftwing professor of law. The M5S had originally backed investigative journalist, Milena Gabanelli, but she politely but firmly declined.</p><p>Francesco Clementi, a constitutional expert and professor of law at the University of Perugia, said the election – which is carried out by secret ballot – would be a gauge of the various divisions in the PD. \"This will be a very interesting, very strange election in which we will be able to check the influences within the party,\" he said.  Among the other names suggested as potential candidates have been Giuliano Amato, a respected former prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, who in 1998 became the first former Communist to become prime minister of a Nato country, and Sergio Mattarella, a former deputy prime minister under D'Alema who is now a judge in Italy's constitutional court. Former prime minister Romano Prodi, championed by many on the centre-left, was dismissed outright by Berlusconi, who lost two elections to him.All predictions are made with caution. Observers compare the presidential election to the papal conclave and say that, just as he who is dubbed the greatest <em>papabile</em> usually exits a cardinal, so frontrunners for the Quirinale palace tend not to emerge as president-elect. The process can also be as lengthy as a conclave: while two presidents have been chosen with lightening speed on the first ballot, it ran to 16 rounds in 1992 and 23 in 1971.</p><p>Many Italians are watching the election with scepticism. Near the Quirinale, Tonino Giardini, a consultant, said on Tuesday that none of the potential candidates inspired much faith. \"We don't have anyone on Napolitano's level,\" he said. \"I'm looking, but I can't see anyone.\"</p><p>Over coffee in a nearby bar, Paolo Ganino, a 27-year-old journalism student based in London, bemoaned the paralysis. \"We need a government. I came back from England to vote to have a government, and I still don't have it. I have the government that was appointed by the president and not voted by anyone that is still in charge,\" he laughed, bitterly. Will the new president, whoever he or she is, be able to change much? Ganino, a PD voter, was not hopeful, suspecting that fresh elections would be on the cards before the year's end. \"It's a very difficult situation. I'm really into politics,\" he said. \"But I do not see a way out.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy\">Italy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi\">Silvio Berlusconi</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mario-monti\">Mario Monti</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italian-elections-2013\">Italian elections 2013</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizzydavies\">Lizzy Davies</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems.

In Liverpool, the radical bookshop News from Nowhere said party packs – containing black balloons and party poppers with the politician's face on and bearing the legend: \"Still hate Thatcher\" – sold out in two days.</p><p>In Scotland, trade unionists and socialists were due to hold a rally on Wednesday evening to remember the \"industries and communities who suffered\" under her government\".</p><p>In London, protest organisers had called for people to silently turn their back on Thatcher's coffin. But as it came into view at 10.45am, there were shouts of \"What a waste of money\" and \"Tory scum\". Similar shouts at other points on the route were drowned out by pro-Thatcher clapping.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/17/margaret-thatcher-funeral-turning-my-back\" title=\"\">Rebecca Lush Blum</a> from Hampshire, who set up a Facebook group to organise the protest event on the route at Ludgate Circus, said she was pleased people had been allowed to voice anger at Thatcher's legacy.</p><p>\"We have shown the world that not everyone in this country thinks Margaret Thatcher was a great thing for this country … today felt like an important moment in the battle over what her legacy is and what sort of country we want so I'm pleased our voice was heard.\"</p><p>Police had told Blum the protest could go ahead and by 9.30am about 100 people had gathered at the normally busy junction in central London. As the first ceremonial military band went past just before 10am, there were boos and chants from protesters. Thatcher supporters – including one man wearing a suit and Thatcher T-shirt on a balcony overlooking the crowd – clapped and cheered.</p><p>Numbers of protesters swelled and by the time the coffin went by, police at the scene estimated there were about 300 protesters. The atmosphere was tense, with military personnel gathered at the other side of the road, clapping and cheering.</p><p>Dave Winslow, 22, an anthropology student from Durham – who was holding a placard reading \"Rest of us in Poverty\" and wearing a T-shirt with the messages \"Power to the people\" and \"Society does exist\" – was one of those who wanted a silent protest.</p><p>\"We want to maintain a dignified protest,\" he said. \"It's counterproductive to catcall and sing Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead. The message is that spending £10m on such a divisive figure in times of austerity, especially when austerity is being imposed on the poor, is wrong, especially when harm is being caused to the disabled and the NHS.\"</p><p>There was a big police presence with \"liaison officers\" mingling with the crowd and armed police guarding the barriers along the route. Surveillance officers took up positions on surrounding buildings.</p><p>Once the coffin had passed, some protesters were visibly moved. One man, who did not want to give his name, had tears in his eyes. He said: \"She ruined my family's life. She took my dad's job, everything … I promised myself I would come here for this day years ago.\"</p><p>Julie Guest, who had been in Iraq in 1998, said she pledged she would come when she saw a six-year-old Iraqi boy die because sanctions had stopped him getting medical treatment.</p><p>\"The consequences of her policies have spread a long way in this country and abroad and I said to myself when I saw that boy die that I would remember him when this day came.\"</p><p>The funeral procession passed within a few minutes and the crowd began to disperse. Police confirmed there were no arrests.</p><p>Blum, who had been besieged by media since an article about her planned protest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/14/thatcher-funeral-protesters-police\" title=\"\">appeared in the Guardian on Monday</a>, said she was pleased and moved by what had happened.</p><p>\"It's provocative to have a state funeral for such a controversial politician, and I wanted to remember and respect all those who suffered under Margaret Thatcher. I think we did that today.\"</p><p>A few miles south of St Paul's Cathedral, a group of 19- to 25-year-olds were discussing her legacy at Kids Company, a charity based in south London. Outside, the traffic was perhaps more modest than usual but otherwise it felt like a normal day. \"If it was Tony Blair, it might mean more to people,\" said Amee, 20. Still, she said, we are living in the world Thatcher created. \"Because of what she did, our benefits are dropping. Average working people can't afford to have a mortgage. Soon everything is going to belong to private companies. I look at my three-year-old and wonder how I'm going to put him through school.\"</p><p>\"If I have any respect for her it's because she was a fierce leader,\" said Monique, 21. \"She was decisive and stuck to her beliefs. Most politicians today are wishy-washy but she kept her word.\" Amee added: \"She did a lot to affect the whole system and how it works. She is still in the system even though she is out of power; even though she is dead.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest\">Protest</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matthewtaylor\">Matthew Taylor</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullewis\">Paul Lewis</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil. Let's kill them all\" after the attacks, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/muslims-are-evil-lets-kill-them-all-us-tv-commentator-erik-rush-provokes-furious-reaction-with-boston-bombing-twitter-rants-8575176.html\">provoking a furious reaction on Twitter</a>. Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Witnesses told police the driver had warned them there was a problem, as the coach veered off the road and smashed into overhanging rocks. Some passengers escaped from the burning vehicle by breaking the windows and jumping out. The survivors were flown back to the UK on Wednesday on a specially chartered flight that left Grenoble airport at around 16.00 local time.</p><p>The driver, who worked for Classic Coaches, based in Country Durham, was transporting 53 people from the Alpine resort of Alpe d'Huez back to the UK. The steep and winding road, known as the Route Napoléon, links Cannes with Grenoble through the Alps. With its 21 bends it is often used as one of the stages of the celebrated Tour de France cycle race.</p><p>Jean Rampon, director of the local prefect's office, said: \"The bus was descending and the drive had the time to warn the passengers that he had a problem with the brakes. He hit the rocks and the bus caught fire.\"</p><p>Transport minister Frédéric Cuvillier visited the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening and praised the \"remarkable courage\" of the driver, whose action, he said, had \"saved many lives\". He said the position of the vehicle suggested the driver had tried to slow the vehicle down by hitting the rock rather than risking it veering off the road into a ravine.</p><p>\"The driver showed remarkable courage. The witnesses all agree that his acts and his attitude meant a much heavier loss of life was avoided,\" Cuvillier said.</p><p>The Grenoble public prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat said it appeared \"very probable that this was a problem with the brakes\".</p><p>\"Now the question is why and it will be a long inquiry,\" he told journalists.</p><p>Several hours after the accident, the burned-out coach could be seen hanging over the edge of the mountain road. Empty and charred suitcases along with clothes and personal belongings were scattered around.</p><p>The passengers were said to be \"seasonal ski workers\" aged around 25 returning to Britain after the resorts closed. Around 100,000 seasonal workers make the annual pilgrimage to the northern Alpine region.</p><p>\"When we arrived, people had got out (of the vehicle) by themselves,\" said one rescuer who said it was a scene of panic with passengers screaming and crying.</p><p>The driver was killed, and three other passengers seriously injured. A further 26 were described as slightly injured\". The remainder escaped unharmed. A woman who was seriously burned has been taken to the specialist burns unit at the Edouard Herriot hospital in the city of Lyon. The two other injured passengers are in the general hospital at Grenoble, one in intensive care and the other in a surgical ward.</p><p>In total, 80 firefighters in 30 vehicles and 45 gendarmes were mobilised.</p><p>The most serious recent coach accident in the Alps was in July 2007, when 26 Polish pilgrims were killed and 14 others injured when their vehicle crashed and caught fire in a ravine at Vizille in the Isere after leaving the road.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport\">Road transport</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france\">France</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kim-willsher\">Kim Willsher</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They include members of the New IRA's political wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement.</p><p>Several hundred people attended the party, with the police keeping a discreet distance from the crowds, the majority of whom were young men in their twenties and teens.</p><p>There have been outbreaks of rioting following previous Thatcher-death parties. But youth workers and residents on the Fountain estate said they were just praying the day of Thatcher's funeral would pass quickly.</p><p>Inside the Cathedral Youth Club, within sight of Derry's ancient walls, Graham Warke and Phillip Jackson said they were dreading Wednesday night, given earlier republican street celebrations. The district has come under attack for six nights in a row.</p><p>\"I just can't wait to get this day over with,\" Warke said. \"Residents here are dreading what will happen later.\"</p><p>Warke played video footage taken on his smartphone of six nights of violent attacks on the small estate. It included very young boys wearing hoodies and football scarves throwing petrol bombs over the city's walls and at police patrols.</p><p>Jackson said most people on the Fountain, a small district covered in union flags that is home to the last 400 Protestant residents on Derry's West Bank, were \"repulsed\" over the celebrations.</p><p>\"People on this estate and in all loyalist parts of Londonderry are asking 'how low can these people go by celebrating someone dying?'\"</p><p>Jackson claimed he saw older men orchestrating the rioting directed at his area. \"Those mocking Mrs Thatcher's death are behaving like animals; it is disgusting the way they get on,\" he added.</p><p>Amid all the hatred expressed against Thatcher, a man who personifies peace and non-violent resistance had arrived in the city.</p><p>The Dalai Lama had come to Derry ahead of a symbolic event leading a cross-community walk across Derry's new Peace Bridge over the river Foyle.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland\">Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/derry\">Derry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/northernireland\">Northern Irish politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dalailama\">Dalai Lama</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald\">Henry McDonald</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chinese bank ICBC ousted Exxon Mobil as the world's biggest company, according to the magazine's 10th annual ranking of the world's top 2,000 firms. China Construction Bank bumped JP Morgan out of the second spot.</p><p>The US had a total of 543 members in the list this year, 19 more firms than last year and the highest total since 2009.

Exxon, last year's No 1, slipped into fourth place this year behind the two Chinese firms, JP Morgan and General Electric. Apple eclipsed Exxon as the most valuable company by market capitalization last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/25/exxon-apple-most-valuable-stock\">and the two have vied for pole position ever since</a>. Apple slipped behind Exxon once more on Wednesday.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said. Simons said he expected Congress would have to address the imbalance and that the ruling was likely to lead to more not less litigation.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royaldutchshell\">Royal Dutch Shell</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy\">US foreign policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I intensely disliked the Ba'ath party and most of the ministers who formed the government then. So I have no bias towards the Ba'ath and the president who took over from his father. The trouble is that most of the reporting from Syria comes from sources stationed among the insurgents, who include, for example, the Jabhat al-Nusra, which has just declared its loyalty to al-Qaida, and extremist Sunnis opposed to the Alawites, the president's sect, and have anti-democratic and anti-western views. They don't enjoy support from minorities like the Christians and the Ismailis.</p><p>At last the Guardian has a man in Damascus and can report the regime's version.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/syrian-minister-uk-france-al-qaida?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> Ian Black</a> (15 April) is sensibly cautious. His account of the bombing which damaged the central bank clearly suggests that the bomb came from the insurgents; and more frankly he says that another bomb, killing 80 people, exploded near a Ba'ath headquarters and was blamed on Jabhat al-Nusra. Why our government can help the French to fight al-Qaida in Mali and simultaneously send assistance to its supporters in Syria is difficult to understand. We should be neutral and keep far away from the Syrian struggle.<br /><strong>James Craig</strong><br /><em>Standlake, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Much of your reporting on Syria could have been written by GW Bush: the same old rebels are good, the Syrian government is bad recipe. The Syrian reality seems a little simpler. Syria is crawling with foreign jihadists and it would be exceedingly naive to assume that the special forces of the countries supplying the weapons are not there also – France, the US, UK, various Arab despots?</p><p>Meanwhile, most Syrians in Syria want the killing to stop so they can live their lives without fear. They wanted a negotiated settlement from the Kofi Annan plan, but this was flagrantly obstructed and torpedoed by the west. For Syria read Libya.  <br /><strong>Khalid Mahmood-Chohan</strong><br /><em>Watford, Hertfordshire</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida\">al-Qaida</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Evidence released by the Venezuelan government includes an email sent from Armando Briquet, of Capriles's campaign team, to Guillermo Salas, of Esdata, which reports on Venezuela's electoral process, stating \"we need everything set out in Washington for checking over by the [Capriles campaign] (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/venezuela-opposition-protest-maduro-victory?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 17 April). It's necessary that all documentation is presented if we decide to take the road of not recognising the results\". Nicolas Maduro won Sunday's elections by 1.8%, 262,000 votes. Capriles only won the governorship of Miranda in December last year by 40,000 votes, and both sides accepted the results and the transparency of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council. Chávez lost the constitutional reform referendum in 2007 by a narrower margin, 1.4%, and accepted the result. With a turnout of just under 79%, the results mean 40% of the Venezuelan electorate voted for Maduro, more than Thatcher in 1979 (33%), Blair in 1997 (31%), Cameron in 2010 (23%), Obama in 2008 (30%) and Attlee in 1945 (36%).

There are a number of areas that urgently need to be addressed. First, how is it that none of these banking issues appear to have been identified by the auditors, in their \"going concern\" assessments. Is it reasonable to expect regulators to know more about what is going on inside an organisation than an auditor? Regulators can help protect consumer interests through pricing regulation but, if they are really involved with detailed internal process assessment, what are the auditors doing? Perhaps the auditing function should also have a formal responsibility to customers, as well as to shareholders.</p><p>Second, there is scope for a major investigation into how banks actually add value to society. In essence, the sectors' profits and bonuses are ultimately paid for by their customers.</p><p>Third, there is a need to investigate the extent to which \"selling\" is, almost by definition, unprofessional. The concept of being professional should mean that the interests of the customer/client come first. Where the seller operates within an incentive structure that benefits both the seller and others in their organisation, the net result will almost inevitably be defined as mis-selling.</p><p>The horrific consequences that have arisen in such areas as PPI etc, probably also apply to much of the pay-day loan industry, as well as a significant part of international lending. A major inquiry into the nature and future of the finance sector is long overdue, but there are also many important questions urgently in need of further research.<br /><strong>Emeritus professor Bruce Lloyd</strong><br /><em>South Bank University</em></p><p></p><p>• It is obvious many of the top executives of the failed banks had no actual financial expertise; they are like someone pretending to be a doctor, or a fake architect whose buildings collapse, guilty of misrepresentation. The regulator may be surprised no bank bosses have faced charges – we all are. <br /><strong>Tony Cheney</strong><br /><em>Ipswich, Suffolk </em></p><p></p><p>• As a research and advocacy group that has for years called attention to the murky world of tax havens, we welcome your report (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/03/offshore-secrets-offshore-tax-haven?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Leaks reveal secrets of the rich who hide cash offshore</a>, 4 April). But you should also have dispelled the myth advocated by some proponents that tax havens promote greater tax efficiency through competition; the evidence in economic literature is scanty at best. What is clear is that this benefit has not been enough to prevent tax havens from going bankrupt.</p><p>In September 2009, the Cayman Islands, one of the largest, faced bankruptcy and was unable to pay its government employees. Britain, which oversees the territory, was forced to bail out the Cayman authorities. Recently, Cyprus went belly up and had to be rescued by the EU, ECB, and IMF.</p><p>Investors need to realise that the lack of prudential regulations and oversight allows tax havens to pass on the cost-savings to them as higher returns. But with higher returns come higher risks. They implicitly accepted those risks when they invested in tax havens. In the event the financial risks pile up – as they inevitably must – and the house of cards comes crashing down, investors should not expect taxpayers to foot the bill. <br /><strong>Dev Kar</strong><br /><em>Lead economist, </em><a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Financial Integrity</em></a><em>, Washington DC</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking\">Banking</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/caymanislands\">Cayman Islands</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus\">Cyprus</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The sun is out and, despite the blasting wind, the bite in the air has departed. After a delay of a month the energy is now bursting out and Titchmarsh Wood is springing into life. Among the small oaks, blossoming sallow and hazel coppice, great tits, chiffchaffs, bullfinches, redpoll, and many other small birds urgently broadcast their individual churrs, cheeps and twitters. The recent weather must have been immensely trying for the resident birds; many will have perished as they struggled to maintain body heat on intermittent invertebrate food supplies. The survivors, joined by recent arrivals from transcontinental travels, sound like they are making up for lost time.</p><p>Splashes of primroses colour the verges but the trees are still in bud. Only the most sheltered blackthorn bushes are in bud burst; blossom and leaves breaking out at the same moment. The bluebells and patches of wild garlic are in leaf but nowhere near being in flower. For weeks I have been scanning for brimstone butterflies, the little fluttering yellow flags that would signal the end of the reign of white. Today the brimstones are out, careering up and down the rides. Peacocks and small tortoiseshells are also active, some feeding on yellow puffs of sallow blossom. Portly queen bumblebees pipe up sallow nectar and burn off the sugar flying low over the ground, hunting for suitable small mammal burrows in which to establish their nests. The insects are back, the numbers are perhaps low, but after their long hibernation it is good to see and hear them again.</p><p>The ground is waterlogged and the path churned; overhead are the plaintive cries of a pair of buzzards and a pair of red kites. The soaring, diving and banking birds of prey wheel in the sky as if acting out an aerial dogfight. As with the finches, warblers and tits, the race is on to secure the choicest nesting spots and feeding territories. The lines for another breeding season are being drawn.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs\">Rural affairs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/birds\">Birds</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/animals\">Animals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/insects\">Insects</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-shardlow\">Matt Shardlow</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Still, academics and journalists need each other</p><p>It's a good thing the BBC did not send its undercover reporter to North Korea with a group of students from Oxford University. Otherwise Oxford's chancellor, Chris Patten, would have had to send a strongly worded letter of protest to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Chris Patten. \"I cannot understand how you could allow …\"</p><p>I refer, of course, to the row about journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/why-is-lse-making-fuss-over-panorama\" title=\"\">John Sweeney travelling to North Korea</a> with a group of students from the London School of Economics on undercover assignment for the BBC's Panorama. Compared with working out if there is a real threat of nuclear war from the world's last full-dress totalitarian state, this may seem like a storm in a British teacup. But it prompts us to reflect on how we can discover what nasty, secretive regimes are up to, without sacrificing our own values and endangering others along the way.</p><p>As someone who has spent a good chunk of his life trying to do just that, in&nbsp;journalism and in academia, I've been&nbsp;interested in responses on both sides of the academia-journalism fence. I start from a strong sympathy with the undercover reporter. We owe no duty of&nbsp;honesty to tyrants. There is nothing to compare with being there, on the spot. The first article I ever published was a report based on joining a \"Progressive Tour\" to Albania, then suffering under a totalitarian regime with a strong resemblance to today's North Korea. If Sweeney had embedded himself in one of the tours that travel regularly to North Korea, as other journalists have, he would deserve only praise. But he didn't, and no one comes out of this story very well.</p><p>The LSE had legitimate grounds for concern. It seems that a few of those on the trip had not been told about their journalistic accompaniment. The&nbsp;students subsequently received bullying emails from a North Korean official, threatening to publish their \"personal data\" because they had broken North Korean law. If any of them&nbsp;wanted to pursue an academic career in North Korean studies, this would not be a good start. But the LSE's highly public reaction was over the top, and arguably counterproductive.</p><p>The BBC's expert prior assessment, which concluded that the students risked at most brief detention and expulsion, was probably about right. The LSE made virtually no acknowledgement of the genuine public interest in such a journalistic investigation. Its <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9994533/LSE-BBCs-Panorama-decision-extremely-regrettable.html\" title=\"\">call for the programme not to be broadcast</a> at all was ridiculous. Its thermonuclear response must draw the attention of every authoritarian regime to the journalistic worm that might be hidden in any LSE study group. A strong private protest to the BBC would have been best.</p><p>The BBC exhibited that proclivity for weak and contorted compromise that seems to be a hallmark of its recent management. If it had got written, informed consent from everyone on the trip, as its own editorial guidelines suggest, then no reasonable person could have complained. \"Students are adults, after all,\" as a former head of Oxford's department of politics and international relations exclaimed. Instead, most of them seem to have been partially informed, apparently in individual conversations with the reporter's wife (an LSE alumna, who was organising the trip) and the cameraman. But even those students were not fully&nbsp;informed – for their own protection, BBC managers said.</p><p>This is inconsistent and silly. It's the&nbsp;same <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/bbc-caves-thatcher-song-ding-dong\" title=\"\">muddled management style which led to only a tiny clip</a> from Ding&nbsp;Dong! The Witch is Dead, virally&nbsp;promoted online as a posthumous insult to Margaret Thatcher, being&nbsp;played on Radio 1's chart show, together with a spoken explanation of the background. For God's sake, Auntie, make up your mind. Either play the bloody song or don't. Either get the students' consent or don't.</p><p>As for Sweeney Agonistes, one can see why the fact that his wife was organising this trip for an LSE student society was tempting. But a whizz around the BBC website reveals a story posted just five days before the Panorama broadcast, explaining the possibilities of tourism to North Korea. One satisfied customer describes himself as an \"adventure tourist\". An expert on Pyongyang's nuclear programme tells me that when he spoke at a foreign correspondents' club in London, half the journalists in the room seemed to have visited North Korea on such tours.</p><p>Moreover, the value added by the Panorama programme did not match its hype. It was interesting to see what foreigners are shown – a chilly model hospital with no patients, for example – and a few blurry glimpses of what they are not shown: the miserable poor, squatting in ditches. But most of the real insights came from experts and defectors interviewed outside the country. \"So, welcome to the real North Korea\" declared Sweeney dramatically, standing inside a barbed wire fence apparently built to keep ordinary people away from his tour group's hotel. Cut to a long-distance shot of some miserable-looking apartment buildings. But he wasn't in the real North Korea; he was in a Potemkin village inn. Back in downtown Pyongyang, he teetered over the edge into self-parody, intoning \"something's going on … you can feel the tension rising. The problem is, it's impossible for us to ask what's really happening. We don't know.\"</p><p>Contrast this with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/aug/15/nothing-to-envy-barbara-demick\" title=\"\">Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy</a>, which carefully and movingly tells the personal stories of six North Koreans, based on extensive interviews and all other available sources. Demick, a journalist with a decade's experience in the region, makes extensive acknowledgement to fellow correspondents, academics and experts of all kinds. The result is a fantastic book, which gives us some of the truth that North Korea's progressive tour guides are paid to hide. Moral of the story? It's precisely in those secretive, nasty places that real knowledge only comes from years of hard work by journalists and academics alike, sharing the fruits of their complementary crafts.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timothygartonash\">Timothy Garton Ash</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There will be road-blocks everywhere.\"</p><p>But pro-democracy protesters opposed to Sunday's race have also been frustrated by increased security measures which have driven them out of the capital, Manama. Shehabi said: \"There was a blanket ban on all protests after last year's grand prix. People have been forced underground now. Protesters have been pushed to parts of small villages where they can't be heard or seen. As long as you're not seen or heard by anyone it's OK.</p><p>\"There is a continuation of government repression. We haven't seen justice or accountability for the F1 staff who were sacked and arrested and tortured in 2011. They were tortured at the circuit itself.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Jean Todt, president of the FIA, Formula One's governing body, has at last broken his silence in a letter to local NGOs concerning the Bahrain Grand Prix. In it, he said: \"It is our firm belief that sport, and the F1 grand prix, can have a positive and healing effect in situations where conflict, social unrest and tensions are causing distress.\"</p><p>Shehabi said: \"We have asked for 200 tickets for the race so protesters can make their point peacefully. But we won't be allowed within a mile of the circuit.\"</p><p>Said Yousif, spokesman for the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, said: \"There has been a government crackdown here and it started two weeks ago, especially in the villages close to the F1 track, and 65 people have been arrested.  Leaders have been beaten and tortured before being released, so everyone can see the marks of beating and torture. Houses have been razed in different villages. Tear gas has been used at close range. No one has died, as happened last year, but the crackdown has continued. I was in jail for a month three months ago just because I tweeted an injury in the capital.\"</p><p>Sheikh Ali Salman, leader of the Shia Muslim-led group al-Wefaq, has asked for an increase in peaceful protests. \"I am calling for more peaceful protests,\" he said. \"I am calling on people to share peaceful protests to send a message to the world about our demand for peaceful democratic reform. I am against violence. Our protest is to take place today, tomorrow and on Friday. It is not against the race itself.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formula-one-2013\">Formula One 2013</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bahrain\">Bahrain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/motorsports\">Motor sport</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulweaver\">Paul Weaver</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination,\" he told a local television channel after the discovery of the bodies of Mike and Cynthia McLelland at their home in a town east of Dallas on 30 March. They had been shot multiple times. Williams wished the police luck. \"I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act,\" he said.</p><p>The authorities now think they have the culprits. In the early hours of Wednesday, Williams' wife, Kim, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/texas-da-murders-justice-wife-arrested\">was arrested and charged with the murders of the McLellands and another prosecutor, Mark Hasse, in January</a>. According to her arrest warrant, she identified her husband as the shooter. He was already in the Kaufman County jail on a $3m bond, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/13/texas-da-murder-arrest-threat\">accused of sending an anonymous email containing a \"terroristic threat\"</a>.</p><p>Investigators had met Eric Williams in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant near his home in Kaufman, taken his cellphone and swabbed his hands to test for gun residue. His then-attorney repeatedly maintained that <a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2013/04/03/i-team-former-kaufman-co-official-talks-about-his-involvement-in-da-murder-cases/\">the disgraced former justice of the peace had nothing to do with the killings and was co-operating with police</a>.</p><p>But at a brief media conference on Wednesday afternoon, police released an affidavit alleging that Kim Williams had confessed to the murders and had implicated her husband. She was arrested and charged with capital murder, which potentially carries the death penalty. The 46-year-old is being held on a $10m bond.</p><p>\"Out of respect for the families of the victims, during this time, we are not answering any questions at this briefing until we're able to brief the family on the events of the past several days,\" Justin Lewis, a Kaufman County sheriff's department spokesman, told reporters.</p><p>In the absence of a firm suspect in the days following the deaths of the McLellands, who were both in their 60s, speculation had swirled that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/01/white-supremacist-group-linked-texas-da\">a prison gang such as the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas or a Mexican drug cartel might be responsible</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/04/colorado-texas-gang-white-supremacists\">The Texas governor, Rick Perry, arrived on the scene to announce a $200,000 reward for key information</a> and used an interview with Fox News to raise the issue of border security.</p><p><br />With no one claiming responsibility and officials apparently struggling for leads, tension was thick in Kaufman County, a large rural area about a half-hour drive south-east of Dallas. The McLellands' memorial (above) and funeral services took place amid an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, with a vast police presence including snipers on the roof of the church that held the memorial.</p><p>Now, if the authorities are proved right, the killings may have been prompted by something as simple as a feud between small-town political rivals that spiraled far out of control.</p><p>Beneath the dramatic and alarming talk of powerful and brutal international gangs bringing lethal force to a quiet community, there had been isolated hints of resentment towards McLelland's bombastic brand of law enforcement. On 5 April, the day that the McLellands were buried, a Kaufman County man was arrested and charged with making a threat on Facebook. The post allegedly said that another district attorney \"will soon perish\" and that staff in McLelland's office were not interested in \"actual guilt or innocence\" and were \"reaping what they have sown\". It followed the unconnected arrest earlier that week of another local man, who allegedly made threats against a Kaufman County official via a Crimestoppers hotline. <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/05/4752787/second-man-accused-of-making-threats.html\">Neither was a murder suspect</a>.</p><p>McLelland and Hasse prosecuted Eric Williams on charges of stealing three computer monitors from an office building in 2011. In December that year, Williams' lawyer tried unsuccessfully to remove McLelland and his staff from the case, claiming that the district attorney felt personal animosity towards Williams, stemming from an advertisement critical of McLelland that had run in local newspapers in 2006. That year, McLelland unsuccessfully ran for election as district attorney. He won the vote in 2010 and set about building a reputation as <a href=\"http://www.kaufmanherald.com/news/article_2775d76b-e0b2-5041-bb3c-84cd1365654f.html\">a hardliner who would destroy \"the good ol' boy network\"</a>.</p><p>During the trial, the prosecutors depicted Williams, above, as a violent, untrustworthy man. He was found guilty by a jury in March 2012, received two years' probation and lost his law license and his job as an elected justice of the peace. He was in the process of appealing the verdict when the McLellands died. Last week, Kim Williams told the Dallas Morning News that the couple have chronic health problems, no longer have health insurance and have been under financial stress.</p><p>Hasse, an assistant district attorney, was shot dead one block from the Kaufman County courthouse, on his way to work on 31 January. Standing outside the courthouse in his favorite wide-brimmed black cowboy hat, McLelland told reporters in a press conference that he would find the \"scum\" responsible.</p><p>The murders prompted speculation that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas may have carried out the crimes in retaliation for the prosecutors' involvement in a racketeering case brought in Houston last year against more than 30 gang members. In response to the killings in Forney, 21 miles from downtown Dallas, police stepped up protection for prosecutors across the state and one attorney withdrew from the racketeering case, apparently over security concerns.</p><p>Eric Williams has not been publicly named as a suspect by officials or been charged in connection with the deaths. But the 46-year-old allegedly emailed an anonymous threat to officers a day after the McLellands were found dead. According to the sheriff's office, the email suggested that if certain demands were not met, there would be another attack.</p><p>Towards the end of last week, the investigation seemed to be focusing more narrowly on Eric and Kim Williams. One official told the Associated Press that Eric Williams had a storage locker containing at least 20 weapons and that a Ford Crown Victoria car similar to one spotted in the McLellands' neighborhood on the day they died was also found at the facility in Seagoville, 15 miles west of Williams' home.</p><p>Today's affidavit states: \"Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office … both Mr Hasse and Mr McLelland regularly carried handguns after the Eric Williams jury trial because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-dart\">Tom Dart</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The LSE's public criticism sharpened after Tony Hall, the BBC director general, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/14/bbc-north-korea-panorama-film\" title=\"\">flatly rejected</a> the university's demands not to broadcast the film. Sweeney's Panorama aired as planned on BBC1 on Monday night.</p><p>The dispute is over whether the BBC had given the 10 students on the Pyongyang trip enough information about the risks of travelling with undercover journalists.</p><p>In the statement released on Wednesday night, six students backed the BBC and said they had no objection to the Panorama broadcast.</p><p>They said: \"When the story broke to the international media in response to a complaint about the trip, not all of us were consulted by the LSE, or their representatives, for our own accounts. Some of us have still not been consulted. We therefore feel compelled to establish the basic facts of the case, many of which have been distorted in the media, in this joint statement.\"</p><p>The students said they were told in London that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if they were rumbled. In Beijing, before they flew to Pyongyang, they were informed that Sweeney was the journalist and that he worked for the BBC, they said. They were also joined by Sweeney's wife, Tomiko Newson, who organised the trip, and a BBC cameraman.</p><p>Sweeney's Panorama film, North Korea Undercover, has been the subject of 348 complaints to the BBC since the public row broke out. Of these, about 150 were made before the documentary was broadcast.</p><p>The media regulator Ofcom has received fewer than 10 complaints.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics\">London School of Economics and Political Science</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education\">Higher education</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josh-halliday\">Josh Halliday</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That figure  is likely to reach at least 10 million, more than half the pre-war population of the country.</p><p>Another UN body, Unicef, says half of those currently in need are children.</p><p>\"I don't remember any other crisis where we are having 8,000 per day [fleeing across borders], every day since February,\" Guterres said in an interview with the Guardian. \"There will very likely be 3.5 million by the end of the year. We will have half the population of Syria in dire need of assistance and this is incomprehensible.</p><p>With the civil war now into its third year and increasingly taking the shape of a proxy regional war fought on a sectarian faultline, aid groups are making ever more strident predictions of a catastrophic funding shortfall.</p><p>Guterres goes further, warning that the modern boundaries of the Middle East and the post-Ottoman agreements that underpin them may unravel if the crisis is not brought to an end.</p><p>\"The political geography of the modern Middle East emerged from the Sykes Picot agreement with the exception of the never-resolved Israeli-Palestinian situation,\" he said of the Anglo-French deal at the end of the first world war that eventually formed the nation states of Syria and Lebanon. \"The conflict in Syria might for the first time put that political geography into question.\"</p><p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, this week both warned of a partition of the country that would inevitably cause grave ramifications in neighbouring Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and beyond.</p><p>Kerry appeared to advance the US position on Syria by suggesting an \"enclave break-up\" could only be prevented by getting \"everybody on the same page with respect to what post-Assad Syria will look like\".</p><p>Assad, meanwhile, reiterated his earlier warning that no country in the region would be safe if the Syrian war, in which a majority Sunni opposition is fighting a minority Alawite regime aligned to Shia Islam, led to the collapse of the embattled state's  borders.</p><p>UNHCR figures show that close to 1.3 million Syrians have fled the country in the past two years. The figure is markedly less than the numbers that left Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade, but is increasing at a faster rate  than at any point in either country.</p><p>In addition, there are thought to be at least 3 million internally displaced Syrian refugees, many of whom have limited means to provide for themselves or their families. Communities in Syria's war-ravaged north, west and south are  largely without electricity and low on food and running water.</p><p>Refugee camps in northern Jordan, southern Turkey and Lebanon's Bekaa valley are overwhelmed with daily arrivals of refugees who have often made precarious journeys to escape nearby battlefields.</p><p>\"This is the most brutal [conflict], even with very brutal conflicts elsewhere,\" said Guterres. \"If one looks at the impact on the population, or the percentage of the total population in need, I have no doubt that since the end of the cold war it is the worst. And it will become even worse still if there is no solution.</p><p>\"My belief is that if we take all of these elements, then this is the most dramatic humanitarian crisis that we have ever faced. Then if we look at the geopolitical implications, I have no doubt that this is the most serious that we have ever dealt with.\"</p><p>Lebanon and Iraq are increasingly unable to deal with the Syrian spillover, which is disturbing already fraught sectarian power bases and straining meagre resources during an economic downturn brought on by the crisis.</p><p>\"There is a real threat to Lebanon and Iraq,\" said Guterres. \"Jordan is under serious economic stress. We have the Palestinian/Israeli question and the fact that the Syrian army has withdrawn from the Golan Heights. In the context of the Sunni-Shia divide, all the key actors are involved.</p><p>\"Even compared to Afghanistan, the geopolitical implications and the threat to global stability are profound. It's the most dangerous of all crises.\"</p><p>In an address to the United Nations security council on Thursday, Guterres said there had \"not been an inch of progress towards a political solution\".</p><p>Expanding on that to the Guardian, he said: \"It is of enormous frustration that we have come to such a situation in global governance that nobody can address it.\"</p><p>Diplomacy on Syria has failed to bridge a yawning divide in views on what has fuelled the crisis and how best to deal with it. Russia and China, two permanent members of the security council, have blocked moves towards more robust support of the opposition in Syria. The US and Europe have attempted to impose ever-tougher sanctions on the Assad regime, but have baulked at arming the opposition because of concerns about the influence of al-Qaida groups.</p><p>\"I lived in a bi-polar world,\" said Guterres. \"Until the war in Iraq, I witnessed a unipolar world with one single superpower. Now we are in a clearly established multi-polar world. New actors have emerged – the Brics: China, Russia, Brazil, India. There is no longer a clear set of power relations. There is no way to bring about consensus among global players, or to bring about  common action. There is no capacity to produce any solution.\"</p><p>UN appeals for aid to Syria remain desperately under-funded with some agencies, including Unicef, reporting a shortfall of more than 70%. The crisis was eased somewhat on Thursday when Kuwait transferred $300m to the UN for Syria relief. \"[It] will be distributed across all of our institutions,\" said Guterres. The Kuwaitis are the only country of the Gulf that has honoured its promise through the multilateral aid organisations.</p><p>\"We can now put some money up front in Syria, but we are all in big trouble. Most of the western countries have huge budget difficulties. Moving towards 3 million refugees, there is no way that this can be dealt with.</p><p>\"The system is at breaking point. There is limited capacity to take many more. Where are the people going to flee?

Now we are in a clearly established multi-polar world. New actors have emerged – the Brics: China, Russia, Brazil, India. There is no longer a clear set of power relations. There is no way to bring about consensus among global players, or to bring about  common action. There is no capacity to produce any solution.\"</p><p>UN appeals for aid to Syria remain desperately under-funded with some agencies, including Unicef, reporting a shortfall of more than 70%. The crisis was eased somewhat on Thursday when Kuwait transferred $300m to the UN for Syria relief. \"[It] will be distributed across all of our institutions,\" said Guterres. The Kuwaitis are the only country of the Gulf that has honoured its promise through the multilateral aid organisations.</p><p>\"We can now put some money up front in Syria, but we are all in big trouble. Most of the western countries have huge budget difficulties. Moving towards 3 million refugees, there is no way that this can be dealt with.</p><p>\"The system is at breaking point. There is limited capacity to take many more. Where are the people going to flee? Into the sea?\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/refugees\">Refugees</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/aid\">Aid</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-chulov\">Martin Chulov</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Her victory in Boston should be remembered as another career highlight but instead the events that followed almost made the win feel like an irrelevance.</p><p>\"It was just a normal day,\" she says. \"When I crossed the finish line I couldn't believe that I was first in Boston and that I had won. I then went into a hotel at the finish line to do media and drug testing before heading back to my hotel. After showering I came out and my whole family and my team-mate Amanda were there, jaws dropped and watching TV. We were watching the replay over and over.</p><p>\"I was worried about other people, the marathon community is separate from track and you really get to know people. To see what happened – your eyes start to fill up with tears. But the medical staff reacted so quickly and people who were on the course ran to the hospital to donate blood.\"</p><p>Born with an underdeveloped spinal chord resulting in paralysis below the waist, McFadden is among 24 wheelchair athletes who have made the trip from Boston to compete in London.</p><p>Nicknamed \"the beast\" at university because of her weightlifting prowess, she walked on her hands for six years before being adopted by an American family in Baltimore. The 23-year-old will have a black ribbon pinned to her top on Sunday and admits her thoughts during the race will drift back to Boston.</p><p>\"I'm going to have it in the back of my mind,\" McFadden says. \"But I'm not nervous about competing, the security has been really good. There were people who picked us up right after we got off the plane.</p><p>\"People came together in Boston. It was about strangers helping strangers and people coming together as a community to help each other out. It didn't tear people apart – it brought people together and that was what mattered the most.</p><p>\"As an elite athlete with a disability, I'm a model for anybody – a person newly disabled or anybody. It's my job as an athlete to represent them and I hope to inspire people.\"</p><p>Boston also holds a special place in the heart of Geoffrey Mutai, the course record-holder for able-bodied men with a time of 2hr 3min 2sec set in 2011, the fastest marathon time despite it not being recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations owing to the layout of Boston's race.</p><p>Mutai will compete in the \"best elite men's field ever\" on Sunday, but the Kenyan will also be thinking about Monday's attacks. \"It was painful to see,\" he said. \"It's a special place and I know the city well. In sport for something to happen like that … you just think 'what did this person want?' People were running, people were tired, you should be there cheering with family and friends. I say to Boston we are very sorry, we are feeling so sad but we are together.</p><p>\"When you are running you are only focusing on your event, as an athlete you can't have any security concerns about terrorists. You must have a free mind and focus on your race. For things to happen in a competition like that is so sad, we must pray to god. We have been told the security will be tight.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-marathon\">London Marathon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/athletics\">Athletics</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Her victory in Boston should be remembered as another career highlight but instead the events that followed almost made the win feel like an irrelevance.</p><p>\"It was just a normal day,\" she says. \"When I crossed the finish line I couldn't believe that I was first in Boston and that I had won. I then went into a hotel at the finish line to do media and drug testing before heading back to my hotel. After showering I came out and my whole family and my team-mate Amanda were there, jaws dropped and watching TV. We were watching the replay over and over.</p><p>\"I was worried about other people, the marathon community is separate from track and you really get to know people. To see what happened – your eyes start to fill up with tears. But the medical staff reacted so quickly and people who were on the course ran to the hospital to donate blood.\"</p><p>Born with an underdeveloped spinal chord resulting in paralysis below the waist, McFadden is among 24 wheelchair athletes who have made the trip from Boston to compete in London.</p><p>Nicknamed \"the beast\" at university because of her weightlifting prowess, she walked on her hands for six years before being adopted by an American family in Baltimore. The 23-year-old will have a black ribbon pinned to her top on Sunday and admits her thoughts during the race will drift back to Boston.</p><p>\"I'm going to have it in the back of my mind,\" McFadden says. \"But I'm not nervous about competing, the security has been really good. There were people who picked us up right after we got off the plane.</p><p>\"People came together in Boston. It was about strangers helping strangers and people coming together as a community to help each other out. It didn't tear people apart – it brought people together and that was what mattered the most.</p><p>\"As an elite athlete with a disability, I'm a model for anybody – a person newly disabled or anybody. It's my job as an athlete to represent them and I hope to inspire people.\"</p><p>Boston also holds a special place in the heart of Geoffrey Mutai, the course record-holder for able-bodied men with a time of 2hr 3min 2sec set in 2011, the fastest marathon time despite it not being recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations owing to the layout of Boston's race.</p><p>Mutai will compete in the \"best elite men's field ever\" on Sunday, but the Kenyan will also be thinking about Monday's attacks. \"It was painful to see,\" he said. \"It's a special place and I know the city well. In sport for something to happen like that … you just think 'what did this person want?' People were running, people were tired, you should be there cheering with family and friends. I say to Boston we are very sorry, we are feeling so sad but we are together.</p><p>\"When you are running you are only focusing on your event, as an athlete you can't have any security concerns about terrorists. You must have a free mind and focus on your race. For things to happen in a competition like that is so sad, we must pray to god. We have been told the security will be tight.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-marathon\">London Marathon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/athletics\">Athletics</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This week it announced it would start taking video applications from members of the public who want to go on a one-way trip to Mars in 2023 for a reality TV show. Among the hopefuls might be British people forced out of their council flats by the \"bedroom tax\".</p><p></p><p>On Mars, the four initial residents –&nbsp;having been voted winners by the viewers from a pool of 40 – will get a roomy 50 sq m apartment each. Going off-planet is certainly one radical solution to the housing crisis. Strap a few hundred Barratt Homes developers onto a giant rocket as well and the red planet is your oyster.</p><p></p><p>It's an expensive project –&nbsp;the organisers hope to raise the £4bn cost by selling media rights – and a technically ambitious one, too. Mars One plans first to send a rover to choose a location, and then blast over food, generators, life-support and other gear – using vehicles from the private company SpaceX – before the humans arrive. But Nasa, who are the experts to date at sending stuff far away from Earth, have lost a number of craft they've sent to Mars. And what they've been able to land on the planet are a few adorable trundling robots rather than a self-supporting village for wannabe space celebrities.</p><p></p><p>Let's assume, though, that the contestants get there (after eight years of rigorous training), and can breathe and eat. They'll suffer constant video surveillance in a hostile environment, but then so do millions of Londoners. But what if they fall ill? Even if the producers make sure one of the contestants is a doctor, a single doctor can't be a specialist in everything. So it would probably be better if they were all doctors. Then the show could be sold as a kind of real-life Grey's Anatomy in space, with the inevitable low-gravity loving.</p><p>Cultural puritans might denounce the whole idea as a perverse extreme of reality TV, which in its Big Brother incarnation – a format also invented by the Dutch – was always designed primarily as a form of psychological torture for our sadistic viewing pleasure. In Mars One, the contestants are expected to die on set, which is a fate arguably even worse than having Simon Cowell touch you (more contestants will be sent out every two years, with the aim of establishing a self-sustaining community, but there will be no trips home).</p><p></p><p>Yet there still seems something heroic about this silly project. The Earth will be burned to a crisp and swallowed up by a bloated red-giant Sun in about 7bn years. If we haven't got used to colonising other planets and eventually other star systems by then, that will be the end of the human race.</p><p></p><p>If governments are no longer willing to fund such inspirational <em>grands projets</em>, we should be happy that other entities think they can raise the money instead, even if those entities are TV producers (the idea of privatised game-show space tourism would surely have tickled Lady Thatcher). And for those who think interplanetary exploration is just nonsense for space nerds, the same lessons could surely be applied closer to home.</p><p></p><p>Let's have a reality-TV contest in which top materials-science researchers vie to invent a more efficient kind of solar cell in order to combat global warming, while also having to rehearse and perform an entire postmodern circus in skimpy costumes.

This week it announced it would start taking video applications from members of the public who want to go on a one-way trip to Mars in 2023 for a reality TV show. Among the hopefuls might be British people forced out of their council flats by the \"bedroom tax\".</p><p></p><p>On Mars, the four initial residents –&nbsp;having been voted winners by the viewers from a pool of 40 – will get a roomy 50 sq m apartment each. Going off-planet is certainly one radical solution to the housing crisis. Strap a few hundred Barratt Homes developers onto a giant rocket as well and the red planet is your oyster.</p><p></p><p>It's an expensive project –&nbsp;the organisers hope to raise the £4bn cost by selling media rights – and a technically ambitious one, too. Mars One plans first to send a rover to choose a location, and then blast over food, generators, life-support and other gear – using vehicles from the private company SpaceX – before the humans arrive. But Nasa, who are the experts to date at sending stuff far away from Earth, have lost a number of craft they've sent to Mars. And what they've been able to land on the planet are a few adorable trundling robots rather than a self-supporting village for wannabe space celebrities.</p><p></p><p>Let's assume, though, that the contestants get there (after eight years of rigorous training), and can breathe and eat. They'll suffer constant video surveillance in a hostile environment, but then so do millions of Londoners. But what if they fall ill? Even if the producers make sure one of the contestants is a doctor, a single doctor can't be a specialist in everything. So it would probably be better if they were all doctors. Then the show could be sold as a kind of real-life Grey's Anatomy in space, with the inevitable low-gravity loving.</p><p>Cultural puritans might denounce the whole idea as a perverse extreme of reality TV, which in its Big Brother incarnation – a format also invented by the Dutch – was always designed primarily as a form of psychological torture for our sadistic viewing pleasure. In Mars One, the contestants are expected to die on set, which is a fate arguably even worse than having Simon Cowell touch you (more contestants will be sent out every two years, with the aim of establishing a self-sustaining community, but there will be no trips home).</p><p></p><p>Yet there still seems something heroic about this silly project. The Earth will be burned to a crisp and swallowed up by a bloated red-giant Sun in about 7bn years. If we haven't got used to colonising other planets and eventually other star systems by then, that will be the end of the human race.</p><p></p><p>If governments are no longer willing to fund such inspirational <em>grands projets</em>, we should be happy that other entities think they can raise the money instead, even if those entities are TV producers (the idea of privatised game-show space tourism would surely have tickled Lady Thatcher). And for those who think interplanetary exploration is just nonsense for space nerds, the same lessons could surely be applied closer to home.</p><p></p><p>Let's have a reality-TV contest in which top materials-science researchers vie to invent a more efficient kind of solar cell in order to combat global warming, while also having to rehearse and perform an entire postmodern circus in skimpy costumes. Or, since 61% of the UK public now believe that utilities are better run in public hands, we could make a reality-TV show out of economists and other wonks trying desperately to renationalise the electricity supply.

If the vote is approved, \"no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,\" Deron Smith, the organization's spokesman, told Reuters.</p><p>The compromise comes as gay-rights groups have demanded a complete lifting of the ban amid political support from both president Barack Obama and former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Corporate sponsors, including drugs giant Merck, have suspended funding for the BSA, citing its discrimination against gay people.</p><p>At the same time some religious and conservative groups have pressed for the ban to remain. The organisation estimates that easing the ban on gay adults could cost the organization 100,000 to 350,000 members.

If the vote is approved, \"no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,\" Deron Smith, the organization's spokesman, told Reuters.</p><p>The compromise comes as gay-rights groups have demanded a complete lifting of the ban amid political support from both president Barack Obama and former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Corporate sponsors, including drugs giant Merck, have suspended funding for the BSA, citing its discrimination against gay people.</p><p>At the same time some religious and conservative groups have pressed for the ban to remain.

Halappanavar died after being denied an emergency termination in October and her case has since been at the centre of Ireland's abortion wars. The inquest jury strongly endorsed the nine recommendations of the coroner, Ciaran MacLoughlin, including a suggestion that the Irish Medical Council lay out exactly when a doctor can intervene to save the life of a mother in similar circumstances.</p><p>The significance of this will only be known when the medical council delivers its guidelines. Abortion in Ireland is permitted where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother. If the medical council agrees that termination is permitted whenever a foetal membrane ruptures, then there is an implication that a small risk to the life of the mother trumps the right to life of the foetus. Not all women with ruptured membranes develop sepsis, and, to the best of my understanding, most sepsis is treatable through antibiotics. It would, therefore, be difficult to categorise ruptured membranes as a substantial risk to life.</p><p>If the medical council agrees that termination is permitted where the foetus is unviable, then this may open the door to termination for fatal foetal abnormality, currently illegal in the Republic. But all this is simply speculation – the medical council is a conservative beast: it could equally provide guidelines that support the actions of Halappanavar's medical team, who moved to terminate only when her sepsis was genuinely life-threatening.</p><p>Halappanavar's death made people who usually ignore the fact that Ireland is a little dot of backwardness in a sea of progressive reproductive values sit up and take note. She did not die for want of a termination in a developing country, but in 21st-century western Europe. Increasingly cosmopolitan, and, in spite of the crash, no longer the EU's poor and pitiable ward, it's easy to forget that Ireland is a very conservative country compared with its European counterparts. As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/15/abortion-ireland-opus-dei-catholic\" title=\"\">have argued before</a>, the separation of church and state in Ireland is an incomplete project at best.</p><p>At the inquest, Halappanavar's consultant, Dr Katherine Astbury, said that she met her patient's request for an abortion with the explanation that a poor foetal prognosis does not provide legal grounds for termination in the Republic. It must seem incomprehensible to people outside Ireland that when Halappanavar asked for a termination knowing that her pregnancy could not survive she was denied one because of the presence of a foetal heartbeat. In Ireland, however, women told that they are carrying live foetuses with fatal abnormalities routinely go to the UK to abort rather than wait weeks for their pregnancy to die, all the while growing bigger and trying to answer cheerful questions about the new baby without breaking into tears.</p><p>What's important to note here is that Halappanavar – a foreign national and a medical professional – felt it within her right to ask for a termination. Would an Irishwoman, brought up in a culture in which abortion is a dirty word and a shameful deed – and especially a less educated or differently educated Irishwoman – even have asked? Sometimes it takes an outside element to show how utterly messed up the system is.</p><p>One of the reasons that Halappanavar's death became an international news story was her husband Praveen's insistence that hospital staff told his wife that she couldn't have a termination because Ireland is a Catholic country. During the inquest, the midwife Ann Maria Burke came forward to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ann-maria-burke-says-remark-was-intended-to-be-broad-and-explanatory-1.1356387\" title=\"\">apologetically explain that she was the source of this remark</a>. She said that she had only wanted to throw light on Irish culture for Halappanavar, explaining: \"It was the law of the land and there were two referendums where the Catholic church was pressing the buttons.\" From reportage, it looks as though she was all but slapped on the wrist by the coroner, who told her that Irish public hospitals do not follow any religious tenet or dogma.</p><p>Burke deserves praise, not sanction, for telling Halappanavar the truth as to why she couldn't have a termination. Where Astbury defends her medical practice through reference to law, and MacLoughlin places Irish hospitals above religious dogma, Burke alone acknowledges the logic behind the legality. The only possible logic for denying Halappanavar the treatment she would have received in other developed countries is Catholic logic.</p><p>The evidence given at the inquest shows unequivocally that Halappanavar would have received different treatment in a different jurisdiction. Astbury admitted as much, and expert witness Dr Peter Boylan has said Halappanavar would most likely be alive if she'd been given a termination, as she requested, within two days of admission to hospital.</p><p>The inquest into Halappanavar's death has delivered its verdict on what would have been her fifth wedding anniversary. I inject this element of humanity into my article not to tug on heartstrings for a pro-choice cause, but to remind us that, for all that Halappanavar's death has come to symbolise in Ireland, hers is a human story and a human tragedy. Praveen Halappanavar <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/husband-objects-to-inquiry-members-1.554117\" title=\"\">has said</a>: \"The law has to change.

It was here, at about 10.20pm on Thursday night, that an extroardinary sequence of events began to unfold.</p><p>The first incident reported to police was an armed robbery at a 7-Eleven store in the square. A man in a grey hooded top was captured on digital footage taken by a security camera in the store.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a young MIT police officer called Sean Collier responded to reports of a disturbance on the campus itself. He drove his patrol car to Kendall Square, at the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets.</p><p>The location is among the most prized pieces of academic real estate in the world. Right next to it is the Stata Center, a building constructed in the architect Frank Gehry's trademark sweeps of twisted metal that houses the offices of philosopher Noam Chomsky and the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee.</p><p>Collier, 26, who had worked as a police officer for just a year, did not have the chance to check out the reported disturbance, or do anything else. He was set upon by two people in what police described as an ambush, and shot multiple times as he sat in his police cruiser. He was rushed to Massachusetts General hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p><p>\"MIT is heartbroken by the news that an MIT police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty on campus,\" the institute said later.</p><p>The horrifying events at MIT were just the start of a frenzied night of violence and fear. Shortly after Collier was shot, 911 calls came in reporting an armed carjacking of a black Mercedes SUV took place in Third Street, on the edge of the MIT campus.</p><p>The owner of the car was ordered by the two armed carjackers to go down Memorial Drive, which runs along the banks of the Charles river basin. There are unconfirmed reports that during the time the car owner was kept kidnapped within his own vehicle, his captors admitted to him that they were the Boston marathon bombers.</p><p>Only six hours previously, the FBI had released to the public photographs of two men they said were suspects in the bombing. Suspect One was a heavy-set man wearing a black baseball hat and black jacket; Suspect Two was younger and slighter, wearing a grey hoodie and a white baseball cap turned backwards.</p><h2>'Extremely dangerous'</h2><p>The Boston FBI chief, Rick DesLauriers, who has led the massive hunt for the bombers involving more than 1,000 federal agents, warned the public at that press conference that the two suspects were armed and \"considered extremely dangerous\". He said that no-one should approach them under any circumstances.</p><p>According to Boston police, the Mercedes owner was set free by his kidnappers at a petrol station along Memorial Drive about half an hour after they forcefully took over his car. The two men then sped off along Memorial Drive in the direction of Watertown, a suburb in the north-western side of Boston.</p><p>As they tore off into the night, the speeding Mercedes was chased by a lengthening convoy of law enforcers. Local and state police, as well as federal agents, joined in the chase that ended in Watertown, a town of about 30,000.</p><p>Before the Mercedes screeched to a halt, the two fugitives threw explosive devices out of the windows of the vehicle, including metal items that local residents described as looking like pressure cookers - the crude but terrifyingly powerful homemade devices that had been used to kill three people and injure more than 170 at the marathon bombing. One of the devices exploded as it was propelled from the car, causing a large fireball.</p><p>Loretta Kehayias, 65, a local resident, said the explosions \"lit up the whole house. I screamed. I've never seen anything like this. Never, never, never.\"</p><p>Police officers shouted at people in the street that suspects were \"throwing explosives\" and warned of \"unexploded ordnance\" on the street.</p><p>As the Mercedes came to a stop, a huge gunfight erupted with the pursuing police officers. A local resident near Dexter Avenue and Laurel Street in Watertown recorded on her cell phone the exchange of fire. The intense blast of shooting lasted for several minutes and sounded like a war zone.</p><p>In the course of the gunfight, one of the scores of officers involved, Richard Donahue of the Boston Transit police, was shot. Donahue, 33 and with a six-month-old baby, was taken to Mt Auburn hospital were he remains in critical condition.</p><p>Twenty other police officers from Watertown and other units were also given hospital treatment as a result of the explosive devices launched from the fugitives' Mercedes.</p><p>There was one other important casualty in the gunfight. A man with dark hair was seen lying in the middle of Laurel Street, his armed splayed out, with about 15 armed police surrounding him.</p><p>He was later identified as Suspect One, the man with the black baseball hat caught on security cameras walking along Boylston Street towards the finishing line of the marathon, a large black backpack slung on his shoulders, shortly before Monday's blasts. After police had secured the scene, Suspect One was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center at about 1.10am and taken immediately into the operating room.</p><p>He was pronounced dead at about 1.35am. Dr Richard Wolfe of Beth Israel reported that he had suffered not just gunshot wounds, but \"a combination of injuries. We believe a combination of blasts and multiple gunshot wounds.\"</p><p>The revelation that one of the suspects had died partially from blast injuries seemed to correlate with reports that police had found a suicide vest strapped to Suspect One's chest.</p><p>Suspect Two managed to elude the enormous army of law enforcers that had by now assembled in Watertown. He appears to have carjacked a dark green SUV and drove it at high speed a little way down the street, before leaping out of the car and escaping on foot.</p><p>The car was followed by a hail of police fire. The back window of the SUV was shattered, and up to 92 bullet casings were counted around the vehicle during a later police investigation of the crime scene.</p><h2>'Bullet hole through our wall and the chair'</h2><p>The prolonged firefight involving the two men was captured in real time on Twitter. Andrew Kitzenberg, who lives in Laurel Street, had been watching a sports game on TV when he heard commotion right outside his three-floor window.</p><p>\"I heard gunshots. I peeked through the window and saw two shooters between two cars,\" he tweeted at around 1am.</p><p>Kitzenberg witnessed the two suspects in \"constant gunfire\" with officers. One of his tweets, accompanied by a digital picture showing two women cowering at the bottom of a stairwell, said: \"Bullet hole through our wall and the chair.\"</p><p>Kitzenberg, who unexpectedly had just become a highly-followed citizen reporter, watched as a police car drove at high speed towards the shooters, but then spun out of control and crashed into cars parked along the sidewalk. \"Crashed cop car with all windows shot out in our driveway,\"  he tweeted under his handle @kitz.</p><p>A Laurel Street neighbour of Kitzenberg's, who was not named, also gave an account of the events to local reporters. At about 1am, he said, he was awoken by the sound of gunfire.</p><p>\"I saw two individuals in a car that had stopped suddenly. The windows had been blown out and they were firing in the direction of Dexter Street. Then a police cruiser lost control and crashed into my neighbour's car.\"</p><p>As a sign of the chaos that engulfed the chase, when the neighbour called 911 to report the shootout, the emergency dispatcher sound surprised and was evidently unaware of what was going on.</p><p>Later, the witness saw a police bomb-disposal robot brought in to investigate what looked to him like a pressure cooker lying on the road.</p><p>Once the firefight was over, the hunt focused on Suspect Two, the man now known as \"White Cap\", who was still at large. At about 3am the head of Boston police, Ed Davis, told reporters assembled at the edge of a 20-block exclusion zone that had been set up that Suspect Two was still considered extremely dangerous. \"We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people, and we need to get him in custody.\"</p><p>Police chiefs also confirmed at that point what everybody had already been surmising – that the two fugitives were the same suspects whose photographs had been released on Thursday evening in the hunt for the Boston marathon bombers. Later in the morning, they were identified as Chechen brothers – Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was by now dead, and the younger \"White Cap\" suspect Dzhokhar Tsamaev, 19, who was still on the run.</p><p>From about 1.30am the suburb of Watertown and the entire greater Boston area remained in a prolonged state of siege. At about 4am it was announced by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick that public transport in the whole region had been shut down – Boston, who President Obama on Thursday called one of the \"world's great cities\" had effectively been put into lockdown.</p><p>\"Do not open your doors,\" was the message from Commissioner Davis to the people of the city. \"Stay in your home. We believe this man to be a terrorist and we need to get him into custody.\"</p><p>Ten hours into the search for Dzhokhar Tsamaev, a 19-year-old now on his own and facing the combined forces of America's most highly trained and heavily armed law enforcement agencies, there was still no sign of him. Swat teams carrying long rifles and carrying protective shields were sent door to door in the hunt, clearing up to 60% of Watertown by midday, with backup from bomb squads and a long line of military armoured vehicles.</p><p>Officers swept on two locations in Watertown and swarmed them for periods of up to an hour, but in both occasions the search ended in frustration. The operation remains frenzied and nervous, made all the more twitchy by the awareness that White Cap might have strapped himself with a suicide vest as his brother appears to have done.</p><p>Hours after the start of the drama in Central Square, Suspect Two remained unapprehended and Boston ground to a standstill. A daze of sheer disbelief hung over Watertown, and the region, and the whole of America.</p><p>Boston's mayor, Thomas Menino, appeared at lunchtime in front of the world's television cameras. He said the words that he has repeated all week, since carnage ripped through his city on marathon day.</p><p>\"We will get through this, we are a strong city, we will not be intimidated by terrorists,\" he said. But there was a difference: this time the mayor's voice sounded shaky.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Right next to it is the Stata Center, a building constructed in the architect Frank Gehry's trademark sweeps of twisted metal that houses the offices of philosopher Noam Chomsky and the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee.</p><p>Collier, 26, who had worked as a police officer for just a year, did not have the chance to check out the reported disturbance, or do anything else. He was set upon by two people in what police described as an ambush, and shot multiple times as he sat in his police cruiser. He was rushed to Massachusetts General hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p><p>\"MIT is heartbroken by the news that an MIT police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty on campus,\" the institute said later.</p><p>The horrifying events at MIT were just the start of a frenzied night of violence and fear. Shortly after Collier was shot, 911 calls came in reporting an armed carjacking of a black Mercedes SUV took place in Third Street, on the edge of the MIT campus.</p><p>The owner of the car was ordered by the two armed carjackers to go down Memorial Drive, which runs along the banks of the Charles river basin. There are unconfirmed reports that during the time the car owner was kept kidnapped within his own vehicle, his captors admitted to him that they were the Boston marathon bombers.</p><p>Only six hours previously, the FBI had released to the public photographs of two men they said were suspects in the bombing. Suspect One was a heavy-set man wearing a black baseball hat and black jacket; Suspect Two was younger and slighter, wearing a grey hoodie and a white baseball cap turned backwards.</p><h2>'Extremely dangerous'</h2><p>The Boston FBI chief, Rick DesLauriers, who has led the massive hunt for the bombers involving more than 1,000 federal agents, warned the public at that press conference that the two suspects were armed and \"considered extremely dangerous\". He said that no-one should approach them under any circumstances.</p><p>According to Boston police, the Mercedes owner was set free by his kidnappers at a petrol station along Memorial Drive about half an hour after they forcefully took over his car. The two men then sped off along Memorial Drive in the direction of Watertown, a suburb in the north-western side of Boston.</p><p>As they tore off into the night, the speeding Mercedes was chased by a lengthening convoy of law enforcers. Local and state police, as well as federal agents, joined in the chase that ended in Watertown, a town of about 30,000.</p><p>Before the Mercedes screeched to a halt, the two fugitives threw explosive devices out of the windows of the vehicle, including metal items that local residents described as looking like pressure cookers - the crude but terrifyingly powerful homemade devices that had been used to kill three people and injure more than 170 at the marathon bombing. One of the devices exploded as it was propelled from the car, causing a large fireball.</p><p>Loretta Kehayias, 65, a local resident, said the explosions \"lit up the whole house. I screamed. I've never seen anything like this. Never, never, never.\"</p><p>Police officers shouted at people in the street that suspects were \"throwing explosives\" and warned of \"unexploded ordnance\" on the street.</p><p>As the Mercedes came to a stop, a huge gunfight erupted with the pursuing police officers. A local resident near Dexter Avenue and Laurel Street in Watertown recorded on her cell phone the exchange of fire. The intense blast of shooting lasted for several minutes and sounded like a war zone.</p><p>In the course of the gunfight, one of the scores of officers involved, Richard Donahue of the Boston Transit police, was shot. Donahue, 33 and with a six-month-old baby, was taken to Mt Auburn hospital were he remains in critical condition.</p><p>Twenty other police officers from Watertown and other units were also given hospital treatment as a result of the explosive devices launched from the fugitives' Mercedes.</p><p>There was one other important casualty in the gunfight. A man with dark hair was seen lying in the middle of Laurel Street, his armed splayed out, with about 15 armed police surrounding him.</p><p>He was later identified as Suspect One, the man with the black baseball hat caught on security cameras walking along Boylston Street towards the finishing line of the marathon, a large black backpack slung on his shoulders, shortly before Monday's blasts. After police had secured the scene, Suspect One was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center at about 1.10am and taken immediately into the operating room.</p><p>He was pronounced dead at about 1.35am. Dr Richard Wolfe of Beth Israel reported that he had suffered not just gunshot wounds, but \"a combination of injuries. We believe a combination of blasts and multiple gunshot wounds.\"</p><p>The revelation that one of the suspects had died partially from blast injuries seemed to correlate with reports that police had found a suicide vest strapped to Suspect One's chest.</p><p>Suspect Two managed to elude the enormous army of law enforcers that had by now assembled in Watertown. He appears to have carjacked a dark green SUV and drove it at high speed a little way down the street, before leaping out of the car and escaping on foot.</p><p>The car was followed by a hail of police fire. The back window of the SUV was shattered, and up to 92 bullet casings were counted around the vehicle during a later police investigation of the crime scene.</p><h2>'Bullet hole through our wall and the chair'</h2><p>The prolonged firefight involving the two men was captured in real time on Twitter. Andrew Kitzenberg, who lives in Laurel Street, had been watching a sports game on TV when he heard commotion right outside his three-floor window.</p><p>\"I heard gunshots. I peeked through the window and saw two shooters between two cars,\" he tweeted at around 1am.</p><p>Kitzenberg witnessed the two suspects in \"constant gunfire\" with officers. One of his tweets, accompanied by a digital picture showing two women cowering at the bottom of a stairwell, said: \"Bullet hole through our wall and the chair.\"</p><p>Kitzenberg, who unexpectedly had just become a highly-followed citizen reporter, watched as a police car drove at high speed towards the shooters, but then spun out of control and crashed into cars parked along the sidewalk. \"Crashed cop car with all windows shot out in our driveway,\"  he tweeted under his handle @kitz.</p><p>A Laurel Street neighbour of Kitzenberg's, who was not named, also gave an account of the events to local reporters. At about 1am, he said, he was awoken by the sound of gunfire.</p><p>\"I saw two individuals in a car that had stopped suddenly. The windows had been blown out and they were firing in the direction of Dexter Street. Then a police cruiser lost control and crashed into my neighbour's car.\"</p><p>As a sign of the chaos that engulfed the chase, when the neighbour called 911 to report the shootout, the emergency dispatcher sound surprised and was evidently unaware of what was going on.</p><p>Later, the witness saw a police bomb-disposal robot brought in to investigate what looked to him like a pressure cooker lying on the road.</p><p>Once the firefight was over, the hunt focused on Suspect Two, the man now known as \"White Cap\", who was still at large. At about 3am the head of Boston police, Ed Davis, told reporters assembled at the edge of a 20-block exclusion zone that had been set up that Suspect Two was still considered extremely dangerous. \"We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people, and we need to get him in custody.\"</p><p>Police chiefs also confirmed at that point what everybody had already been surmising – that the two fugitives were the same suspects whose photographs had been released on Thursday evening in the hunt for the Boston marathon bombers. Later in the morning, they were identified as Chechen brothers – Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was by now dead, and the younger \"White Cap\" suspect Dzhokhar Tsamaev, 19, who was still on the run.</p><p>From about 1.30am the suburb of Watertown and the entire greater Boston area remained in a prolonged state of siege. At about 4am it was announced by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick that public transport in the whole region had been shut down – Boston, who President Obama on Thursday called one of the \"world's great cities\" had effectively been put into lockdown.</p><p>\"Do not open your doors,\" was the message from Commissioner Davis to the people of the city. \"Stay in your home. We believe this man to be a terrorist and we need to get him into custody.\"</p><p>Ten hours into the search for Dzhokhar Tsamaev, a 19-year-old now on his own and facing the combined forces of America's most highly trained and heavily armed law enforcement agencies, there was still no sign of him. Swat teams carrying long rifles and carrying protective shields were sent door to door in the hunt, clearing up to 60% of Watertown by midday, with backup from bomb squads and a long line of military armoured vehicles.</p><p>Officers swept on two locations in Watertown and swarmed them for periods of up to an hour, but in both occasions the search ended in frustration. The operation remains frenzied and nervous, made all the more twitchy by the awareness that White Cap might have strapped himself with a suicide vest as his brother appears to have done.</p><p>Hours after the start of the drama in Central Square, Suspect Two remained unapprehended and Boston ground to a standstill. A daze of sheer disbelief hung over Watertown, and the region, and the whole of America.</p><p>Boston's mayor, Thomas Menino, appeared at lunchtime in front of the world's television cameras. He said the words that he has repeated all week, since carnage ripped through his city on marathon day.</p><p>\"We will get through this, we are a strong city, we will not be intimidated by terrorists,\" he said. But there was a difference: this time the mayor's voice sounded shaky.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

On the plane, a Soviet Ilyushin Il-62 from the 1960s, I'd&nbsp;been handed a copy of the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's daily newspaper. The front page informed me that hunger and flooding were widespread in South Korea. Help was on its way, however, as&nbsp;Kim Jong-il was reportedly sending sandbags and food supplies to poverty-stricken Seoul. The poles of reality, I&nbsp;understood from that article, had now&nbsp;been reversed, and even though I'd&nbsp;spent three years writing and researching a novel set in North Korea, I&nbsp;realised I was unprepared for what I&nbsp;was about to encounter in \"the most glorious nation in the world\".</p><p>As we drove south toward the capital, the roads were largely abandoned. I had yet to learn to recognise the sight of a&nbsp;tank trap or the guard towers placed at the corners of cornfields. I was unaware of&nbsp;North Korea's \"Let's turn grass into meat\" campaign, so I assumed the roadside portraits of dancing rabbits and&nbsp;goats were intended to delight local&nbsp;children. As we drove, one of our&nbsp;guides, a clean-cut young man, informed me that I was now in the most democratic nation in the world, where crime was unheard of and healthcare was universal. He stared earnestly into my eyes as he explained that no one in his country wanted for anything.</p><p>Suddenly, a vehicle on the road caught my eye. It was a dump truck headed north toward the countryside, and its bed was filled with residents of Pyongyang. The truck was decades old, and lacked a tailgate, so the people in the back were crammed together to avoid falling out. One bump would send half of them tumbling on to&nbsp;the road. As&nbsp;the truck flashed past, I&nbsp;saw clearly a&nbsp;man in a&nbsp;suit holding a briefcase. Beside him was a woman in a white labcoat. Despite&nbsp;the wind, her eyes were&nbsp;open as&nbsp;she stared without expression at the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>\"Where are those people going?\" I&nbsp;asked our other guide.</p><p>\"They're volunteers,\" she answered. \"They're going to help with the harvest.\"</p><p>\"They volunteered?\" I asked.</p><p>She seemed not to understand the question. \"Everyone must volunteer,\" she told me.</p><p>One of the limitations of being human&nbsp;is that we're each stuck in our own experience, forever forbidden from knowing the true thoughts of another. It's for this reason that the power of storytelling holds such sway over us, especially in the form of the novel, which, of all art forms, is perhaps most capable of communicating the private lives of others. On that North Korean highway, I wondered who the woman in&nbsp;the labcoat was, what she had been thinking as the wind whipped her hair, where she'd been headed that morning when Pyongyang's Minister of Mass Mobilisation conscripted her to work in&nbsp;the rice fields. And I understood the only way I'd ever find out is if I made her&nbsp;a character in my novel.</p><p>I'd started writing about North Korea&nbsp;because of a fascination with propaganda and the way it prescribes an official narrative to an entire people. In Pyongyang, that narrative begins with the founding of a glorious nation under the fatherly guidance of Kim Il-sung, and is&nbsp;followed by years of industry and&nbsp;sacrifice among its citizenry, so that when Kim Jong-il comes to power, all is&nbsp;strength, happiness and prosperity. It&nbsp;didn't matter that the story was a complete fiction – every citizen was forced to become a character whose motivations, desires and fears were dictated by this script.

Travelling to North Korea filled me with a sense that every person there, from the lowliest labourer to military leaders, had to surrender a rich&nbsp;private life in order to enact one prewritten by the party. To capture this&nbsp;on the page, I created characters across all levels of society, from the orphan, the soldier, the sailor, the bureaucrat, the general and the actor, to&nbsp;the woman in the labcoat. What should have been obvious at the outset (but didn't become apparent until I&nbsp;was&nbsp;deep into the book) was this: all narrative paths led back to Kim Jong-il.

The nation is a mystery-generating engine, and the more I study the place, the more questions I have. How can we truly know anything about North Korea? Who am I to speak for a people whose experiences are so different than my own? Is the portrait I've created accurate? I don't think we can know until North Koreans are free to tell their own stories.

This area of darkness is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p><p>North Korea faded to black in the early 1990s. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had propped up its old communist ally with cheap fuel oil, North Korea's creakily inefficient economy collapsed. Power stations rusted into ruin. The lights went out. When the sun drops low in the sky, the landscape fades to grey and the squat little houses are swallowed by the night. Entire villages vanish in the dusk.</p><p>North Koreans complain bitterly about the darkness. They can't read at&nbsp;night. They can't watch television. But the dark has advantages of its own. Especially if you are a teenager dating somebody you can't be seen with.</p><p>When adults go to bed, sometimes as early as 7pm in winter, it is easy enough to slip out of the house. The darkness confers measures of privacy and freedom as hard to come by in North&nbsp;Korea as electricity.</p><p>I met many North Koreans who told me how much they learned to love&nbsp;the darkness, but it was the story of one girl and her boyfriend that impressed me most. She was 12 years&nbsp;old when she met a guy three years older from a neighbouring town. Her family was low-ranking in the country's Byzantine system of social controls. To be seen in public together would damage the boy's&nbsp;career prospects as well as her reputation as a virtuous young woman. So their dates consisted entirely of long walks in the dark.</p><p>The girl would emerge just as soon as&nbsp;she could extricate herself from the family. Stepping outside, she would peer into the darkness, unable to see him at first, but sensing with certainty his presence. She wouldn't bother with makeup – no one needs it in the dark.</p><p>The young couple would walk through the night, scattering ginkgo leaves in their wake. What did they talk about? Their families, classmates, books – whatever the topic, it was endlessly fascinating. Years later, when I&nbsp;asked the&nbsp;girl about the happiest memories of her life, she told me of&nbsp;those nights.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that shows up in satellite photographs. Whether in CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or in the East Asian Studies department of a university, people usually analyse North Korea from afar. They don't stop to think that in the middle of this black hole, in this bleak, dark country where millions have died of starvation, there is also love.</p><p><em>This is an edited extract from Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy: Real Lives&nbsp;in North Korea, published by Granta&nbsp;at £14.99.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had propped up its old communist ally with cheap fuel oil, North Korea's creakily inefficient economy collapsed. Power stations rusted into ruin. The lights went out. When the sun drops low in the sky, the landscape fades to grey and the squat little houses are swallowed by the night. Entire villages vanish in the dusk.</p><p>North Koreans complain bitterly about the darkness. They can't read at&nbsp;night. They can't watch television. But the dark has advantages of its own. Especially if you are a teenager dating somebody you can't be seen with.</p><p>When adults go to bed, sometimes as early as 7pm in winter, it is easy enough to slip out of the house. The darkness confers measures of privacy and freedom as hard to come by in North&nbsp;Korea as electricity.</p><p>I met many North Koreans who told me how much they learned to love&nbsp;the darkness, but it was the story of one girl and her boyfriend that impressed me most. She was 12 years&nbsp;old when she met a guy three years older from a neighbouring town. Her family was low-ranking in the country's Byzantine system of social controls. To be seen in public together would damage the boy's&nbsp;career prospects as well as her reputation as a virtuous young woman. So their dates consisted entirely of long walks in the dark.</p><p>The girl would emerge just as soon as&nbsp;she could extricate herself from the family. Stepping outside, she would peer into the darkness, unable to see him at first, but sensing with certainty his presence. She wouldn't bother with makeup – no one needs it in the dark.</p><p>The young couple would walk through the night, scattering ginkgo leaves in their wake. What did they talk about? Their families, classmates, books – whatever the topic, it was endlessly fascinating. Years later, when I&nbsp;asked the&nbsp;girl about the happiest memories of her life, she told me of&nbsp;those nights.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that shows up in satellite photographs. Whether in CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or in the East Asian Studies department of a university, people usually analyse North Korea from afar. They don't stop to think that in the middle of this black hole, in this bleak, dark country where millions have died of starvation, there is also love.</p><p><em>This is an edited extract from Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy: Real Lives&nbsp;in North Korea, published by Granta&nbsp;at £14.99.
