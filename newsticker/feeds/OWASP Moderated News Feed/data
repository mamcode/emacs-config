Stuff like posting creds over HTTPS isn’t enough, you have to load login forms over HTTPS as well and then you can’t send auth cookies over HTTP because they’ll get sniffed and sessions hijacked and so on and so forth. This is all pretty much security people rhetoric designed to instil fear but without a whole lot of practical basis, right?</p>  <p>That’s an easy assumption to make because it’s hard to observe the risk of insufficient transport layer protection being exploited, at least compared to something like XSS or SQL injection. But it turns out that exploiting unprotected network traffic can actually be extremely simple, you just need to have the right gear. Say hello to my little friend:</p>  <p> </p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wi-Fi Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KA7rofLkRpE/UW538jHFdmI/AAAAAAAAFHE/JPtjHlcp8nw/Untitled-12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"317\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, is a Pineapple. But it’s not just any pineapple, it’s a <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple\">Wi-Fi Pineapple</a> and it has some very impressive party tricks that will help the naysayers understand the real risk of insufficient transport layer protection in web applications which, hopefully, will ultimately help them build safer sites. Let me demonstrate.</p> <a name=\"more\"></a>  <h4>What is this “Pineapple” you speak of?!</h4>  <p>What you’re looking at in the image above is a little device about the size of a cigarette packet running a piece of firmware known as “Jasager” (which over in Germany means “The Yes Man”) based on <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWrt</a> (think of it as Linux for embedded devices). Selling for only $100, it packs Wi-Fi capabilities, a USB jack, a couple of RJ45 Ethernet connectors and implements a kernal mode wireless feature known as “Karma”.</p>  <p>Huh? This is starting to slip into the realm of specialist security gear which is increasingly far away from the everyday issues we deal with as software developers. But it’s <em>exceptionally </em>important because it helps us understand in very graphic terms what the risk of insufficient transport layer protection really is.</p>  <p>The easiest way to think of the Pineapple is as a little device that sits between an unsuspecting user’s PC (or iPhone or other internet connected device) and the resource they’re attempting to access. What this means is that an attacker is able to launch a “Man in the Middle” or MiTM attack by inspecting the data that flow between the victim and any resources they’re accessing on the web. The physical design of the Pineapple means that victims can connect to it via its Wi-Fi adapter and it can connect to a PC with an internet connection via the physical Ethernet adapter. It all looks a bit like this:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Launching an MiTM attack with the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MAg76YqFJ0Q/UW539WEKwXI/AAAAAAAAFHM/E6yZNVJZA7A/WiFi-Pineapple5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"880\" height=\"244\" /></p>  <p>This isn’t the only way of configuring the thing, but being tethered to the attacker’s PC is the easiest way of understanding how it works. The point of all this is that it helps tremendously in understanding the risk of insufficient transport layer protection because ultimately, it’s websites that don’t do a good enough job of this that put the victim at risk. More on that later.</p>  <p>But why on earth would a victim connect to the Pineapple in the first place?! Well firstly, we’ve become alarmingly accustomed to connecting to random wireless access points whilst we’re out and about. When the average person is at the airport waiting for a flight and sees an SSID named “Free Airport Wi-Fi”, what are they going to do? Assume it’s an attacker’s honeypot and stay away from it or believe that it’s free airport Wi-Fi and dive right in? Exactly.</p>  <p>But of course that’s still a very conscious decision on behalf of the user. As it turns out, the Pineapple packs a much more subversive party trick to lure unsuspecting victims in…</p>  <h4>Karma, baby</h4>  <p>The Karma feature is best explained on the Pineapple website:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most wireless devices including laptops, tablets and smartphones have network software that automatically connects to access points they remember. This convenient feature is what gets you online without effort when you turn on your computer at home, the office, coffee shops or airports you frequent. Simply put, when your computer turns on, the wireless radio sends out probe requests. These requests say &quot;Is such-and-such wireless network around?&quot; The WiFi Pineapple Mark IV, powered by Jasager -- German for &quot;The Yes Man&quot; -- replies to these requests to say &quot;Sure, I&#39;m such-and-such wireless access point - let&#39;s get you online!&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Wait, what?! So devices just randomly connect to the Pineapple thinking it’s a legitimate AP? Yep, here it is in detail:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Karma saying it is the device's preferred network\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Qzxq_7EMKgo/UW53-B56MfI/AAAAAAAAFHU/NtElaw8-04c/are-you-my-network3.jpg?imgmax=800\" width=\"525\" height=\"159\" /></p>  <p>Simple, huh? The problem is that wireless devices are just too damn trusting. Once they establish a connection with an access point they <em>usually</em> happily reconnect to it at a later date. Of course they need to have the right wireless credentials, but the Pineapple asks for no such thing, it just lets the device straight in whether the access point it <em>thinks </em>it’s connecting to requires them or not.</p>  <p>So that’s how she works, a combination of simply providing an access point that victims connect to on their own free will or being tricked into connecting via Karma. Let’s get it setup and see it all in action.</p>  <h4>Windows tethering</h4>  <p>The easiest way to access the device and get started with configuring everything is to tether it to a PC with two network interfaces. This can be one with a couple of NICs connected to Ethernet or in most cases (and as with the diagram above), a laptop which commonly has a wired NIC <em>and</em> a wireless one.</p>  <p>What we’re going to do is configure the wired Ethernet NIC which we’ll plug the Pineapple into then share the connection on the wireless adapter so that the traffic from the Pineapple can be routed through it, effectively just passing everything through the PC. This is all pretty straight forward and it starts out from the Network Connections settings:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Network Connections in Windows\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MrWEcS1Szes/UW53-v7pSLI/AAAAAAAAFHc/V9l3ORe0txw/image31.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"580\" height=\"274\" /></p>  <p>Just one little note before proceeding: I’m going to obfuscate any SSIDs or MAC addresses used in this post with a grey box simply because they explicitly tie back to my devices (or my neighbours’ devices!) and I’m not real keen on publicly identifying them. Who knows what they might get up to in future…</p>  <p>Jump into the properties of the wireless adapter, and head over to the sharing tab then make sure that “Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection” is checked:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ahGCiZf2N6o/UW53_OAAKMI/AAAAAAAAFHk/P_8ZGT8MoXA/image6111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>That’s that adapter done, now let’s do the wired one. Jump into the properties locate the “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” item:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vWzxt9B5TYU/UW53_x2uSyI/AAAAAAAAFHs/fl24-K_7dkY/image12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>Now grab the properties of that guy and configure a static IP address and subnet mask <em>and</em> set the DNS server as follows:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Static IP address on 172.16.42.42, subnet mask on 255.255.255.0 and DNS on 8.8.8.8\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4jNWAZx8KCo/UW54AdNGHeI/AAAAAAAAFH0/5hiuTx1QbaQ/image9111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"414\" height=\"462\" /></p>  <p>That’s it – job done.</p>  <h4>Accessing the device</h4>  <p>Once tethering is setup and the Pineapple is connected to Ethernet via its PoE LAN port, you should be able to access the Pineapple directly from within your browser via the IP address. You can hit it on <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a> or if running a newer version of the firmware (more on that later), the IP address and port <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a>. All things going well, you’ll be challenged to authenticate:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Authenticating to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RqMYWB-9wT8/UW54BDza6jI/AAAAAAAAFH8/Rt5gJfm-_Vg/image91.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"354\" /></p>  <p>The default credentials are username “root” and password “pineapplesareyummy” after which you should be in:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The Pineapple browser UI\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-f4hrR9qhYN0/UW54BponcHI/AAAAAAAAFIE/x_al0IFp3lQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"498\" /></p>  <p>That’s the first bit done, tethering is working and we can actually access the device, now for a bit of preparation.</p>  <h4>Housekeeping</h4>  <p>Before you start anything, get the firmware up to date. If I’m honest, I’m always scared about updating any firmware on any device because when it goes wrong it’s often a whole world of pain to get yourself back out of trouble again. You’re much better off doing this before you create any dependencies on the device or configure anything. I had a couple of glitches doing mine and it took a few goes, but in theory, you jump over to the “Upgrade” link on the nav, hit “Check for Upgrades” then if required, pull down a package, enter the MD5 hash of it (provided on the upgrade site) and upload the package:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The upgrade interface\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-TKEVg68nZ2A/UW54CbftvRI/AAAAAAAAFIM/_NXzcxzWqtc/image26.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"712\" height=\"513\" /></p>  <p>One little thing you want to remember here: if like me, your GUI was originally accessed via <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a>, keep in mind the newer version of the firmware now puts the GUI behind a port so you want to hit <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a> instead. If, also like me, you try hitting the old address after the install and reboot you’ll keep getting redirected and not much will happen. Then you’ll think you’ve rooted your device (that’s the <a href=\"http://www.koalanet.com.au/australian-slang.html#R\">Australian rooted</a>, not the American one) and start wondering how in the hell you’re ever going to get it back to a known good state and, well, just remember the port change!</p>  <p>Next up, jump into configuration and change the default SSID. The device is configured to show “pineapple” followed by the first and last octets of the Wi-Fi adapter. Change it to something a little more subtle and make it persistent so that when you fire it back up later you’re not reverting to the default:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the SSID\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VAgzd-49TAk/UW54CwthWoI/AAAAAAAAFIU/F5tYyHk3F7o/image23.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"720\" height=\"338\" /></p>  <p>The other thing you want to do on the configuration page is to blacklist the MAC address of the machine you’re going to be orchestrating the Pineapple from <em>and any other devices you don’t want inadvertently connecting to it</em>. This is important if you don’t want to “Pineapple yourself”! Seriously though, it can get very confusing otherwise so this makes good sense.</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Blacklisting a MAC address\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Rp_vhB-NHqI/UW54DRCqcDI/AAAAAAAAFIc/T5ZjW4R7kzM/image17.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"333\" /></p>  <p>Lastly, let’s change that default password, the last thing you want is someone else taking over your Pineapple whilst you’re pretending to be a l33t hax0r! Over to the “Advanced” link then down to the bottom of the page:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the default password\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rA8hdZFTMw4/UW54EZwq6BI/AAAAAAAAFIk/pozoVdObfFg/image61.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"714\" height=\"200\" /></p>  <p>That’s pretty much it for what I felt need to be configured via the UI, let’s go and get a bit low-level and enter the command shell.</p>  <h4>SSH’ing in</h4>  <p>This is where it gets a bit scary for Windows people! Keeping in mind that the Pineapple is ultimately just a little Linux box with some fancy party tricks, there are times when you’ll need to get your hands dirty and enter the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">secure shell</a> world. This is something I do very, very rarely and if memory serves me correctly, it was 1999 when I last regularly used a *nix machine so it was pretty unfamiliar territory for me as well.</p>  <p>Moving on, one of the easiest way of SSH’ing into the device from Windows is to go and grab <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">PuTTY</a>. With this in hand, the only configuration you need is the IP address of the device:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Using PuTTY to SSH into the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mQzJffwbX7g/UW54E-SHBzI/AAAAAAAAFIs/nARezcNK-Ck/image2.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"466\" height=\"449\" /></p>  <p>Open the connection and you’re into the shell:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Into SSH mode on the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-IsVt6YIzU28/UW54FxLZuaI/AAAAAAAAFI0/GSfYRkYatz4/image5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"425\" /></p>  <p>Follow the instructions in the screen above enough times and suddenly the shell doesn’t seem to look so bad!</p>  <p>Keep in mind that this is the OpenWrt distro of Linux and being intended for embedded devices, it’s a pretty lean edition. Don’t expect to find all the features you’d normally see in a full blown desktop edition – many of them are not there so keep that in mind when attempting to use commands that might not be supported.</p>  <p>Once you’re SSH’d in you can go ahead and set the time and time zone correctly. This’ll be well outside your comfort zone if Linux shells are a bit foreign to you (and admittedly I had to look much of this up again), so here’s the whole thing step-by-step:</p>  <ol>   <li>Change the directory to /etc/config: <em>cd /etc/config</em> </li>    <li>Edit the config file in vi: <em>vi config</em> </li>    <li>Navigate down to the “option timezone” line and delete out the existing “UTC” value (unless, of course, you are in the UTC time zone!)</li>    <li>Jump over to the <a href=\"http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system#time.zones\">timezones table on the OpenWrt site</a> and find the appropriate one for your location. </li>    <li>Enter the value from the “TZ string” column into the shell: <em>Hit the “i” key to insert then type away        <br>        <br></em>It should look kinda like this when you’re done:       <br>      <br><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"New timezone\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hKmnGCZ_-Z4/UW54GbRSUHI/AAAAAAAAFI8/pXxnh3S6bJ4/image29.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"143\" />       <br></li>    <li>Save the file: <em>Hit the esc key to stop editing then :w!&lt;enter&gt;</em> </li>    <li>Reboot the Pineapple: <em>reboot &lt;enter&gt;</em> </li> </ol>  <p>A little tip for new players: every time I tried saving the config change I got the following message and nothing actually saved:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Error when saving timezone\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0GOv_BhRu38/UW54Gy29ySI/AAAAAAAAFJE/C-d5958YpJw/image32.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"674\" height=\"114\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, means that there is no available capacity on the device and after wasting considerable time trying to work out why I couldn’t use vi correctly, this become quite clear. Welcome to Linux!</p>  <h4>Working with ext4 format and USB drives</h4>  <p>You’ve got <em>very</em> little space on the device, there’s literally only an 8MB ROM and 32MB of RAM so by the time you load everything into there just required for the device to run, there’ve not much left. It’s <em>certainly</em> not going to be enough to start doing fancy things like storing packet captures which mount up very quickly.</p>  <p>Fortunately it’s all expandable via USB so one of the first things you want to do is grab a spare thumb drive and get it ready for the Pineapple. But there’s a catch – as with many things Linux, this is a slightly different world to good old Windows so you can’t just take your NTFS formatted USB stick and chuck it in, you’ll need to partition it for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4\">ext4</a>.</p>  <p>In theory, this is easy enough to do in the Windows world using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html\">MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>. That sounds just fine – except it’s not and you will only discover this through either banging your head against the wall for hours or reading what comes next. Whilst the aforementioned tool (and I assume others like it running on Windows) <em>seemed</em> like a good idea, I just couldn’t get it to play nice. I’ll spare you the detail as <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/29269-cant-install-infusions-to-usb/\">I’ve captured them all on the Hak5 forum</a>, but in short, the USB would mount and be readable from shell but I could never install Infusions to it (think of them as apps for the Pineapple) which I’ll come to shortly. It turns out that additional partitions were being created and that simply made things not play nice with the Pineapple despite no obvious warnings to that effect.</p>  <p>The solution turns out to be that I needed to create the ext4 partition directly from a Linux machine. If this world is unfamiliar to you, there’s a (relatively) low friction process courtesy of an <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download\">Ubuntu LiveCD</a>. This involves downloading an Ubuntu ISO, burning it to CD (or DVD or bootable USB), running up an in-memory instance of Ubuntu and partitioning the USB from there. I then followed the guidance provided in the very easy to follow page on <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?showtopic=25882\">enabling USB mass storage with swap partition</a> as the swap partition looks like will come in handy later on when you want to start doing some other tricks with the Pineapple. </p>  <p>That sounds like a hassle – running up an entire new operating system just to partition a USB drive – and certainly it was a drama getting to the point of realising that’s what I needed to do, but once you know what needs to be done it’s quite simple. Of course it would have been even simpler if I had a handy Linux machine hanging around somewhere and for many people, that will already be the case.</p>  <p>Once it’s all setup you should see the storage appear under the “USB” menu item like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"USB drive listed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OyXhJQmJRDw/UW54HV-pLZI/AAAAAAAAFJM/holkRYdmC6k/image3.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"90\" /></p>  <p>You’ll also probably want to <em>read </em>from the drive back on your Windows machine at some point (I’ll save some packet captures to it a little later on) and I found <a href=\"http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\">DiskInternals Linux Reader</a> did the job just fine.</p>  <h4>Testing connectivity</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got everything ready to roll, let’s jump into the fun stuff! Back in that first screen grab of the UI, only the “Wireless” and “Cron Jobs” services were running so let’s fire up “Mk4 Karma” and set it to run automatically via the “Autostart” feature so the device just needs to be powered up for everything to kick into action:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Enabling services\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-a67G5cz08ks/UW54Ica8qvI/AAAAAAAAFJU/nLL9fBU7rSQ/image3111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"310\" height=\"203\" /></p>  <p>Now we should be able to jump over to a device such as my iPhone and see some new SSIDs:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"iPhone seeing the &quot;trust me&quot; SSID\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5q0080Y7Gxs/UW54JE1ClwI/AAAAAAAAFJc/KdwNlfVxkFA/Photo-14-04-13-11-18-252.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" /></p>  <p>This is a whole lot more interesting once you understand what’s under the grey box (which again, I’ve deliberately obfuscated), so let me explain what’s happening; each unsecured network is the Pineapple responding to a probe request from the iPhone with the name of the SSID it was previously associated with. The names include that of an old wireless router I replaced some years back, my parents’ network I was connected to interstate just the other day and an airline lounge in a far flung corner of the world. All of the <em>secured</em> networks are legitimate (mine, my neighbour’s, etc.)</p>  <p>We’re also seeing the new SSID of the Pineapple that I set earlier (“trust me”) and I’ve gone ahead and explicitly connected to that for demonstration purposes. This now makes the homepage of the GUI much more interesting:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of probe requests from and MAC addresses from different devices\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ePipCAVZmE8/UW54Juv-1lI/AAAAAAAAFJk/WYnTwU-1HPU/image611.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"713\" height=\"599\" /></p>  <p>What’s particularly interesting is what you <em>can’t</em> see which are all the SSIDs being probed for. These are predominantly APs I’ve connected to in the past and the MAC addresses doing the probing are predominantly my own (the Wi-Fi strength on the Pineapple is not great so I’m seeing mostly nearby devices), but you do see a few unfamiliar ones pop up which are clearly other people’s devices. It does make you wonder what risks might be present from devices leaking SSID names they’ve previously associated to; “Why is my colleague’s Android trying to connect to ‘Mistress Angeliques BDSM Palace’?!”</p>  <p>Anyway, right at the end of the above image you can see the association of my iPhone to the Pineapple which means we can now drill down and get a detailed report of what’s going on:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Details of iPhone connected to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-z7CXdB9cc7k/UW54KBKjGrI/AAAAAAAAFJs/ssKRCsBIclI/image911.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"717\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>This is mostly self-explanatory, the signal strength is kind of interesting as it starts to give you a sense of the distance the victim might be from the device. Of course what will be really interesting is the rx bytes – that’s about one a half MB that the phone has already received through the Pineapple and under normal operating conditions, the user would have absolutely no idea there was an MiTM. Let’s move on to taking a sneaky look at those packets because that’s where things get <em>really</em> interesting!</p>  <h4>Packet capturing</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got all the nuts and bolts in place, let’s start capturing the data. There are a couple of different ways of doing this and probably the simplest is to monitor the traffic moving through the Ethernet adapter on the attacker’s PC. Once we start getting into the realm of traffic monitoring we need to start looking at packets and the best way to do this on a PC by a long shot is to use <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>.</p>  <p>One of the best thing about Wireshark is that it’s free. This is no lightweight tool either, Wireshark is very full featured and is arguably the de facto standard for monitoring, capturing and analysing packets flying around a network. As powerful as Wireshark is, it’s also relatively easy to get started, just fire it up, choose the network interface you want to capture which in this case is the Ethernet adaptor (remember, this is the NIC the Pineapple is connected to) then jump down to the “Capture Options” button:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Starting Wireshark to monitor traffic from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Ne7YzDpxoko/UW54LRVwyaI/AAAAAAAAFJ0/DFFgZL3q0ts/image4111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>The capture options start to give you an idea of the extent of the configurability but we’ll just leave all that as default and start the capture:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark capture options\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1R7_UMzEj1c/UW54L4rCwGI/AAAAAAAAFJ8/7mXK80MYCPo/image7111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"595\" height=\"614\" /></p>  <p>Once started, you should immediately begin to see packets flowing through the NIC:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark packets captured from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Bl64viP2Stg/UW54N9mwJTI/AAAAAAAAFKE/yrDLyCFjSiA/image14.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>Right about here the penny should drop – <em>this is someone else’s traffic!</em> Ok, it’s really my own traffic from my iPhone but of course as we now know, the Pineapple has the ability to easily trick a victim into connecting to it whether deliberately or by default as their device looks for familiar SSIDs. Long story short is that this could just as easily be someone else’s traffic.</p>  <p>I’m not going to delve into exactly what we can do with that traffic right now because I have subsequent posts planned that will demonstrate that, for now though let’s just filter that traffic down to something a bit more familiar – HTTP. You see, the traffic above includes a whole bunch of different protocols which for the purposes of talking about secure website design aren’t going to be of much use. Let’s add in a filter of “http” and load up a popular website with developers:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"HTTP requests to Stack Overflow being captured\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GSblfy9jCsQ/UW54PygDQPI/AAAAAAAAFKM/eplvQ037mnM/image211.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"621\" /></p>  <p>As I’ve written before, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/is-stack-overflow-secure-kind-of.html\">Stack Overflow serves everything outside the logon over HTTP</a> so it’s easy to monitor that traffic (including the authentication cookie). Once the traffic is captured, you can either save it as a PCAP file for later analysis or right click and follow the TCP stream which then gets you into the entire request and response (including the headers with those valuable auth cookies):</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Following the TCP stream of the request and response\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-UZURZFz9TJc/UW54QscUzZI/AAAAAAAAFKU/rVXZQMurshc/image241.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>I’ll stop there because that’s enough to demonstrate that everything is working as expected. Just to illustrate the power of the Pineapple, as I was writing this piece and watching the Wireshark traffic, a whole bunch of packets started appearing <em>that weren’t mine</em>:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"My wife's MacBook Air connecting to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-MoH38Mcz4KA/UW54RaXPubI/AAAAAAAAFKc/0UvZcHcG5nk/image171.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"160\" /></p>  <p>Turns out that my wife had wondered into range with her MacBook Air and it had automatically associated to the SSID “Apple Demo” which I can only assume is the access point the Apple store connected her to when walking her through the shiny new machine she recently bought. So there you go – right out of the box a brand new machine is already falling victim to the Pineapple without even trying.</p>  <h4>Infusions and unattended packet capturing with tcpdump</h4>  <p>This is the last configuration I want to touch on simply because it covers couple of important points: Infusions and using the USB drive we setup earlier. With these concepts understood I actually feel reasonably well-equipped to use the thing so they’re worth capturing here.</p>  <p>The physical capabilities of the Pineapple should be pretty clear by now but what might not be quite as clear to the uninitiated is what can now be achieved with clever software. I’ll write a lot more about these capabilities in the future but for now I want to just take a quick look at the concept of <a href=\"http://wifipineapple.com/index.php?infusions\">Infusions</a>.</p>  <p>Think of Infusions as apps and the Pineapple Bar as an app store for the Pineapple only with a couple of dozen apps that are all free. The Infusions cover a variety of different domains from informational to potentially malicious so there’s a good range of use cases in there. It’s accessible via the Pineapple from the “Pineapple Bar” link in the nav and it gives you some options like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of Infusions\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-eIMW9VFasvA/UW54SPQA8qI/AAAAAAAAFKk/1gvCCWC7gZk/image6111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"743\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>As you can see, I’ve already installed the “status” Infusion and by way of example, here’s the sort of info you get from it:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The status Infusion\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-srCGdSOFli8/UW54ShItYdI/AAAAAAAAFKs/-L_Dp0JraFY/image%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"552\" height=\"899\" /></p>  <p>This can be pretty handy info in GUI format, there are also some neat real time graphs for things like CPU utilisation and bandwidth:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-24EGoXWguCE/UW54TAa4iKI/AAAAAAAAFK0/AYw5xOzSa7E/image9.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"602\" height=\"378\" /></p>  <p>The really interesting one, however, is <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">tcpdump</a>. Now tcpdump is not an Infusion in and of itself, it’s an existing project which has been turned into an Infusion so that’s easily installable on the Pineapple and can then be managed from the GUI. What tcpdump offers is the ability to effectively do what we just did with Wireshark in terms of packet capturing but to do so locally within the device itself. What this means is that you can have the Pineapple independently capture traffic without needing to run Wireshark on a PC. In fact if you establish a connection from the Pineapple directly to the web (and there are several ways to do this), you don’t need a PC at all. Imagine just that little cigarette pack sized Pineapple sitting there on its own with its own power source and internet connection and any victims within Wi-Fi shot of it automatically connecting and having their packets captured. <em>That’s</em> powerful stuff.</p>  <p>Now that we have a <em>correctly partitioned</em> USB drive, Infusions can be installed directly to there:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-p2d5NmTXU4I/UW54T9tY7rI/AAAAAAAAFK8/yTU-9FnizB0/image9111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"586\" height=\"122\" /></p>  <p>Incidentally, it’s that highlighted “USB Storage” link that I never saw when creating the ext4 partition in Windows.</p>  <p>The thing with packet captures is that there can be a lot of them and they can chew up space <em>really</em> quickly depending on how liberal you are with the data you want to save. You can configure tcpdump to filter out a lot of the “noise” packets and restrict it to, say, only HTTP traffic or even just only to HTTP requests using the POST verb. For now though we’ll just run it up with the defaults to capture all the traffic running through the wired LAN port:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Capturing TCP traffic using tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-77Z5GhmZBm8/UW54UqTp_kI/AAAAAAAAFLE/x3ZCtGyPjX0/image4.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"543\" /></p>  <p>You can now sit back and let the traffic flow whilst the Pineapple captures everything anyone connected to it sends across the wire (or air, as it may be). With the iPhone connected, I browsed over to a site I know doesn’t properly protect user credentials and attempted to logon. Once done you can hit “Stop” and you’ll see a summary of the captured data:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Captured packets from tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UxrDrz2Qzco/UW54VGgpXcI/AAAAAAAAFLM/sy1YgW14H4w/image%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"699\" height=\"130\" /></p>  <p>No we can jump over to the “History” tab and download the PCAP file:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Viewing the tcpdump history\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-klhWubPTmv8/UW54Viwfy-I/AAAAAAAAFLU/FVTKcrnkZ5s/image%25255B6%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"394\" height=\"121\" /></p>  <p>That PCAP file is just the same as what we captured in Wireshark earlier on and you can now load it back up into Wireshark and analyse it in just the same way as you would the packets it captured directly. Alternatively, you can pull the USB out, chuck it into the PC and read it with a tool like DiskInternals which I mentioned earlier. Here’s what we can now see from my brief visit to the site</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Login credentials sent in unprotected GET request\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ITtGPmF44CI/UW54W8TMdNI/AAAAAAAAFLc/Uh1B4iBHQZo/image%25255B9%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>This site is <em>particularly</em> bad because the credentials just go into a GET request but of course the real story in the context of the Pineapple is that the whole thing is sent in the clear so it’s now easy to see everything sent by the victim and returned by the server. Keep in mind that this was all captured directly on the Pineapple (or at least on the USB) so the whole thing is now pretty well self-contained. That’s a good place to end the traffic capture for today, there’ll be <em>much</em> more in the future though…</p>  <h4>Other miscellaneous info</h4>  <p>For those of you thinking of getting yourself into a Pineapple (and I know there are a few based on Twitter chats alone), there are a couple of pre-purchase things worth pointing out. Firstly, I went el-cheapo and only got the device itself without any accessories. This means you get an AC adaptor for power and that’s it so it’s definitely <em>not </em>mobile.</p>  <p>Being able to take the Pineapple out in the wild definitely presents all sorts of opportunities not available while it’s plugged in to the mains so the <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/accessory/products/usb-battery-pack-3200mah\">USB battery pack</a> is a must. As the name suggests, this also gives you the ability to power the device directly from USB so you can just plug it into your laptop if the juice in the battery runs out.</p>  <p>The other thing is that the Wi-Fi strength is pretty ordinary. By way of example, here’s how <a href=\"http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/\">inSSIDer</a> sees the Pineapple (in yellow, of course) versus my usual access point in blue from only about a foot away:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-PeooN0RcNQo/UW542mkm8rI/AAAAAAAAFLk/vtbIKh5vBsE/image72.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>However, mover into the next room and the Pineapple just about drops off altogether:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-jaf-526cP-Y/UW543Cy7n2I/AAAAAAAAFLs/e4AQkrZDXro/image1011.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>There are <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/antennas\">a few different antenna options</a> so if your intended use doesn’t involve connecting to a target within a very, very close distance then this would be worth a look. Other than that though, the only other thing that <em>might</em> be useful is a handy case and given HakShop has <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple-holiday-bundle\">a Pineapple with battery and a case going for $115</a> at the time of writing, that’s probably your best bet.</p>  <p>The other thing that some people might find interesting is that a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/killuminati2012/wifipineapple/wiki\">the code running on the Pineapple is up on GitHub</a>. This is apparently the www folder of the device so it’s not the firmware itself, but it is a bunch of the PHP files and scripts which is kind of interesting to have a browse through.</p>  <h4>Responsible use</h4>  <p>I bought the Pineapple for the sole purpose of helping developers better understand the risks of insufficient transport layer security. You’re going to see me writing a lot more about the risks of loading logon forms over HTTP, embedding HTTPS login forms in HTTP pages, mixed mode HTTP / HTTPS and other similar risks. The Pineapple will help me move that discussion from a theoretical “An attacker might do this or could do that” to a very practical “Here, let me show you exactly why that pattern is risky”. Demonstrations of this kind are very powerful and they’re often the only way of getting the message through.</p>  <p>However, there is very clearly scope for misuse and abuse of unsuspecting victims. That incident I mentioned earlier where my wife walked into the room and suddenly I was watching <em>her</em> network traffic is a perfect example of how easy it is to do potentially evil things, sometimes without even trying. For those reading this and considering how they might use it, there are some great use cases for penetration testing or demoing (in)secure web app design but there is also some very, very thin ice out there. Caveat emptor.</p>  <h4>What next for the Pineapple?</h4>  <p>The great thing about the Pineapple is that it makes it dead easy to demonstrate a whole bunch of concepts that I often write about but haven’t always shown in execution. For example, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html\">why it’s not ok to load login forms over HTTP even if they post to HTTPS</a>. Another one that has come up a few times (including in <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">the Top CashBack post</a>) is not embedding a login form that <em>is</em> loaded over HTTPS within an iframe in an HTTP page. There’s a whole heap of things that will be easily demonstrated within a controlled environment.</p>  <p>Then there’s the uncontrolled environment – the public. There’s a lot of grey area there about what can be done for the purposes of research and education without crossing the line into outright eavesdropping and getting on the wrong side of people. I do have some thoughts on it, but I’ll hold onto those for the moment…</p>  <p>Regardless, I’ll start producing some video material to demonstrate the ease with which this thing does its work because it’s immensely impressive to see in real time – at least <em>I</em> was impressed! I’ve already created a bit of video for a training program I’m putting together (more on that another day), and I reckon it comes up great. Stay tuned, there’s much, much more to come.</p>  <h4 align=\"left\">Useful Links</h4>  <ol>   <li><a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/25706-markiv-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know/?hl=%2Bext4+%2Bformatted+%2Busb+%2Bstick\">Markiv: What We Know And What We Don't Know</a> – good general overview of features and configuration </li>    <li><a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/26363-mark-4-setup-script/\">Mark 4 setup script</a> – very handy for seeing how to configure various things via the shell. </li>    <li><a href=\"http://hakinthebox.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/you-just-cant-trust-wireless-covertly.html\">You just can't trust wireless: covertly hijacking wifi and stealing passwords using sslstrip</a> – good view of defeating SSL with the device</li> </ol>  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/GmmL2ItpzB8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/Gd9epuFKI4M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "Troy Hunt") (pubDate nil "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 06:26:00 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TroyHunt/~3/GmmL2ItpzB8/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html")) (item nil (title nil "DevOps Integration Key to Avoiding Pre-Ordained Security Failures") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/4sgkKC0pzYU/devops-integration-key-avoiding-pre-ordained-security-failures-041613") (description nil "<p>BOSTON – Downstream is where you live today as a security person.

<br>
==Description==<br>
<br>
Expression Language (EL) Injection happens when attacker controlled data enters an EL interpreter. <br>
<br>
With EL implementations prior to 2.2, attacker can recover sensitive server side information available through implicit objects. This includes model objects, beans, session scope, application scope, etc. The EL 2.2 spec allows method invocation, which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code within context of the application. This can manipulate application functionality, expose sensitive data, and branch out into system code access-- posing a risk of server compromise.<br>
<br>
A specific pattern exists in certain version of the Spring Framework, where Spring JSP tags will double resolve EL. In versions prior to 3.0.6, it is not possible to disable this functionality, and the pattern must be avoided.<br>
<br>
<br>
==Risk Factors==<br>
<br>
The likelihood of this issue is '''Medium''', for the following reasons:<br>
*Certain attack scenarios are not overly sophisticated, although require some skill.<br>
*Automated tools may begin to pick up on the pattern, increasing the likelihood of discovery. <br>
*Attackers are highly motivated to discover code execution vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
The overall impact of this issue is '''High''', for the following reasons:<br>
* An attacker could modify and invoke functionality on the application server.<br>
* Unauthorized access to data and functionality, as well as account hijacking and remote code execution.<br>
* Confidentiality, and Integrity concerns from a successful attack.<br>
<br>
==Examples==<br>
<br>
=== Spring Message Tag ===<br>
The Spring Message tag will double resolve Expression Language.<br>
<br>
A common pattern of passing URL parameters to the message tag is:<br>
<br>
Controller.java<br>
 @RequestMapping(value=&quot;/&quot;)<br>
    String index() {<br>
    	<br>
    	if ( hasErrors() ) {<br>
    		return &quot;redirect:/error?msg=error.generic&quot;;<br>
    	} else {<br>
    		return &quot;index&quot;;<br>
    	}<br>
    	<br>
    }<br>
<br>
error.jsp<br>
 &lt;spring:message code=&quot;${param.msg}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL request to the above code of the form:<br>
 ?msg=${param.test}&amp;test=INJECTION<br>
<br>
Will result in the string literal &quot;INJECTION&quot; being passed to the message tag. The application should respond with an exception like:<br>
<br>
 No message found under code 'INJECTION' for locale 'en_US'<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the attacker could submit methods within the EL like:<br>
 ?msg=${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;admin&quot;,true)}<br>
<br>
If the container provided EL interpreter does not support static class methods ( java.lang.Runtime.getCurrentRuntime().exec() ), an attacker can use a URLClassLoader to load remote code.<br>
<br>
<br>
=== Spring Eval Tag ===<br>
Spring Framework provides a JSP tag that interprets Spring Expression Language (SpEL).<br>
<br>
The following code would be vulnerable:<br>
 &lt;spring:eval expression=&quot;${param.vulnerable}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL of the following form would provide system code access:<br>
 ?vulnerable=T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(“cmd.exe”)<br>
<br>
<br>

* [[Interpreter Injection]]<br>
<br>
<br>
==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==<br>
<br>
* [[Reflection injection]]<br>
* [[Injection problem]]<br>
<br>
==Related [[Controls]]==<br>
Avoid putting user data into an expression interpreter if possible. Otherwise, validate and/or encode the data to ensure it is not evaluated as expression language.<br>
* [[Input_Validation]]<br>
<br>
In the case of Spring Framework, disable the double resolution functionality in versions 3.0.6 and above by placing the following configuration in the application web.xml.<br>
<br>
    &lt;context-param&gt;<br>
         &lt;description&gt;Spring Expression Language Support&lt;/description&gt;<br>
         &lt;param-name&gt;springJspExpressionSupport&lt;/param-name&gt;<br>
         &lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;<br>

My only worry is that there is SO MUCH to do!!! and Samantha is only one :(<br>
<br>
Last time I spoke with Samantha she was still under the impression that she would only need help in late 2014, I hope that she will soon realize that there are a lot of areas where she could do with more resources (starting with resources to do actual ‘project management’, since at the moment she doesn&#39;t have the time to do that for the projects that really need it)<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DinisCruz/~4/Gof4c9C-4Qo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/u_o3m-J0shc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "Dinis Cruz") (pubDate nil "Sat, 13 Apr 2013 12:49:00 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DinisCruz/~3/Gof4c9C-4Qo/if-you-ever-doubt-that-owasp-needs-more.html")) (item nil (title nil "The problem with SSL is not performance, its management") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/OZyR5XFWyus/the-problem-with-ssl-is-not-performance.html") (description nil "In a chat with <a href=\"http://michaelhidalgocr.blogspot.co.uk/\">Michael Hidalgo</a> about SSL, he mentioned the posts <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html\">Overclocking SSL</a> (from Google), <a href=\"https://devcentral.f5.com/blogs/us/dispelling-the-new-ssl-myth\">Dispelling the New SSL Myth</a> (from F5) and <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/www.imperialviolet.org/2011/02/06/stillinexpensive.html\">Still not computationally expensive</a> (Google guy responding to F5). <br>

And if you read them you will notice that from my point of view, the issue with SSL is not really a performance issue, but a management/workflow one. <br>
<br>
Namely the fact that:<br>
<ul>
<li>SSL requires Development and Infrastructure to work together, </li>
<li>It adds more complexity to the deployment (note how the Azure team is taking a long time to add support for it)</li>
<li>It is still a pain to add SSL support to existing web servers</li>
<li>Management of keys is hard</li>
<li>It is another source of bugs (for an application).</li>
<li>There are a lot of people (and organizations) that really don’t want SSL-everywhere to happen</li>
</ul>
That said, I agree that the time for SSL-Everywhere has come, and we really need to do a better job at protecting our browsing data<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DinisCruz/~4/Ndcqa9v4Bns\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/OZyR5XFWyus\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "Dinis Cruz") (pubDate nil "Sat, 13 Apr 2013 12:28:00 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DinisCruz/~3/Ndcqa9v4Bns/the-problem-with-ssl-is-not-performance.html")) (item nil (title nil "OWASP&#39;s New Executive Director") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/NaEmY-Z6BZY/owasps-new-executive-director.html") (description nil "The OWASP Board is proud to announce OWASP’s new Executive Director, Sarah Baso.<br><br>The OWASP board had many different directions to consider for which type of candidate would be best suited for the new executive director role.

<p>A test like this “doesn't tell you:
<ul><li>What are the potential threats to your application?</li>
<li>Which threats is your application “not vulnerable” to?</li>
<li>Which threats did the testers not assess your application for? Which threats were not possible to test from a runtime perspective?</li>
<li>How did time and other constraints on the test affect the reliability of results? For example, if the testers had 5 more days, what other security tests would they have executed?</li>
<li>What was the skill level of the testers and would you get the same set of results from a different tester or another consultancy?”</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Sethi stresses the importance of setting expectations and defining requirements for pen testing. An outside pen tester will not be able to understand your business requirements or the internals of the system well enough to do a comprehensive job – unless maybe if your app is yet another straightforward online portal or web store written in PHP or Ruby on Rails, something that they have seen many times before. </p>

<p>You should assume that pen testers will miss something, possibly a lot, and there’s no way of knowing what they didn't test or how good a job they actually did on what they did test. You could try <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DefectSeeding\">defect seeding</a> to get some idea of how careful and smart they were (and how many bugs they didn’t find), but this assumes that you know an awful lot about your system and about security and security testing (and if you’re this good, you probably don’t need their help). Turning on <a href=\"http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2012/05/pursuit-of-protection-how-much-testing.html\">code coverage analysis</a> during the test will tell you what parts of the code didn't get touched – but it won’t help you identify the code that you didn't write but should have, which is often a bigger problem when it comes to security.</p>

<p>You can’t expect a pen tester to find all of the security vulnerabilities in your system – even if you are willing to spend a lot of time and money on it. But pen tests are important because this is a way to find things that are hard for you to find on your own:<ol>
<li>
Technology-specific and platform-specific vulnerabilities 
</li>
<li>
Configuration and deployment mistakes in the run-time environment
</li>
<li>
Pointy-Hat problems in areas like authentication and session management that should have been taken care of by the framework that you are using, if it works and if you are using it properly
</li>
<li>
Fussy problems in information leakage, object enumeration and error handling – problems that look small to you but can be exploited by an intelligent and motivated attacker with time on their side
</li>
<li>
Mistakes in data validation or output encoding and filtering, that look small to you but…
</li>
</ol>
And if you’re lucky, some other problems that you should have caught on your own but didn’t, like weaknesses in workflow or access control or password management or a race condition.</p>


<h2>Pen testing is about information, not about vulnerabilities</h2>

The <a href=\"http://software-security.sans.org/blog/2012/03/28/whats-the-point-of-application-pen-testing/\">real point of pen testing</a>, or any other kind of testing, is not to find all of the bugs in a system. It is <a href=\"http://swreflections.blogspot.ca/2012/04/you-dont-need-testers-or-do-you.html\">to get information</a>.
<ol><li>
Information on <b>examples</b> of bugs in the application that need to be reviewed and fixed, how they were found, and how serious they are.
</li>
<li>
Information that you can use to calibrate your development practices and controls, to understand just how good (or not good) you are at building software. 
</li></ol>

<blockquote>Testing doesn't provide all possible information, but it provides some. Good testing will provide lots of useful information.
<a href=\"http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/236\">James Bach (Satisfice)</a></blockquote>

<p>This information leads to questions: How many other bugs like this could there be in the code? Where else should we look for bugs, and what other kinds of bugs or weaknesses could there be in the code or the design? Where did these bugs come from in the first place? Why did we make that mistake? What didn't we know or what didn't we understand? Why didn't we catch the problems earlier? What do we need to do to prevent them or to catch them in the future? If the bugs are serious enough, or there are enough of them, this means going all the way <a href=\"http://swreflections.blogspot.com/2011/06/moving-forward-from-failure.html\">through RCA</a> and exercises like <a href=\"http://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/\">5 Whys</a> to understand and address Root Cause.</p>

<p>To get high-quality information, you need to share information with pen testers. Give the pen tester as much information as possible
<ul>
<li>Walk through the app with pen testers, hilight the important functions, and provide documentation</li>
<li>Take time to explain the architecture and platform</li>
<li>Share results of previous pen tests</li>
<li>Provide access behind proxies etc</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Ask them for information in return: ask them to explain their findings as well as their approach, what they tried and what they covered in their tests and what they didn't, where they spent most of their time, what problems they ran into and where they wasted time, what confused them and what surprised them. Information that you can use to improve your own testing, and to make pen testing more efficient and more effective in the future.</p>

<p>When you’re hiring a pen tester, you’re paying for information. But it’s your responsibility to get as much good information as possible, to understand it and to use it properly.</p>

In order to accomplish this we worked with the QA team at Mozilla to create a simple tool called Garmr to integrate automated security test cases as part of our continuous integration (CI) processes.</p>
<p>When we started the discussion about which tools to use, our requirements were pretty straightforward; it needed to be fast, simple, and accurate.  When we looked at Selenium and Mozmill the feedback we got from other teams is that although powerful, these frameworks were complex to configure properly, and had significant overhead to maintain as a project progresses.  Since the focus was on testing web applications in a repeatable fashion, we identified a set of required functionality and David Burns from the very awesome Mozilla QA team put together the Garmr prototype and initial test cases.</p>
<p>Garmr has been public since its initial version, but the tool has now reached the point where we will start to leverage it in our testing and CI processes.  The tool works by running a series of tests against target URLs and reporting back the results.  The results are currently formatted as a JUnit style XML report that can be consumed by other tools such as Jenkins.</p>
<h2>Garmr Test Cases</h2>
<p>Garmr currently supports two types of test cases that can be authored, an Active Test and a Passive Test.  ActiveTests are expected to make at least one HTTP request, and return the most relevant HTTP response after the check is completed.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an ActiveTest that makes a simple HTTP GET request:</p>

<div><div><pre><span>class</span> WebTouch<span>(</span>ActiveTest<span>)</span>:
    run_passives = <span>True</span>
    description = <span>&quot;Make a GET request to the specified URL, and check for a 200 response after resolving redirects.&quot;</span>
    <span>def</span> do_test<span>(</span><span>self</span>, url<span>)</span>:
        response = requests.<span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> response.<span>status_code</span> == <span>200</span>:
            result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Pass&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;The request returned an HTTP 200 response.&quot;</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>:
            result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Fail&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;The response code was %s&quot;</span> <span>%</span> response.<span>status_code</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span>result, response<span>)</span></pre></div></div>

<p>The test case makes an HTTP Get request, and passes or fails dependent on the response code.  This very basic check does serve a purpose; it grabs an HTTP response to run passive tests against.  For an example of a more complex check, look at the StsUpgradeCheck implemented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr/blob/master/Garmr/corechecks.py\">corechecks</a> module.</p>
<p>PassiveTest instances receive a copy of an HTTP response and analyze it to determine if the test passes or fails.  In most circumstances, Garmr will run all of the configured PassiveTests against the result of each ActiveTest.  The goal of a passive test is to inspect each the response of a query for properties that are expected from a secure web application.</p>
<p>This is an example of a passive test that checks an HTTP response for the presence of X-Frame-Options headers:</p>

<div><div><pre><span>class</span> XFrameOptionsPresent<span>(</span>PassiveTest<span>)</span>:
    description = <span>&quot;Check if X-Frame-Options header is present.&quot;</span>
    <span>def</span> analyze<span>(</span><span>self</span>, response<span>)</span>:
        xfoheader = <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options&quot;</span>
        xfo = xfoheader <span>in</span> response.<span>headers</span>
        <span>if</span> xfo == <span>False</span>:
            result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Fail&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options header not found.&quot;</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>:
            result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Pass&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options header present.&quot;</span>, response.<span>headers</span><span>[</span>xfoheader<span>]</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> result</pre></div></div>

<p>The goal is to allow developers to create test cases that are specific to their applications and gain the benefit of running pedantic checks for security related attributes such as cookies and headers each step of the way.  Note that there is no practical limitation on what a passive check does, as long as the result object is returned properly.</p>
<h2>Using Garmr</h2>
<p>The current version of Garmr can be downloaded from the Github repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr\">https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr</a>.</p>
<p>Getting, installing, and using Garmr is very easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><span>git</span> clone https:<span>//</span>github.com<span>/</span>ygjb<span>/</span>Garmr.git
<span>cd</span> Garmr
<span>sudo</span> python setup.py <span>install</span>
garmr <span>-u</span> http:<span>//</span>my.target.app</pre></div></div>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Garmr is an alpha tool.  The only part of it that we expect to remain stable at this point is the Xml Report format that it produces, since this is specified by the Jenkins tool chain that we are integrating with.</p>
<p>This tool is not intended to replace a typical dynamic or static analysis tool any more than the existence of Unit Tests replaces end to end functional testing, but it does provide a simple facility for QA, development, and security teams to collaborate on web application testing.</p>
<p>Currently the tool can be used to run a number of simple tests, and supports the ability to load modules; two examples of how a module would be written are included in djangochecks.py and webchecks.py</p>
<p>There is a list of features still to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>less noisy CLI</li>
<li>proxy support (already supported in requests)</li>
<li>sessions (controlled; sequence for active tests, with a cookie jar that is propagated through the session)</li>
<li>detailed reporting, including the ability to record all HTTP requests and responses generated</li>
<li>the ability to filter which passive checks are run by check name or by check type (i.e. cookies, headers, content-type, etc)</li>
<li>support for additional protocols (websockets, spdy)</li>
<li>Implement instances of each test case for each target scanned to allow them to retain state as a set of tests progresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very excited to see how the tool will develop over the next few months as we have an intern who will be working to implement these and other features, so please test it out, give us feedback (patches and feature requests are welcome too!).</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/Qqy94ugw28A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "yboily") (pubDate nil "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 22:34:19 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "https://blog.mozilla.com/webappsec/2011/10/26/automating-test-cases/")) (item nil (title nil "Researchers Find &quot;Massive&quot; Security Flaws in Cloud Architectures - CSO Online - Security and Risk") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/CjGun8kMVOk/researchers-find-massive-security-flaws-in-cloud-architectures") (description nil "<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/CjGun8kMVOk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "(author unknown)") (pubDate nil "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 17:26:08 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.csoonline.com/article/692565/researchers-find-massive-security-flaws-in-cloud-architectures?source=rss_news")) (item nil (title nil "Private Sector Data Breaches Up 58 Percent") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/pbN0IKhYwP8/private-sector-data-breaches-up-58-percent") (description nil "Awareness of obligations increases, but is it being translated into action?<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/pbN0IKhYwP8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "(author unknown)") (pubDate nil "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 00:00:00 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://www.csoonline.com/article/692566/private-sector-data-breaches-up-58-percent?source=rss_news")) (item nil (title nil "Securing Mobile Data at the Application Layer") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/IUwSKvfT1ww/securing_mobile_data_at_the_application_layer") (description nil "<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/IUwSKvfT1ww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "(author unknown)") (pubDate nil "Sun, 23 Oct 2011 20:32:11 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://blogs.csoonline.com/1769/securing_mobile_data_at_the_application_layer")) (item nil (title nil "Researchers find way to tighten control over mobile device data") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/o-nbRv35F2U/researchers-find-way-to-tighten-control-over-mobile-device-data") (description nil "The technology focuses on securing data and applications rather than the device.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/o-nbRv35F2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "George V.

<b>Abstract</b>. Attack-aware software applications provide attack detection and real-time defensive response with a very low false-positive rate. This technique allows an application to detect and neutralize a threat before the attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability. The approach is especially suited to soft-<br>ware applications with high information assurance requirements such as in the defense, critical national infrastructure, and financial service sectors to protect against cyber espionage, fraud, business logic abuse, tampering, and theft. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has developed a methodology, documentation, code and pilot demonstration which can be freely used to apply the concepts; this project is called AppSensor.</blockquote>

This is not a temporary suspension, it is a complete removal from our trusted root program. Complete revocation of trust is a decision we treat with careful consideration, and employ as a last resort.</p>
<p>Three central issues informed our decision:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Failure to notify.</strong> DigiNotar detected and revoked some of the fraudulent certificates 6 weeks ago without notifying Mozilla. This is particularly troubling since some of the certificates were issued for our own addons.mozilla.org domain.</p>
<p>2) <strong>The scope of the breach remains unknown.</strong> While we were initially informed by Google that a fraudulent *.google.com certificate had been issued, DigiNotar eventually confirmed that more than 200 certificates had been issued against more than 20 different domains. We now know that the attackers also issued certificates from another of DigiNotar’s intermediate certificates without proper logging. It is therefore impossible for us to know how many fraudulent certificates exist, or which sites are targeted.</p>
<p>3) <strong>The attack is not theoretical.</strong> We have received multiple reports of these certificates being used in the wild.</p>
<p>Mozilla has a strong history of working with CAs to address shared technical challenges, as well as responding to and containing breaches when they do arise. In an incident earlier this year we worked with Comodo to <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/03/25/comodo-certificate-issue-follow-up/\">block a set of mis-issued certificates</a> that were detected, contained, and reported to us immediately. In DigiNotar’s case, by contrast, we have no confidence that the problem had been contained. Furthermore, their failure to notify leaves us deeply concerned about our ability to protect our users from future breaches.</p>
<h2>Staat der Nederlanden Certificates</h2>
<p>DigiNotar issues certificates as part of the Dutch government’s PKIoverheid (PKIgovernment) program. These certificates are issued from a different DigiNotar-controlled intermediate, and chain up to the Dutch government CA (Staat der Nederlanden). The Dutch government’s Computer Emergency Response Team (GovCERT) indicated that these certificates are issued independently of DigiNotar’s other processes and that, in their assessment, these had not been compromised. The Dutch government therefore requested that we exempt these certificates from the removal of trust, which we agreed to do in our initial security update early this week.</p>
<p>The Dutch government has since audited DigiNotar’s performance and rescinded this assessment. We are now removing the exemption for these certificates, meaning that all DigiNotar certificates will be untrusted by Mozilla products. We understand that other browser vendors are making similar changes. We’re also working with our Dutch localizers and the Bits of Freedom group in the Netherlands to contact individual site operators using affected certificates (based on the EFF’s SSL Observatory data).</p>
<p>The integrity of the SSL system cannot be maintained in secrecy. Incidents like this one demonstrate the need for active, immediate and comprehensive communication between CAs and software vendors to keep our collective users safe online.</p>

According to sources close to the investigation, cyber thieves broke into the FIS network and targeted the Sunrise platform’s “open-loop” prepaid debit cards. The balances on these prepaid cards aren’t stored on the cards themselves; rather, the card numbers correspond to records in a central database, where the balances are recorded. Some prepaid cards cannot be used once their balance has been exhausted, but the prepaid cards used in this attack can be replenished by adding funds. Prepaid cards usually limit the amounts that cardholders can withdraw from a cash machine within a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Apparently, the crooks were able to drastically increase or eliminate the withdrawal limits for 22 prepaid cards that they had obtained. The fraudsters then cloned the prepaid cards, and distributed them to co-conspirators in several major cities across Europe, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p><span></span>Sources say the thieves waited until the close of business in the United States on Saturday, March 5, 2011, to launch their attack. Working into Sunday evening, conspirators in Greece, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom used the cloned cards to withdraw cash from dozens of ATMs. Armed with unauthorized access to FIS’s card platform, the crooks were able to reload the cards remotely when the cash withdrawals brought their balances close to zero.</p>
<p>It’s still not clear who was responsible for this attack on FIS. The company declined comment. The FBI would neither confirm nor deny that it is investigating. But the breach is eerily similar to an intricate 2008 attack against <strong>RBS WorldPay</strong>, an Atlanta-based unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland. In that heist, crooks obtained remote access to RBS’s systems and used 44 counterfeit prepaid cards to withdraw more than $9 million from at least 2,100 ATM terminals in 280 cities worldwide. The attack was so sophisticated and alarming that <strong>President Obama</strong> referred to it in <a title=\"Remarks by the President on Securing Our Nation's Cyber Infrastructure\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Securing-Our-Nations-Cyber-Infrastructure/\">a landmark cybersecurity speech.</a></p>
<p>Federal prosecutors <a title=\"NY Times: U.S. Indicts 8 in Worldwide Hacking Ring\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/business/global/12atm.html\">alleged</a> that the 2008 RBS theft was orchestrated by at least eight men from Estonia and Russia — the alleged ringleader was <a title=\"Alleged Ring Leader Extradited in $9.4m RBS WorldPay Heist\" href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/07/rbs_worldpay_extradition/\">extradited</a> to face charges in the United States.</p>
<p>Another key figure in that case was <strong>Viktor Pleschuk</strong> of St. Petersburg, Russia, who monitored the fraudulent ATM withdrawals remotely and in real-time using compromised systems within the payment card network. Pleschuk and Russian accomplice <strong>Eugene Anikin</strong> were arrested and charged in Russia. Prosecutors asked the court for five- and six-year sentences, but those requests were ignored. Pleschuk and Anikin agreed to plead guilty for their roles in the RBS heist in exchange for<a title=\"Hacker 3 Escapes Jail Time in RBS WorldPay ATM Heist\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/hacker-3-escapes-jail-time-in-rbs-worldpay-atm-heist/8096\"> suspended sentences</a> (probation, but no jail time).</p>

Stuff like posting creds over HTTPS isn’t enough, you have to load login forms over HTTPS as well and then you can’t send auth cookies over HTTP because they’ll get sniffed and sessions hijacked and so on and so forth. This is all pretty much security people rhetoric designed to instil fear but without a whole lot of practical basis, right?</p>  <p>That’s an easy assumption to make because it’s hard to observe the risk of insufficient transport layer protection being exploited, at least compared to something like XSS or SQL injection. But it turns out that exploiting unprotected network traffic can actually be extremely simple, you just need to have the right gear. Say hello to my little friend:</p>  <p> </p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wi-Fi Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KA7rofLkRpE/UW538jHFdmI/AAAAAAAAFHE/JPtjHlcp8nw/Untitled-12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"317\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, is a Pineapple. But it’s not just any pineapple, it’s a <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple\">Wi-Fi Pineapple</a> and it has some very impressive party tricks that will help the naysayers understand the real risk of insufficient transport layer protection in web applications which, hopefully, will ultimately help them build safer sites. Let me demonstrate.</p> <a name=\"more\"></a>  <h4>What is this “Pineapple” you speak of?!</h4>  <p>What you’re looking at in the image above is a little device about the size of a cigarette packet running a piece of firmware known as “Jasager” (which over in Germany means “The Yes Man”) based on <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWrt</a> (think of it as Linux for embedded devices). Selling for only $100, it packs Wi-Fi capabilities, a USB jack, a couple of RJ45 Ethernet connectors and implements a kernal mode wireless feature known as “Karma”.</p>  <p>Huh? This is starting to slip into the realm of specialist security gear which is increasingly far away from the everyday issues we deal with as software developers. But it’s <em>exceptionally </em>important because it helps us understand in very graphic terms what the risk of insufficient transport layer protection really is.</p>  <p>The easiest way to think of the Pineapple is as a little device that sits between an unsuspecting user’s PC (or iPhone or other internet connected device) and the resource they’re attempting to access. What this means is that an attacker is able to launch a “Man in the Middle” or MiTM attack by inspecting the data that flow between the victim and any resources they’re accessing on the web. The physical design of the Pineapple means that victims can connect to it via its Wi-Fi adapter and it can connect to a PC with an internet connection via the physical Ethernet adapter. It all looks a bit like this:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Launching an MiTM attack with the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MAg76YqFJ0Q/UW539WEKwXI/AAAAAAAAFHM/E6yZNVJZA7A/WiFi-Pineapple5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"880\" height=\"244\" /></p>  <p>This isn’t the only way of configuring the thing, but being tethered to the attacker’s PC is the easiest way of understanding how it works. The point of all this is that it helps tremendously in understanding the risk of insufficient transport layer protection because ultimately, it’s websites that don’t do a good enough job of this that put the victim at risk. More on that later.</p>  <p>But why on earth would a victim connect to the Pineapple in the first place?! Well firstly, we’ve become alarmingly accustomed to connecting to random wireless access points whilst we’re out and about. When the average person is at the airport waiting for a flight and sees an SSID named “Free Airport Wi-Fi”, what are they going to do? Assume it’s an attacker’s honeypot and stay away from it or believe that it’s free airport Wi-Fi and dive right in? Exactly.</p>  <p>But of course that’s still a very conscious decision on behalf of the user. As it turns out, the Pineapple packs a much more subversive party trick to lure unsuspecting victims in…</p>  <h4>Karma, baby</h4>  <p>The Karma feature is best explained on the Pineapple website:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most wireless devices including laptops, tablets and smartphones have network software that automatically connects to access points they remember. This convenient feature is what gets you online without effort when you turn on your computer at home, the office, coffee shops or airports you frequent. Simply put, when your computer turns on, the wireless radio sends out probe requests. These requests say &quot;Is such-and-such wireless network around?&quot; The WiFi Pineapple Mark IV, powered by Jasager -- German for &quot;The Yes Man&quot; -- replies to these requests to say &quot;Sure, I'm such-and-such wireless access point - let's get you online!&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Wait, what?! So devices just randomly connect to the Pineapple thinking it’s a legitimate AP? Yep, here it is in detail:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Karma saying it is the device's preferred network\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Qzxq_7EMKgo/UW53-B56MfI/AAAAAAAAFHU/NtElaw8-04c/are-you-my-network3.jpg?imgmax=800\" width=\"525\" height=\"159\" /></p>  <p>Simple, huh? The problem is that wireless devices are just too damn trusting. Once they establish a connection with an access point they <em>usually</em> happily reconnect to it at a later date. Of course they need to have the right wireless credentials, but the Pineapple asks for no such thing, it just lets the device straight in whether the access point it <em>thinks </em>it’s connecting to requires them or not.</p>  <p>So that’s how she works, a combination of simply providing an access point that victims connect to on their own free will or being tricked into connecting via Karma. Let’s get it setup and see it all in action.</p>  <h4>Windows tethering</h4>  <p>The easiest way to access the device and get started with configuring everything is to tether it to a PC with two network interfaces. This can be one with a couple of NICs connected to Ethernet or in most cases (and as with the diagram above), a laptop which commonly has a wired NIC <em>and</em> a wireless one.</p>  <p>What we’re going to do is configure the wired Ethernet NIC which we’ll plug the Pineapple into then share the connection on the wireless adapter so that the traffic from the Pineapple can be routed through it, effectively just passing everything through the PC. This is all pretty straight forward and it starts out from the Network Connections settings:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Network Connections in Windows\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MrWEcS1Szes/UW53-v7pSLI/AAAAAAAAFHc/V9l3ORe0txw/image31.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"580\" height=\"274\" /></p>  <p>Just one little note before proceeding: I’m going to obfuscate any SSIDs or MAC addresses used in this post with a grey box simply because they explicitly tie back to my devices (or my neighbours’ devices!) and I’m not real keen on publicly identifying them. Who knows what they might get up to in future…</p>  <p>Jump into the properties of the wireless adapter, and head over to the sharing tab then make sure that “Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection” is checked:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ahGCiZf2N6o/UW53_OAAKMI/AAAAAAAAFHk/P_8ZGT8MoXA/image6111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>That’s that adapter done, now let’s do the wired one. Jump into the properties locate the “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” item:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vWzxt9B5TYU/UW53_x2uSyI/AAAAAAAAFHs/fl24-K_7dkY/image12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>Now grab the properties of that guy and configure a static IP address and subnet mask <em>and</em> set the DNS server as follows:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Static IP address on 172.16.42.42, subnet mask on 255.255.255.0 and DNS on 8.8.8.8\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4jNWAZx8KCo/UW54AdNGHeI/AAAAAAAAFH0/5hiuTx1QbaQ/image9111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"414\" height=\"462\" /></p>  <p>That’s it – job done.</p>  <h4>Accessing the device</h4>  <p>Once tethering is setup and the Pineapple is connected to Ethernet via its PoE LAN port, you should be able to access the Pineapple directly from within your browser via the IP address. You can hit it on <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a> or if running a newer version of the firmware (more on that later), the IP address and port <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a>. All things going well, you’ll be challenged to authenticate:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Authenticating to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RqMYWB-9wT8/UW54BDza6jI/AAAAAAAAFH8/Rt5gJfm-_Vg/image91.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"354\" /></p>  <p>The default credentials are username “root” and password “pineapplesareyummy” after which you should be in:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The Pineapple browser UI\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-f4hrR9qhYN0/UW54BponcHI/AAAAAAAAFIE/x_al0IFp3lQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"498\" /></p>  <p>That’s the first bit done, tethering is working and we can actually access the device, now for a bit of preparation.</p>  <h4>Housekeeping</h4>  <p>Before you start anything, get the firmware up to date. If I’m honest, I’m always scared about updating any firmware on any device because when it goes wrong it’s often a whole world of pain to get yourself back out of trouble again. You’re much better off doing this before you create any dependencies on the device or configure anything. I had a couple of glitches doing mine and it took a few goes, but in theory, you jump over to the “Upgrade” link on the nav, hit “Check for Upgrades” then if required, pull down a package, enter the MD5 hash of it (provided on the upgrade site) and upload the package:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The upgrade interface\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-TKEVg68nZ2A/UW54CbftvRI/AAAAAAAAFIM/_NXzcxzWqtc/image26.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"712\" height=\"513\" /></p>  <p>One little thing you want to remember here: if like me, your GUI was originally accessed via <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a>, keep in mind the newer version of the firmware now puts the GUI behind a port so you want to hit <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a> instead. If, also like me, you try hitting the old address after the install and reboot you’ll keep getting redirected and not much will happen. Then you’ll think you’ve rooted your device (that’s the <a href=\"http://www.koalanet.com.au/australian-slang.html#R\">Australian rooted</a>, not the American one) and start wondering how in the hell you’re ever going to get it back to a known good state and, well, just remember the port change!</p>  <p>Next up, jump into configuration and change the default SSID. The device is configured to show “pineapple” followed by the first and last octets of the Wi-Fi adapter. Change it to something a little more subtle and make it persistent so that when you fire it back up later you’re not reverting to the default:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the SSID\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VAgzd-49TAk/UW54CwthWoI/AAAAAAAAFIU/F5tYyHk3F7o/image23.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"720\" height=\"338\" /></p>  <p>The other thing you want to do on the configuration page is to blacklist the MAC address of the machine you’re going to be orchestrating the Pineapple from <em>and any other devices you don’t want inadvertently connecting to it</em>. This is important if you don’t want to “Pineapple yourself”! Seriously though, it can get very confusing otherwise so this makes good sense.</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Blacklisting a MAC address\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Rp_vhB-NHqI/UW54DRCqcDI/AAAAAAAAFIc/T5ZjW4R7kzM/image17.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"333\" /></p>  <p>Lastly, let’s change that default password, the last thing you want is someone else taking over your Pineapple whilst you’re pretending to be a l33t hax0r! Over to the “Advanced” link then down to the bottom of the page:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the default password\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rA8hdZFTMw4/UW54EZwq6BI/AAAAAAAAFIk/pozoVdObfFg/image61.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"714\" height=\"200\" /></p>  <p>That’s pretty much it for what I felt need to be configured via the UI, let’s go and get a bit low-level and enter the command shell.</p>  <h4>SSH’ing in</h4>  <p>This is where it gets a bit scary for Windows people! Keeping in mind that the Pineapple is ultimately just a little Linux box with some fancy party tricks, there are times when you’ll need to get your hands dirty and enter the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">secure shell</a> world. This is something I do very, very rarely and if memory serves me correctly, it was 1999 when I last regularly used a *nix machine so it was pretty unfamiliar territory for me as well.</p>  <p>Moving on, one of the easiest way of SSH’ing into the device from Windows is to go and grab <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">PuTTY</a>. With this in hand, the only configuration you need is the IP address of the device:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Using PuTTY to SSH into the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mQzJffwbX7g/UW54E-SHBzI/AAAAAAAAFIs/nARezcNK-Ck/image2.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"466\" height=\"449\" /></p>  <p>Open the connection and you’re into the shell:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Into SSH mode on the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-IsVt6YIzU28/UW54FxLZuaI/AAAAAAAAFI0/GSfYRkYatz4/image5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"425\" /></p>  <p>Follow the instructions in the screen above enough times and suddenly the shell doesn’t seem to look so bad!</p>  <p>Keep in mind that this is the OpenWrt distro of Linux and being intended for embedded devices, it’s a pretty lean edition. Don’t expect to find all the features you’d normally see in a full blown desktop edition – many of them are not there so keep that in mind when attempting to use commands that might not be supported.</p>  <p>Once you’re SSH’d in you can go ahead and set the time and time zone correctly. This’ll be well outside your comfort zone if Linux shells are a bit foreign to you (and admittedly I had to look much of this up again), so here’s the whole thing step-by-step:</p>  <ol>   <li>Change the directory to /etc/config: <em>cd /etc/config</em> </li>    <li>Edit the config file in vi: <em>vi config</em> </li>    <li>Navigate down to the “option timezone” line and delete out the existing “UTC” value (unless, of course, you are in the UTC time zone!)</li>    <li>Jump over to the <a href=\"http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system#time.zones\">timezones table on the OpenWrt site</a> and find the appropriate one for your location. </li>    <li>Enter the value from the “TZ string” column into the shell: <em>Hit the “i” key to insert then type away        <br>        <br></em>It should look kinda like this when you’re done:       <br>      <br><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"New timezone\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hKmnGCZ_-Z4/UW54GbRSUHI/AAAAAAAAFI8/pXxnh3S6bJ4/image29.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"143\" />       <br></li>    <li>Save the file: <em>Hit the esc key to stop editing then :w!&lt;enter&gt;</em> </li>    <li>Reboot the Pineapple: <em>reboot &lt;enter&gt;</em> </li> </ol>  <p>A little tip for new players: every time I tried saving the config change I got the following message and nothing actually saved:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Error when saving timezone\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0GOv_BhRu38/UW54Gy29ySI/AAAAAAAAFJE/C-d5958YpJw/image32.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"674\" height=\"114\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, means that there is no available capacity on the device and after wasting considerable time trying to work out why I couldn’t use vi correctly, this become quite clear. Welcome to Linux!</p>  <h4>Working with ext4 format and USB drives</h4>  <p>You’ve got <em>very</em> little space on the device, there’s literally only an 8MB ROM and 32MB of RAM so by the time you load everything into there just required for the device to run, there’ve not much left. It’s <em>certainly</em> not going to be enough to start doing fancy things like storing packet captures which mount up very quickly.</p>  <p>Fortunately it’s all expandable via USB so one of the first things you want to do is grab a spare thumb drive and get it ready for the Pineapple. But there’s a catch – as with many things Linux, this is a slightly different world to good old Windows so you can’t just take your NTFS formatted USB stick and chuck it in, you’ll need to partition it for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4\">ext4</a>.</p>  <p>In theory, this is easy enough to do in the Windows world using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html\">MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>. That sounds just fine – except it’s not and you will only discover this through either banging your head against the wall for hours or reading what comes next. Whilst the aforementioned tool (and I assume others like it running on Windows) <em>seemed</em> like a good idea, I just couldn’t get it to play nice. I’ll spare you the detail as <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/29269-cant-install-infusions-to-usb/\">I’ve captured them all on the Hak5 forum</a>, but in short, the USB would mount and be readable from shell but I could never install Infusions to it (think of them as apps for the Pineapple) which I’ll come to shortly. It turns out that additional partitions were being created and that simply made things not play nice with the Pineapple despite no obvious warnings to that effect.</p>  <p>The solution turns out to be that I needed to create the ext4 partition directly from a Linux machine. If this world is unfamiliar to you, there’s a (relatively) low friction process courtesy of an <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download\">Ubuntu LiveCD</a>. This involves downloading an Ubuntu ISO, burning it to CD (or DVD or bootable USB), running up an in-memory instance of Ubuntu and partitioning the USB from there. I then followed the guidance provided in the very easy to follow page on <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?showtopic=25882\">enabling USB mass storage with swap partition</a> as the swap partition looks like will come in handy later on when you want to start doing some other tricks with the Pineapple. </p>  <p>That sounds like a hassle – running up an entire new operating system just to partition a USB drive – and certainly it was a drama getting to the point of realising that’s what I needed to do, but once you know what needs to be done it’s quite simple. Of course it would have been even simpler if I had a handy Linux machine hanging around somewhere and for many people, that will already be the case.</p>  <p>Once it’s all setup you should see the storage appear under the “USB” menu item like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"USB drive listed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OyXhJQmJRDw/UW54HV-pLZI/AAAAAAAAFJM/holkRYdmC6k/image3.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"90\" /></p>  <p>You’ll also probably want to <em>read </em>from the drive back on your Windows machine at some point (I’ll save some packet captures to it a little later on) and I found <a href=\"http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\">DiskInternals Linux Reader</a> did the job just fine.</p>  <h4>Testing connectivity</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got everything ready to roll, let’s jump into the fun stuff! Back in that first screen grab of the UI, only the “Wireless” and “Cron Jobs” services were running so let’s fire up “Mk4 Karma” and set it to run automatically via the “Autostart” feature so the device just needs to be powered up for everything to kick into action:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Enabling services\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-a67G5cz08ks/UW54Ica8qvI/AAAAAAAAFJU/nLL9fBU7rSQ/image3111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"310\" height=\"203\" /></p>  <p>Now we should be able to jump over to a device such as my iPhone and see some new SSIDs:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"iPhone seeing the &quot;trust me&quot; SSID\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5q0080Y7Gxs/UW54JE1ClwI/AAAAAAAAFJc/KdwNlfVxkFA/Photo-14-04-13-11-18-252.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" /></p>  <p>This is a whole lot more interesting once you understand what’s under the grey box (which again, I’ve deliberately obfuscated), so let me explain what’s happening; each unsecured network is the Pineapple responding to a probe request from the iPhone with the name of the SSID it was previously associated with. The names include that of an old wireless router I replaced some years back, my parents’ network I was connected to interstate just the other day and an airline lounge in a far flung corner of the world. All of the <em>secured</em> networks are legitimate (mine, my neighbour’s, etc.)</p>  <p>We’re also seeing the new SSID of the Pineapple that I set earlier (“trust me”) and I’ve gone ahead and explicitly connected to that for demonstration purposes. This now makes the homepage of the GUI much more interesting:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of probe requests from and MAC addresses from different devices\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ePipCAVZmE8/UW54Juv-1lI/AAAAAAAAFJk/WYnTwU-1HPU/image611.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"713\" height=\"599\" /></p>  <p>What’s particularly interesting is what you <em>can’t</em> see which are all the SSIDs being probed for. These are predominantly APs I’ve connected to in the past and the MAC addresses doing the probing are predominantly my own (the Wi-Fi strength on the Pineapple is not great so I’m seeing mostly nearby devices), but you do see a few unfamiliar ones pop up which are clearly other people’s devices. It does make you wonder what risks might be present from devices leaking SSID names they’ve previously associated to; “Why is my colleague’s Android trying to connect to ‘Mistress Angeliques BDSM Palace’?!”</p>  <p>Anyway, right at the end of the above image you can see the association of my iPhone to the Pineapple which means we can now drill down and get a detailed report of what’s going on:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Details of iPhone connected to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-z7CXdB9cc7k/UW54KBKjGrI/AAAAAAAAFJs/ssKRCsBIclI/image911.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"717\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>This is mostly self-explanatory, the signal strength is kind of interesting as it starts to give you a sense of the distance the victim might be from the device. Of course what will be really interesting is the rx bytes – that’s about one a half MB that the phone has already received through the Pineapple and under normal operating conditions, the user would have absolutely no idea there was an MiTM. Let’s move on to taking a sneaky look at those packets because that’s where things get <em>really</em> interesting!</p>  <h4>Packet capturing</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got all the nuts and bolts in place, let’s start capturing the data. There are a couple of different ways of doing this and probably the simplest is to monitor the traffic moving through the Ethernet adapter on the attacker’s PC. Once we start getting into the realm of traffic monitoring we need to start looking at packets and the best way to do this on a PC by a long shot is to use <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>.</p>  <p>One of the best thing about Wireshark is that it’s free. This is no lightweight tool either, Wireshark is very full featured and is arguably the de facto standard for monitoring, capturing and analysing packets flying around a network. As powerful as Wireshark is, it’s also relatively easy to get started, just fire it up, choose the network interface you want to capture which in this case is the Ethernet adaptor (remember, this is the NIC the Pineapple is connected to) then jump down to the “Capture Options” button:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Starting Wireshark to monitor traffic from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Ne7YzDpxoko/UW54LRVwyaI/AAAAAAAAFJ0/DFFgZL3q0ts/image4111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>The capture options start to give you an idea of the extent of the configurability but we’ll just leave all that as default and start the capture:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark capture options\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1R7_UMzEj1c/UW54L4rCwGI/AAAAAAAAFJ8/7mXK80MYCPo/image7111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"595\" height=\"614\" /></p>  <p>Once started, you should immediately begin to see packets flowing through the NIC:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark packets captured from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Bl64viP2Stg/UW54N9mwJTI/AAAAAAAAFKE/yrDLyCFjSiA/image14.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>Right about here the penny should drop – <em>this is someone else’s traffic!</em> Ok, it’s really my own traffic from my iPhone but of course as we now know, the Pineapple has the ability to easily trick a victim into connecting to it whether deliberately or by default as their device looks for familiar SSIDs. Long story short is that this could just as easily be someone else’s traffic.</p>  <p>I’m not going to delve into exactly what we can do with that traffic right now because I have subsequent posts planned that will demonstrate that, for now though let’s just filter that traffic down to something a bit more familiar – HTTP. You see, the traffic above includes a whole bunch of different protocols which for the purposes of talking about secure website design aren’t going to be of much use. Let’s add in a filter of “http” and load up a popular website with developers:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"HTTP requests to Stack Overflow being captured\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GSblfy9jCsQ/UW54PygDQPI/AAAAAAAAFKM/eplvQ037mnM/image211.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"621\" /></p>  <p>As I’ve written before, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/is-stack-overflow-secure-kind-of.html\">Stack Overflow serves everything outside the logon over HTTP</a> so it’s easy to monitor that traffic (including the authentication cookie). Once the traffic is captured, you can either save it as a PCAP file for later analysis or right click and follow the TCP stream which then gets you into the entire request and response (including the headers with those valuable auth cookies):</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Following the TCP stream of the request and response\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-UZURZFz9TJc/UW54QscUzZI/AAAAAAAAFKU/rVXZQMurshc/image241.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>I’ll stop there because that’s enough to demonstrate that everything is working as expected. Just to illustrate the power of the Pineapple, as I was writing this piece and watching the Wireshark traffic, a whole bunch of packets started appearing <em>that weren’t mine</em>:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"My wife's MacBook Air connecting to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-MoH38Mcz4KA/UW54RaXPubI/AAAAAAAAFKc/0UvZcHcG5nk/image171.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"160\" /></p>  <p>Turns out that my wife had wondered into range with her MacBook Air and it had automatically associated to the SSID “Apple Demo” which I can only assume is the access point the Apple store connected her to when walking her through the shiny new machine she recently bought. So there you go – right out of the box a brand new machine is already falling victim to the Pineapple without even trying.</p>  <h4>Infusions and unattended packet capturing with tcpdump</h4>  <p>This is the last configuration I want to touch on simply because it covers couple of important points: Infusions and using the USB drive we setup earlier. With these concepts understood I actually feel reasonably well-equipped to use the thing so they’re worth capturing here.</p>  <p>The physical capabilities of the Pineapple should be pretty clear by now but what might not be quite as clear to the uninitiated is what can now be achieved with clever software. I’ll write a lot more about these capabilities in the future but for now I want to just take a quick look at the concept of <a href=\"http://wifipineapple.com/index.php?infusions\">Infusions</a>.</p>  <p>Think of Infusions as apps and the Pineapple Bar as an app store for the Pineapple only with a couple of dozen apps that are all free. The Infusions cover a variety of different domains from informational to potentially malicious so there’s a good range of use cases in there. It’s accessible via the Pineapple from the “Pineapple Bar” link in the nav and it gives you some options like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of Infusions\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-eIMW9VFasvA/UW54SPQA8qI/AAAAAAAAFKk/1gvCCWC7gZk/image6111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"743\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>As you can see, I’ve already installed the “status” Infusion and by way of example, here’s the sort of info you get from it:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The status Infusion\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-srCGdSOFli8/UW54ShItYdI/AAAAAAAAFKs/-L_Dp0JraFY/image%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"552\" height=\"899\" /></p>  <p>This can be pretty handy info in GUI format, there are also some neat real time graphs for things like CPU utilisation and bandwidth:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-24EGoXWguCE/UW54TAa4iKI/AAAAAAAAFK0/AYw5xOzSa7E/image9.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"602\" height=\"378\" /></p>  <p>The really interesting one, however, is <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">tcpdump</a>. Now tcpdump is not an Infusion in and of itself, it’s an existing project which has been turned into an Infusion so that’s easily installable on the Pineapple and can then be managed from the GUI. What tcpdump offers is the ability to effectively do what we just did with Wireshark in terms of packet capturing but to do so locally within the device itself. What this means is that you can have the Pineapple independently capture traffic without needing to run Wireshark on a PC. In fact if you establish a connection from the Pineapple directly to the web (and there are several ways to do this), you don’t need a PC at all. Imagine just that little cigarette pack sized Pineapple sitting there on its own with its own power source and internet connection and any victims within Wi-Fi shot of it automatically connecting and having their packets captured. <em>That’s</em> powerful stuff.</p>  <p>Now that we have a <em>correctly partitioned</em> USB drive, Infusions can be installed directly to there:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-p2d5NmTXU4I/UW54T9tY7rI/AAAAAAAAFK8/yTU-9FnizB0/image9111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"586\" height=\"122\" /></p>  <p>Incidentally, it’s that highlighted “USB Storage” link that I never saw when creating the ext4 partition in Windows.</p>  <p>The thing with packet captures is that there can be a lot of them and they can chew up space <em>really</em> quickly depending on how liberal you are with the data you want to save. You can configure tcpdump to filter out a lot of the “noise” packets and restrict it to, say, only HTTP traffic or even just only to HTTP requests using the POST verb. For now though we’ll just run it up with the defaults to capture all the traffic running through the wired LAN port:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Capturing TCP traffic using tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-77Z5GhmZBm8/UW54UqTp_kI/AAAAAAAAFLE/x3ZCtGyPjX0/image4.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"543\" /></p>  <p>You can now sit back and let the traffic flow whilst the Pineapple captures everything anyone connected to it sends across the wire (or air, as it may be). With the iPhone connected, I browsed over to a site I know doesn’t properly protect user credentials and attempted to logon. Once done you can hit “Stop” and you’ll see a summary of the captured data:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Captured packets from tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UxrDrz2Qzco/UW54VGgpXcI/AAAAAAAAFLM/sy1YgW14H4w/image%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"699\" height=\"130\" /></p>  <p>No we can jump over to the “History” tab and download the PCAP file:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Viewing the tcpdump history\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-klhWubPTmv8/UW54Viwfy-I/AAAAAAAAFLU/FVTKcrnkZ5s/image%25255B6%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"394\" height=\"121\" /></p>  <p>That PCAP file is just the same as what we captured in Wireshark earlier on and you can now load it back up into Wireshark and analyse it in just the same way as you would the packets it captured directly. Alternatively, you can pull the USB out, chuck it into the PC and read it with a tool like DiskInternals which I mentioned earlier. Here’s what we can now see from my brief visit to the site</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Login credentials sent in unprotected GET request\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ITtGPmF44CI/UW54W8TMdNI/AAAAAAAAFLc/Uh1B4iBHQZo/image%25255B9%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>This site is <em>particularly</em> bad because the credentials just go into a GET request but of course the real story in the context of the Pineapple is that the whole thing is sent in the clear so it’s now easy to see everything sent by the victim and returned by the server. Keep in mind that this was all captured directly on the Pineapple (or at least on the USB) so the whole thing is now pretty well self-contained. That’s a good place to end the traffic capture for today, there’ll be <em>much</em> more in the future though…</p>  <h4>Other miscellaneous info</h4>  <p>For those of you thinking of getting yourself into a Pineapple (and I know there are a few based on Twitter chats alone), there are a couple of pre-purchase things worth pointing out. Firstly, I went el-cheapo and only got the device itself without any accessories. This means you get an AC adaptor for power and that’s it so it’s definitely <em>not </em>mobile.</p>  <p>Being able to take the Pineapple out in the wild definitely presents all sorts of opportunities not available while it’s plugged in to the mains so the <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/accessory/products/usb-battery-pack-3200mah\">USB battery pack</a> is a must. As the name suggests, this also gives you the ability to power the device directly from USB so you can just plug it into your laptop if the juice in the battery runs out.</p>  <p>The other thing is that the Wi-Fi strength is pretty ordinary. By way of example, here’s how <a href=\"http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/\">inSSIDer</a> sees the Pineapple (in yellow, of course) versus my usual access point in blue from only about a foot away:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-PeooN0RcNQo/UW542mkm8rI/AAAAAAAAFLk/vtbIKh5vBsE/image72.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>However, mover into the next room and the Pineapple just about drops off altogether:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-jaf-526cP-Y/UW543Cy7n2I/AAAAAAAAFLs/e4AQkrZDXro/image1011.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>There are <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/antennas\">a few different antenna options</a> so if your intended use doesn’t involve connecting to a target within a very, very close distance then this would be worth a look. Other than that though, the only other thing that <em>might</em> be useful is a handy case and given HakShop has <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple-holiday-bundle\">a Pineapple with battery and a case going for $115</a> at the time of writing, that’s probably your best bet.</p>  <p>The other thing that some people might find interesting is that a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/killuminati2012/wifipineapple/wiki\">the code running on the Pineapple is up on GitHub</a>. This is apparently the www folder of the device so it’s not the firmware itself, but it is a bunch of the PHP files and scripts which is kind of interesting to have a browse through.</p>  <h4>Responsible use</h4>  <p>I bought the Pineapple for the sole purpose of helping developers better understand the risks of insufficient transport layer security. You’re going to see me writing a lot more about the risks of loading logon forms over HTTP, embedding HTTPS login forms in HTTP pages, mixed mode HTTP / HTTPS and other similar risks. The Pineapple will help me move that discussion from a theoretical “An attacker might do this or could do that” to a very practical “Here, let me show you exactly why that pattern is risky”. Demonstrations of this kind are very powerful and they’re often the only way of getting the message through.</p>  <p>However, there is very clearly scope for misuse and abuse of unsuspecting victims. That incident I mentioned earlier where my wife walked into the room and suddenly I was watching <em>her</em> network traffic is a perfect example of how easy it is to do potentially evil things, sometimes without even trying. For those reading this and considering how they might use it, there are some great use cases for penetration testing or demoing (in)secure web app design but there is also some very, very thin ice out there. Caveat emptor.</p>  <h4>What next for the Pineapple?</h4>  <p>The great thing about the Pineapple is that it makes it dead easy to demonstrate a whole bunch of concepts that I often write about but haven’t always shown in execution. For example, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html\">why it’s not ok to load login forms over HTTP even if they post to HTTPS</a>. Another one that has come up a few times (including in <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">the Top CashBack post</a>) is not embedding a login form that <em>is</em> loaded over HTTPS within an iframe in an HTTP page. There’s a whole heap of things that will be easily demonstrated within a controlled environment.</p>  <p>Then there’s the uncontrolled environment – the public. There’s a lot of grey area there about what can be done for the purposes of research and education without crossing the line into outright eavesdropping and getting on the wrong side of people. I do have some thoughts on it, but I’ll hold onto those for the moment…</p>  <p>Regardless, I’ll start producing some video material to demonstrate the ease with which this thing does its work because it’s immensely impressive to see in real time – at least <em>I</em> was impressed!

This is all pretty much security people rhetoric designed to instil fear but without a whole lot of practical basis, right?</p>  <p>That’s an easy assumption to make because it’s hard to observe the risk of insufficient transport layer protection being exploited, at least compared to something like XSS or SQL injection. But it turns out that exploiting unprotected network traffic can actually be extremely simple, you just need to have the right gear. Say hello to my little friend:</p>  <p> </p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wi-Fi Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KA7rofLkRpE/UW538jHFdmI/AAAAAAAAFHE/JPtjHlcp8nw/Untitled-12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"317\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, is a Pineapple. But it’s not just any pineapple, it’s a <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple\">Wi-Fi Pineapple</a> and it has some very impressive party tricks that will help the naysayers understand the real risk of insufficient transport layer protection in web applications which, hopefully, will ultimately help them build safer sites. Let me demonstrate.</p> <a name=\"more\"></a>  <h4>What is this “Pineapple” you speak of?!</h4>  <p>What you’re looking at in the image above is a little device about the size of a cigarette packet running a piece of firmware known as “Jasager” (which over in Germany means “The Yes Man”) based on <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWrt</a> (think of it as Linux for embedded devices). Selling for only $100, it packs Wi-Fi capabilities, a USB jack, a couple of RJ45 Ethernet connectors and implements a kernal mode wireless feature known as “Karma”.</p>  <p>Huh? This is starting to slip into the realm of specialist security gear which is increasingly far away from the everyday issues we deal with as software developers. But it’s <em>exceptionally </em>important because it helps us understand in very graphic terms what the risk of insufficient transport layer protection really is.</p>  <p>The easiest way to think of the Pineapple is as a little device that sits between an unsuspecting user’s PC (or iPhone or other internet connected device) and the resource they’re attempting to access. What this means is that an attacker is able to launch a “Man in the Middle” or MiTM attack by inspecting the data that flow between the victim and any resources they’re accessing on the web. The physical design of the Pineapple means that victims can connect to it via its Wi-Fi adapter and it can connect to a PC with an internet connection via the physical Ethernet adapter. It all looks a bit like this:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Launching an MiTM attack with the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MAg76YqFJ0Q/UW539WEKwXI/AAAAAAAAFHM/E6yZNVJZA7A/WiFi-Pineapple5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"880\" height=\"244\" /></p>  <p>This isn’t the only way of configuring the thing, but being tethered to the attacker’s PC is the easiest way of understanding how it works. The point of all this is that it helps tremendously in understanding the risk of insufficient transport layer protection because ultimately, it’s websites that don’t do a good enough job of this that put the victim at risk. More on that later.</p>  <p>But why on earth would a victim connect to the Pineapple in the first place?! Well firstly, we’ve become alarmingly accustomed to connecting to random wireless access points whilst we’re out and about. When the average person is at the airport waiting for a flight and sees an SSID named “Free Airport Wi-Fi”, what are they going to do? Assume it’s an attacker’s honeypot and stay away from it or believe that it’s free airport Wi-Fi and dive right in? Exactly.</p>  <p>But of course that’s still a very conscious decision on behalf of the user. As it turns out, the Pineapple packs a much more subversive party trick to lure unsuspecting victims in…</p>  <h4>Karma, baby</h4>  <p>The Karma feature is best explained on the Pineapple website:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most wireless devices including laptops, tablets and smartphones have network software that automatically connects to access points they remember. This convenient feature is what gets you online without effort when you turn on your computer at home, the office, coffee shops or airports you frequent. Simply put, when your computer turns on, the wireless radio sends out probe requests. These requests say &quot;Is such-and-such wireless network around?&quot; The WiFi Pineapple Mark IV, powered by Jasager -- German for &quot;The Yes Man&quot; -- replies to these requests to say &quot;Sure, I&#39;m such-and-such wireless access point - let&#39;s get you online!&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>Wait, what?! So devices just randomly connect to the Pineapple thinking it’s a legitimate AP? Yep, here it is in detail:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Karma saying it is the device's preferred network\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Qzxq_7EMKgo/UW53-B56MfI/AAAAAAAAFHU/NtElaw8-04c/are-you-my-network3.jpg?imgmax=800\" width=\"525\" height=\"159\" /></p>  <p>Simple, huh? The problem is that wireless devices are just too damn trusting. Once they establish a connection with an access point they <em>usually</em> happily reconnect to it at a later date. Of course they need to have the right wireless credentials, but the Pineapple asks for no such thing, it just lets the device straight in whether the access point it <em>thinks </em>it’s connecting to requires them or not.</p>  <p>So that’s how she works, a combination of simply providing an access point that victims connect to on their own free will or being tricked into connecting via Karma. Let’s get it setup and see it all in action.</p>  <h4>Windows tethering</h4>  <p>The easiest way to access the device and get started with configuring everything is to tether it to a PC with two network interfaces. This can be one with a couple of NICs connected to Ethernet or in most cases (and as with the diagram above), a laptop which commonly has a wired NIC <em>and</em> a wireless one.</p>  <p>What we’re going to do is configure the wired Ethernet NIC which we’ll plug the Pineapple into then share the connection on the wireless adapter so that the traffic from the Pineapple can be routed through it, effectively just passing everything through the PC. This is all pretty straight forward and it starts out from the Network Connections settings:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Network Connections in Windows\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MrWEcS1Szes/UW53-v7pSLI/AAAAAAAAFHc/V9l3ORe0txw/image31.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"580\" height=\"274\" /></p>  <p>Just one little note before proceeding: I’m going to obfuscate any SSIDs or MAC addresses used in this post with a grey box simply because they explicitly tie back to my devices (or my neighbours’ devices!) and I’m not real keen on publicly identifying them. Who knows what they might get up to in future…</p>  <p>Jump into the properties of the wireless adapter, and head over to the sharing tab then make sure that “Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection” is checked:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ahGCiZf2N6o/UW53_OAAKMI/AAAAAAAAFHk/P_8ZGT8MoXA/image6111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>That’s that adapter done, now let’s do the wired one. Jump into the properties locate the “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” item:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vWzxt9B5TYU/UW53_x2uSyI/AAAAAAAAFHs/fl24-K_7dkY/image12.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"377\" height=\"475\" /></p>  <p>Now grab the properties of that guy and configure a static IP address and subnet mask <em>and</em> set the DNS server as follows:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Static IP address on 172.16.42.42, subnet mask on 255.255.255.0 and DNS on 8.8.8.8\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4jNWAZx8KCo/UW54AdNGHeI/AAAAAAAAFH0/5hiuTx1QbaQ/image9111%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"414\" height=\"462\" /></p>  <p>That’s it – job done.</p>  <h4>Accessing the device</h4>  <p>Once tethering is setup and the Pineapple is connected to Ethernet via its PoE LAN port, you should be able to access the Pineapple directly from within your browser via the IP address. You can hit it on <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a> or if running a newer version of the firmware (more on that later), the IP address and port <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a>. All things going well, you’ll be challenged to authenticate:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Authenticating to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RqMYWB-9wT8/UW54BDza6jI/AAAAAAAAFH8/Rt5gJfm-_Vg/image91.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"439\" height=\"354\" /></p>  <p>The default credentials are username “root” and password “pineapplesareyummy” after which you should be in:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The Pineapple browser UI\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-f4hrR9qhYN0/UW54BponcHI/AAAAAAAAFIE/x_al0IFp3lQ/image18.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"498\" /></p>  <p>That’s the first bit done, tethering is working and we can actually access the device, now for a bit of preparation.</p>  <h4>Housekeeping</h4>  <p>Before you start anything, get the firmware up to date. If I’m honest, I’m always scared about updating any firmware on any device because when it goes wrong it’s often a whole world of pain to get yourself back out of trouble again. You’re much better off doing this before you create any dependencies on the device or configure anything. I had a couple of glitches doing mine and it took a few goes, but in theory, you jump over to the “Upgrade” link on the nav, hit “Check for Upgrades” then if required, pull down a package, enter the MD5 hash of it (provided on the upgrade site) and upload the package:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The upgrade interface\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-TKEVg68nZ2A/UW54CbftvRI/AAAAAAAAFIM/_NXzcxzWqtc/image26.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"712\" height=\"513\" /></p>  <p>One little thing you want to remember here: if like me, your GUI was originally accessed via <a title=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471/\" href=\"http://172.16.42.1/pineapple\">172.16.42.1/pineapple</a>, keep in mind the newer version of the firmware now puts the GUI behind a port so you want to hit <a href=\"http://172.16.42.1:1471\">172.16.42.1:1471</a> instead. If, also like me, you try hitting the old address after the install and reboot you’ll keep getting redirected and not much will happen. Then you’ll think you’ve rooted your device (that’s the <a href=\"http://www.koalanet.com.au/australian-slang.html#R\">Australian rooted</a>, not the American one) and start wondering how in the hell you’re ever going to get it back to a known good state and, well, just remember the port change!</p>  <p>Next up, jump into configuration and change the default SSID. The device is configured to show “pineapple” followed by the first and last octets of the Wi-Fi adapter. Change it to something a little more subtle and make it persistent so that when you fire it back up later you’re not reverting to the default:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the SSID\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VAgzd-49TAk/UW54CwthWoI/AAAAAAAAFIU/F5tYyHk3F7o/image23.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"720\" height=\"338\" /></p>  <p>The other thing you want to do on the configuration page is to blacklist the MAC address of the machine you’re going to be orchestrating the Pineapple from <em>and any other devices you don’t want inadvertently connecting to it</em>. This is important if you don’t want to “Pineapple yourself”! Seriously though, it can get very confusing otherwise so this makes good sense.</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Blacklisting a MAC address\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Rp_vhB-NHqI/UW54DRCqcDI/AAAAAAAAFIc/T5ZjW4R7kzM/image17.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"333\" /></p>  <p>Lastly, let’s change that default password, the last thing you want is someone else taking over your Pineapple whilst you’re pretending to be a l33t hax0r! Over to the “Advanced” link then down to the bottom of the page:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Changing the default password\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-rA8hdZFTMw4/UW54EZwq6BI/AAAAAAAAFIk/pozoVdObfFg/image61.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"714\" height=\"200\" /></p>  <p>That’s pretty much it for what I felt need to be configured via the UI, let’s go and get a bit low-level and enter the command shell.</p>  <h4>SSH’ing in</h4>  <p>This is where it gets a bit scary for Windows people! Keeping in mind that the Pineapple is ultimately just a little Linux box with some fancy party tricks, there are times when you’ll need to get your hands dirty and enter the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">secure shell</a> world. This is something I do very, very rarely and if memory serves me correctly, it was 1999 when I last regularly used a *nix machine so it was pretty unfamiliar territory for me as well.</p>  <p>Moving on, one of the easiest way of SSH’ing into the device from Windows is to go and grab <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">PuTTY</a>. With this in hand, the only configuration you need is the IP address of the device:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Using PuTTY to SSH into the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mQzJffwbX7g/UW54E-SHBzI/AAAAAAAAFIs/nARezcNK-Ck/image2.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"466\" height=\"449\" /></p>  <p>Open the connection and you’re into the shell:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Into SSH mode on the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-IsVt6YIzU28/UW54FxLZuaI/AAAAAAAAFI0/GSfYRkYatz4/image5.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"425\" /></p>  <p>Follow the instructions in the screen above enough times and suddenly the shell doesn’t seem to look so bad!</p>  <p>Keep in mind that this is the OpenWrt distro of Linux and being intended for embedded devices, it’s a pretty lean edition. Don’t expect to find all the features you’d normally see in a full blown desktop edition – many of them are not there so keep that in mind when attempting to use commands that might not be supported.</p>  <p>Once you’re SSH’d in you can go ahead and set the time and time zone correctly. This’ll be well outside your comfort zone if Linux shells are a bit foreign to you (and admittedly I had to look much of this up again), so here’s the whole thing step-by-step:</p>  <ol>   <li>Change the directory to /etc/config: <em>cd /etc/config</em> </li>    <li>Edit the config file in vi: <em>vi config</em> </li>    <li>Navigate down to the “option timezone” line and delete out the existing “UTC” value (unless, of course, you are in the UTC time zone!)</li>    <li>Jump over to the <a href=\"http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system#time.zones\">timezones table on the OpenWrt site</a> and find the appropriate one for your location. </li>    <li>Enter the value from the “TZ string” column into the shell: <em>Hit the “i” key to insert then type away        <br>        <br></em>It should look kinda like this when you’re done:       <br>      <br><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"New timezone\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-hKmnGCZ_-Z4/UW54GbRSUHI/AAAAAAAAFI8/pXxnh3S6bJ4/image29.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"675\" height=\"143\" />       <br></li>    <li>Save the file: <em>Hit the esc key to stop editing then :w!&lt;enter&gt;</em> </li>    <li>Reboot the Pineapple: <em>reboot &lt;enter&gt;</em> </li> </ol>  <p>A little tip for new players: every time I tried saving the config change I got the following message and nothing actually saved:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Error when saving timezone\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0GOv_BhRu38/UW54Gy29ySI/AAAAAAAAFJE/C-d5958YpJw/image32.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"674\" height=\"114\" /></p>  <p>This, quite clearly, means that there is no available capacity on the device and after wasting considerable time trying to work out why I couldn’t use vi correctly, this become quite clear. Welcome to Linux!</p>  <h4>Working with ext4 format and USB drives</h4>  <p>You’ve got <em>very</em> little space on the device, there’s literally only an 8MB ROM and 32MB of RAM so by the time you load everything into there just required for the device to run, there’ve not much left. It’s <em>certainly</em> not going to be enough to start doing fancy things like storing packet captures which mount up very quickly.</p>  <p>Fortunately it’s all expandable via USB so one of the first things you want to do is grab a spare thumb drive and get it ready for the Pineapple. But there’s a catch – as with many things Linux, this is a slightly different world to good old Windows so you can’t just take your NTFS formatted USB stick and chuck it in, you’ll need to partition it for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4\">ext4</a>.</p>  <p>In theory, this is easy enough to do in the Windows world using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html\">MiniTool Partition Wizard</a>. That sounds just fine – except it’s not and you will only discover this through either banging your head against the wall for hours or reading what comes next. Whilst the aforementioned tool (and I assume others like it running on Windows) <em>seemed</em> like a good idea, I just couldn’t get it to play nice. I’ll spare you the detail as <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/29269-cant-install-infusions-to-usb/\">I’ve captured them all on the Hak5 forum</a>, but in short, the USB would mount and be readable from shell but I could never install Infusions to it (think of them as apps for the Pineapple) which I’ll come to shortly. It turns out that additional partitions were being created and that simply made things not play nice with the Pineapple despite no obvious warnings to that effect.</p>  <p>The solution turns out to be that I needed to create the ext4 partition directly from a Linux machine. If this world is unfamiliar to you, there’s a (relatively) low friction process courtesy of an <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download\">Ubuntu LiveCD</a>. This involves downloading an Ubuntu ISO, burning it to CD (or DVD or bootable USB), running up an in-memory instance of Ubuntu and partitioning the USB from there. I then followed the guidance provided in the very easy to follow page on <a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?showtopic=25882\">enabling USB mass storage with swap partition</a> as the swap partition looks like will come in handy later on when you want to start doing some other tricks with the Pineapple. </p>  <p>That sounds like a hassle – running up an entire new operating system just to partition a USB drive – and certainly it was a drama getting to the point of realising that’s what I needed to do, but once you know what needs to be done it’s quite simple. Of course it would have been even simpler if I had a handy Linux machine hanging around somewhere and for many people, that will already be the case.</p>  <p>Once it’s all setup you should see the storage appear under the “USB” menu item like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"USB drive listed\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-OyXhJQmJRDw/UW54HV-pLZI/AAAAAAAAFJM/holkRYdmC6k/image3.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"716\" height=\"90\" /></p>  <p>You’ll also probably want to <em>read </em>from the drive back on your Windows machine at some point (I’ll save some packet captures to it a little later on) and I found <a href=\"http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\">DiskInternals Linux Reader</a> did the job just fine.</p>  <h4>Testing connectivity</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got everything ready to roll, let’s jump into the fun stuff! Back in that first screen grab of the UI, only the “Wireless” and “Cron Jobs” services were running so let’s fire up “Mk4 Karma” and set it to run automatically via the “Autostart” feature so the device just needs to be powered up for everything to kick into action:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Enabling services\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-a67G5cz08ks/UW54Ica8qvI/AAAAAAAAFJU/nLL9fBU7rSQ/image3111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"310\" height=\"203\" /></p>  <p>Now we should be able to jump over to a device such as my iPhone and see some new SSIDs:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"iPhone seeing the &quot;trust me&quot; SSID\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-5q0080Y7Gxs/UW54JE1ClwI/AAAAAAAAFJc/KdwNlfVxkFA/Photo-14-04-13-11-18-252.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" /></p>  <p>This is a whole lot more interesting once you understand what’s under the grey box (which again, I’ve deliberately obfuscated), so let me explain what’s happening; each unsecured network is the Pineapple responding to a probe request from the iPhone with the name of the SSID it was previously associated with. The names include that of an old wireless router I replaced some years back, my parents’ network I was connected to interstate just the other day and an airline lounge in a far flung corner of the world. All of the <em>secured</em> networks are legitimate (mine, my neighbour’s, etc.)</p>  <p>We’re also seeing the new SSID of the Pineapple that I set earlier (“trust me”) and I’ve gone ahead and explicitly connected to that for demonstration purposes. This now makes the homepage of the GUI much more interesting:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of probe requests from and MAC addresses from different devices\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ePipCAVZmE8/UW54Juv-1lI/AAAAAAAAFJk/WYnTwU-1HPU/image611.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"713\" height=\"599\" /></p>  <p>What’s particularly interesting is what you <em>can’t</em> see which are all the SSIDs being probed for. These are predominantly APs I’ve connected to in the past and the MAC addresses doing the probing are predominantly my own (the Wi-Fi strength on the Pineapple is not great so I’m seeing mostly nearby devices), but you do see a few unfamiliar ones pop up which are clearly other people’s devices. It does make you wonder what risks might be present from devices leaking SSID names they’ve previously associated to; “Why is my colleague’s Android trying to connect to ‘Mistress Angeliques BDSM Palace’?!”</p>  <p>Anyway, right at the end of the above image you can see the association of my iPhone to the Pineapple which means we can now drill down and get a detailed report of what’s going on:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Details of iPhone connected to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-z7CXdB9cc7k/UW54KBKjGrI/AAAAAAAAFJs/ssKRCsBIclI/image911.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"717\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>This is mostly self-explanatory, the signal strength is kind of interesting as it starts to give you a sense of the distance the victim might be from the device. Of course what will be really interesting is the rx bytes – that’s about one a half MB that the phone has already received through the Pineapple and under normal operating conditions, the user would have absolutely no idea there was an MiTM. Let’s move on to taking a sneaky look at those packets because that’s where things get <em>really</em> interesting!</p>  <h4>Packet capturing</h4>  <p>Now that we’ve got all the nuts and bolts in place, let’s start capturing the data. There are a couple of different ways of doing this and probably the simplest is to monitor the traffic moving through the Ethernet adapter on the attacker’s PC. Once we start getting into the realm of traffic monitoring we need to start looking at packets and the best way to do this on a PC by a long shot is to use <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\">Wireshark</a>.</p>  <p>One of the best thing about Wireshark is that it’s free. This is no lightweight tool either, Wireshark is very full featured and is arguably the de facto standard for monitoring, capturing and analysing packets flying around a network. As powerful as Wireshark is, it’s also relatively easy to get started, just fire it up, choose the network interface you want to capture which in this case is the Ethernet adaptor (remember, this is the NIC the Pineapple is connected to) then jump down to the “Capture Options” button:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Starting Wireshark to monitor traffic from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Ne7YzDpxoko/UW54LRVwyaI/AAAAAAAAFJ0/DFFgZL3q0ts/image4111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>The capture options start to give you an idea of the extent of the configurability but we’ll just leave all that as default and start the capture:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark capture options\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1R7_UMzEj1c/UW54L4rCwGI/AAAAAAAAFJ8/7mXK80MYCPo/image7111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"595\" height=\"614\" /></p>  <p>Once started, you should immediately begin to see packets flowing through the NIC:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wireshark packets captured from the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Bl64viP2Stg/UW54N9mwJTI/AAAAAAAAFKE/yrDLyCFjSiA/image14.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"620\" /></p>  <p>Right about here the penny should drop – <em>this is someone else’s traffic!</em> Ok, it’s really my own traffic from my iPhone but of course as we now know, the Pineapple has the ability to easily trick a victim into connecting to it whether deliberately or by default as their device looks for familiar SSIDs. Long story short is that this could just as easily be someone else’s traffic.</p>  <p>I’m not going to delve into exactly what we can do with that traffic right now because I have subsequent posts planned that will demonstrate that, for now though let’s just filter that traffic down to something a bit more familiar – HTTP. You see, the traffic above includes a whole bunch of different protocols which for the purposes of talking about secure website design aren’t going to be of much use. Let’s add in a filter of “http” and load up a popular website with developers:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"HTTP requests to Stack Overflow being captured\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-GSblfy9jCsQ/UW54PygDQPI/AAAAAAAAFKM/eplvQ037mnM/image211.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"621\" /></p>  <p>As I’ve written before, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/is-stack-overflow-secure-kind-of.html\">Stack Overflow serves everything outside the logon over HTTP</a> so it’s easy to monitor that traffic (including the authentication cookie). Once the traffic is captured, you can either save it as a PCAP file for later analysis or right click and follow the TCP stream which then gets you into the entire request and response (including the headers with those valuable auth cookies):</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Following the TCP stream of the request and response\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-UZURZFz9TJc/UW54QscUzZI/AAAAAAAAFKU/rVXZQMurshc/image241.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>I’ll stop there because that’s enough to demonstrate that everything is working as expected. Just to illustrate the power of the Pineapple, as I was writing this piece and watching the Wireshark traffic, a whole bunch of packets started appearing <em>that weren’t mine</em>:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"My wife's MacBook Air connecting to the Pineapple\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-MoH38Mcz4KA/UW54RaXPubI/AAAAAAAAFKc/0UvZcHcG5nk/image171.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"160\" /></p>  <p>Turns out that my wife had wondered into range with her MacBook Air and it had automatically associated to the SSID “Apple Demo” which I can only assume is the access point the Apple store connected her to when walking her through the shiny new machine she recently bought. So there you go – right out of the box a brand new machine is already falling victim to the Pineapple without even trying.</p>  <h4>Infusions and unattended packet capturing with tcpdump</h4>  <p>This is the last configuration I want to touch on simply because it covers couple of important points: Infusions and using the USB drive we setup earlier. With these concepts understood I actually feel reasonably well-equipped to use the thing so they’re worth capturing here.</p>  <p>The physical capabilities of the Pineapple should be pretty clear by now but what might not be quite as clear to the uninitiated is what can now be achieved with clever software. I’ll write a lot more about these capabilities in the future but for now I want to just take a quick look at the concept of <a href=\"http://wifipineapple.com/index.php?infusions\">Infusions</a>.</p>  <p>Think of Infusions as apps and the Pineapple Bar as an app store for the Pineapple only with a couple of dozen apps that are all free. The Infusions cover a variety of different domains from informational to potentially malicious so there’s a good range of use cases in there. It’s accessible via the Pineapple from the “Pineapple Bar” link in the nav and it gives you some options like so:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"List of Infusions\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-eIMW9VFasvA/UW54SPQA8qI/AAAAAAAAFKk/1gvCCWC7gZk/image6111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"743\" height=\"441\" /></p>  <p>As you can see, I’ve already installed the “status” Infusion and by way of example, here’s the sort of info you get from it:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"The status Infusion\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-srCGdSOFli8/UW54ShItYdI/AAAAAAAAFKs/-L_Dp0JraFY/image%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"552\" height=\"899\" /></p>  <p>This can be pretty handy info in GUI format, there are also some neat real time graphs for things like CPU utilisation and bandwidth:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-24EGoXWguCE/UW54TAa4iKI/AAAAAAAAFK0/AYw5xOzSa7E/image9.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"602\" height=\"378\" /></p>  <p>The really interesting one, however, is <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/\">tcpdump</a>. Now tcpdump is not an Infusion in and of itself, it’s an existing project which has been turned into an Infusion so that’s easily installable on the Pineapple and can then be managed from the GUI. What tcpdump offers is the ability to effectively do what we just did with Wireshark in terms of packet capturing but to do so locally within the device itself. What this means is that you can have the Pineapple independently capture traffic without needing to run Wireshark on a PC. In fact if you establish a connection from the Pineapple directly to the web (and there are several ways to do this), you don’t need a PC at all. Imagine just that little cigarette pack sized Pineapple sitting there on its own with its own power source and internet connection and any victims within Wi-Fi shot of it automatically connecting and having their packets captured. <em>That’s</em> powerful stuff.</p>  <p>Now that we have a <em>correctly partitioned</em> USB drive, Infusions can be installed directly to there:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-p2d5NmTXU4I/UW54T9tY7rI/AAAAAAAAFK8/yTU-9FnizB0/image9111.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"586\" height=\"122\" /></p>  <p>Incidentally, it’s that highlighted “USB Storage” link that I never saw when creating the ext4 partition in Windows.</p>  <p>The thing with packet captures is that there can be a lot of them and they can chew up space <em>really</em> quickly depending on how liberal you are with the data you want to save. You can configure tcpdump to filter out a lot of the “noise” packets and restrict it to, say, only HTTP traffic or even just only to HTTP requests using the POST verb. For now though we’ll just run it up with the defaults to capture all the traffic running through the wired LAN port:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Capturing TCP traffic using tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-77Z5GhmZBm8/UW54UqTp_kI/AAAAAAAAFLE/x3ZCtGyPjX0/image4.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"543\" /></p>  <p>You can now sit back and let the traffic flow whilst the Pineapple captures everything anyone connected to it sends across the wire (or air, as it may be). With the iPhone connected, I browsed over to a site I know doesn’t properly protect user credentials and attempted to logon. Once done you can hit “Stop” and you’ll see a summary of the captured data:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Captured packets from tcpdump\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UxrDrz2Qzco/UW54VGgpXcI/AAAAAAAAFLM/sy1YgW14H4w/image%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"699\" height=\"130\" /></p>  <p>No we can jump over to the “History” tab and download the PCAP file:</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Viewing the tcpdump history\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/-klhWubPTmv8/UW54Viwfy-I/AAAAAAAAFLU/FVTKcrnkZ5s/image%25255B6%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"394\" height=\"121\" /></p>  <p>That PCAP file is just the same as what we captured in Wireshark earlier on and you can now load it back up into Wireshark and analyse it in just the same way as you would the packets it captured directly. Alternatively, you can pull the USB out, chuck it into the PC and read it with a tool like DiskInternals which I mentioned earlier. Here’s what we can now see from my brief visit to the site</p>  <p><img title=\"\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Login credentials sent in unprotected GET request\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ITtGPmF44CI/UW54W8TMdNI/AAAAAAAAFLc/Uh1B4iBHQZo/image%25255B9%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"766\" height=\"589\" /></p>  <p>This site is <em>particularly</em> bad because the credentials just go into a GET request but of course the real story in the context of the Pineapple is that the whole thing is sent in the clear so it’s now easy to see everything sent by the victim and returned by the server. Keep in mind that this was all captured directly on the Pineapple (or at least on the USB) so the whole thing is now pretty well self-contained. That’s a good place to end the traffic capture for today, there’ll be <em>much</em> more in the future though…</p>  <h4>Other miscellaneous info</h4>  <p>For those of you thinking of getting yourself into a Pineapple (and I know there are a few based on Twitter chats alone), there are a couple of pre-purchase things worth pointing out. Firstly, I went el-cheapo and only got the device itself without any accessories. This means you get an AC adaptor for power and that’s it so it’s definitely <em>not </em>mobile.</p>  <p>Being able to take the Pineapple out in the wild definitely presents all sorts of opportunities not available while it’s plugged in to the mains so the <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/accessory/products/usb-battery-pack-3200mah\">USB battery pack</a> is a must. As the name suggests, this also gives you the ability to power the device directly from USB so you can just plug it into your laptop if the juice in the battery runs out.</p>  <p>The other thing is that the Wi-Fi strength is pretty ordinary. By way of example, here’s how <a href=\"http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/\">inSSIDer</a> sees the Pineapple (in yellow, of course) versus my usual access point in blue from only about a foot away:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-PeooN0RcNQo/UW542mkm8rI/AAAAAAAAFLk/vtbIKh5vBsE/image72.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>However, mover into the next room and the Pineapple just about drops off altogether:</p>  <p><img title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-jaf-526cP-Y/UW543Cy7n2I/AAAAAAAAFLs/e4AQkrZDXro/image1011.png?imgmax=800\" width=\"850\" height=\"145\" /></p>  <p>There are <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/antennas\">a few different antenna options</a> so if your intended use doesn’t involve connecting to a target within a very, very close distance then this would be worth a look. Other than that though, the only other thing that <em>might</em> be useful is a handy case and given HakShop has <a href=\"http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple-holiday-bundle\">a Pineapple with battery and a case going for $115</a> at the time of writing, that’s probably your best bet.</p>  <p>The other thing that some people might find interesting is that a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/killuminati2012/wifipineapple/wiki\">the code running on the Pineapple is up on GitHub</a>. This is apparently the www folder of the device so it’s not the firmware itself, but it is a bunch of the PHP files and scripts which is kind of interesting to have a browse through.</p>  <h4>Responsible use</h4>  <p>I bought the Pineapple for the sole purpose of helping developers better understand the risks of insufficient transport layer security. You’re going to see me writing a lot more about the risks of loading logon forms over HTTP, embedding HTTPS login forms in HTTP pages, mixed mode HTTP / HTTPS and other similar risks. The Pineapple will help me move that discussion from a theoretical “An attacker might do this or could do that” to a very practical “Here, let me show you exactly why that pattern is risky”. Demonstrations of this kind are very powerful and they’re often the only way of getting the message through.</p>  <p>However, there is very clearly scope for misuse and abuse of unsuspecting victims. That incident I mentioned earlier where my wife walked into the room and suddenly I was watching <em>her</em> network traffic is a perfect example of how easy it is to do potentially evil things, sometimes without even trying. For those reading this and considering how they might use it, there are some great use cases for penetration testing or demoing (in)secure web app design but there is also some very, very thin ice out there. Caveat emptor.</p>  <h4>What next for the Pineapple?</h4>  <p>The great thing about the Pineapple is that it makes it dead easy to demonstrate a whole bunch of concepts that I often write about but haven’t always shown in execution. For example, <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html\">why it’s not ok to load login forms over HTTP even if they post to HTTPS</a>. Another one that has come up a few times (including in <a href=\"http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html\">the Top CashBack post</a>) is not embedding a login form that <em>is</em> loaded over HTTPS within an iframe in an HTTP page. There’s a whole heap of things that will be easily demonstrated within a controlled environment.</p>  <p>Then there’s the uncontrolled environment – the public. There’s a lot of grey area there about what can be done for the purposes of research and education without crossing the line into outright eavesdropping and getting on the wrong side of people. I do have some thoughts on it, but I’ll hold onto those for the moment…</p>  <p>Regardless, I’ll start producing some video material to demonstrate the ease with which this thing does its work because it’s immensely impressive to see in real time – at least <em>I</em> was impressed! I’ve already created a bit of video for a training program I’m putting together (more on that another day), and I reckon it comes up great. Stay tuned, there’s much, much more to come.</p>  <h4 align=\"left\">Useful Links</h4>  <ol>   <li><a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/25706-markiv-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know/?hl=%2Bext4+%2Bformatted+%2Busb+%2Bstick\">Markiv: What We Know And What We Don't Know</a> – good general overview of features and configuration </li>    <li><a href=\"http://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/26363-mark-4-setup-script/\">Mark 4 setup script</a> – very handy for seeing how to configure various things via the shell. </li>    <li><a href=\"http://hakinthebox.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/you-just-cant-trust-wireless-covertly.html\">You just can't trust wireless: covertly hijacking wifi and stealing passwords using sslstrip</a> – good view of defeating SSL with the device</li> </ol>  <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TroyHunt/~4/GmmL2ItpzB8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/Gd9epuFKI4M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>") (author nil "Troy Hunt") (pubDate nil "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 06:26:00 -0400") (feedburner:origLink nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TroyHunt/~3/GmmL2ItpzB8/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html"))) ("DevOps Integration Key to Avoiding Pre-Ordained Security Failures" "<p>BOSTON – Downstream is where you live today as a security person.

<br>
==Description==<br>
<br>
Expression Language (EL) Injection happens when attacker controlled data enters an EL interpreter. <br>
<br>
With EL implementations prior to 2.2, attacker can recover sensitive server side information available through implicit objects. This includes model objects, beans, session scope, application scope, etc. The EL 2.2 spec allows method invocation, which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code within context of the application. This can manipulate application functionality, expose sensitive data, and branch out into system code access-- posing a risk of server compromise.<br>
<br>
A specific pattern exists in certain version of the Spring Framework, where Spring JSP tags will double resolve EL. In versions prior to 3.0.6, it is not possible to disable this functionality, and the pattern must be avoided.<br>
<br>
<br>
==Risk Factors==<br>
<br>
The likelihood of this issue is '''Medium''', for the following reasons:<br>
*Certain attack scenarios are not overly sophisticated, although require some skill.<br>
*Automated tools may begin to pick up on the pattern, increasing the likelihood of discovery. <br>
*Attackers are highly motivated to discover code execution vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
The overall impact of this issue is '''High''', for the following reasons:<br>
* An attacker could modify and invoke functionality on the application server.<br>
* Unauthorized access to data and functionality, as well as account hijacking and remote code execution.<br>
* Confidentiality, and Integrity concerns from a successful attack.<br>
<br>
==Examples==<br>
<br>
=== Spring Message Tag ===<br>
The Spring Message tag will double resolve Expression Language.<br>
<br>
A common pattern of passing URL parameters to the message tag is:<br>
<br>
Controller.java<br>
@RequestMapping(value=&quot;/&quot;)<br>
String index() {<br>
<br>
if ( hasErrors() ) {<br>
return &quot;redirect:/error?msg=error.generic&quot;;<br>
} else {<br>
return &quot;index&quot;;<br>
}<br>
<br>
}<br>
<br>
error.jsp<br>
&lt;spring:message code=&quot;${param.msg}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL request to the above code of the form:<br>
?msg=${param.test}&amp;test=INJECTION<br>
<br>
Will result in the string literal &quot;INJECTION&quot; being passed to the message tag. The application should respond with an exception like:<br>
<br>
No message found under code 'INJECTION' for locale 'en_US'<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the attacker could submit methods within the EL like:<br>
?msg=${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;admin&quot;,true)}<br>
<br>
If the container provided EL interpreter does not support static class methods ( java.lang.Runtime.getCurrentRuntime().exec() ), an attacker can use a URLClassLoader to load remote code.<br>
<br>
<br>
=== Spring Eval Tag ===<br>
Spring Framework provides a JSP tag that interprets Spring Expression Language (SpEL).<br>
<br>
The following code would be vulnerable:<br>
&lt;spring:eval expression=&quot;${param.vulnerable}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL of the following form would provide system code access:<br>
?vulnerable=T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(“cmd.exe”)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==<br>
<br>
* [[Reflection injection]]<br>
* [[Injection problem]]<br>
<br>
==Related [[Controls]]==<br>
Avoid putting user data into an expression interpreter if possible. Otherwise, validate and/or encode the data to ensure it is not evaluated as expression language.<br>
* [[Input_Validation]]<br>
<br>
In the case of Spring Framework, disable the double resolution functionality in versions 3.0.6 and above by placing the following configuration in the application web.xml.<br>
<br>

<br>
==Description==<br>
<br>
Expression Language (EL) Injection happens when attacker controlled data enters an EL interpreter. <br>
<br>
With EL implementations prior to 2.2, attacker can recover sensitive server side information available through implicit objects. This includes model objects, beans, session scope, application scope, etc. The EL 2.2 spec allows method invocation, which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code within context of the application. This can manipulate application functionality, expose sensitive data, and branch out into system code access-- posing a risk of server compromise.<br>
<br>
A specific pattern exists in certain version of the Spring Framework, where Spring JSP tags will double resolve EL. In versions prior to 3.0.6, it is not possible to disable this functionality, and the pattern must be avoided.<br>
<br>
<br>
==Risk Factors==<br>
<br>
The likelihood of this issue is '''Medium''', for the following reasons:<br>
*Certain attack scenarios are not overly sophisticated, although require some skill.<br>
*Automated tools may begin to pick up on the pattern, increasing the likelihood of discovery. <br>
*Attackers are highly motivated to discover code execution vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
The overall impact of this issue is '''High''', for the following reasons:<br>
* An attacker could modify and invoke functionality on the application server.<br>
* Unauthorized access to data and functionality, as well as account hijacking and remote code execution.<br>
* Confidentiality, and Integrity concerns from a successful attack.<br>
<br>
==Examples==<br>
<br>
=== Spring Message Tag ===<br>
The Spring Message tag will double resolve Expression Language.<br>
<br>
A common pattern of passing URL parameters to the message tag is:<br>
<br>
Controller.java<br>
 @RequestMapping(value=&quot;/&quot;)<br>
    String index() {<br>
    	<br>
    	if ( hasErrors() ) {<br>
    		return &quot;redirect:/error?msg=error.generic&quot;;<br>
    	} else {<br>
    		return &quot;index&quot;;<br>
    	}<br>
    	<br>
    }<br>
<br>
error.jsp<br>
 &lt;spring:message code=&quot;${param.msg}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL request to the above code of the form:<br>
 ?msg=${param.test}&amp;test=INJECTION<br>
<br>
Will result in the string literal &quot;INJECTION&quot; being passed to the message tag. The application should respond with an exception like:<br>
<br>
 No message found under code 'INJECTION' for locale 'en_US'<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the attacker could submit methods within the EL like:<br>
 ?msg=${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;admin&quot;,true)}<br>
<br>
If the container provided EL interpreter does not support static class methods ( java.lang.Runtime.getCurrentRuntime().exec() ), an attacker can use a URLClassLoader to load remote code.<br>
<br>
<br>
=== Spring Eval Tag ===<br>
Spring Framework provides a JSP tag that interprets Spring Expression Language (SpEL).<br>
<br>
The following code would be vulnerable:<br>
 &lt;spring:eval expression=&quot;${param.vulnerable}&quot; /&gt;<br>
<br>
A URL of the following form would provide system code access:<br>
 ?vulnerable=T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(“cmd.exe”)<br>
<br>
<br>

* [[Interpreter Injection]]<br>
<br>
<br>
==Related [[Vulnerabilities]]==<br>
<br>
* [[Reflection injection]]<br>
* [[Injection problem]]<br>
<br>
==Related [[Controls]]==<br>
Avoid putting user data into an expression interpreter if possible. Otherwise, validate and/or encode the data to ensure it is not evaluated as expression language.<br>
* [[Input_Validation]]<br>
<br>
In the case of Spring Framework, disable the double resolution functionality in versions 3.0.6 and above by placing the following configuration in the application web.xml.<br>
<br>
    &lt;context-param&gt;<br>
         &lt;description&gt;Spring Expression Language Support&lt;/description&gt;<br>
         &lt;param-name&gt;springJspExpressionSupport&lt;/param-name&gt;<br>
         &lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;<br>
    &lt;/context-param&gt;<br>

<p>You can’t expect a pen tester to find all of the security vulnerabilities in your system – even if you are willing to spend a lot of time and money on it. But pen tests are important because this is a way to find things that are hard for you to find on your own:<ol>
<li>
Technology-specific and platform-specific vulnerabilities
</li>
<li>
Configuration and deployment mistakes in the run-time environment
</li>
<li>
Pointy-Hat problems in areas like authentication and session management that should have been taken care of by the framework that you are using, if it works and if you are using it properly
</li>
<li>
Fussy problems in information leakage, object enumeration and error handling – problems that look small to you but can be exploited by an intelligent and motivated attacker with time on their side
</li>
<li>
Mistakes in data validation or output encoding and filtering, that look small to you but…

In order to accomplish this we worked with the QA team at Mozilla to create a simple tool called Garmr to integrate automated security test cases as part of our continuous integration (CI) processes.</p>
<p>When we started the discussion about which tools to use, our requirements were pretty straightforward; it needed to be fast, simple, and accurate.  When we looked at Selenium and Mozmill the feedback we got from other teams is that although powerful, these frameworks were complex to configure properly, and had significant overhead to maintain as a project progresses.  Since the focus was on testing web applications in a repeatable fashion, we identified a set of required functionality and David Burns from the very awesome Mozilla QA team put together the Garmr prototype and initial test cases.</p>
<p>Garmr has been public since its initial version, but the tool has now reached the point where we will start to leverage it in our testing and CI processes.  The tool works by running a series of tests against target URLs and reporting back the results.  The results are currently formatted as a JUnit style XML report that can be consumed by other tools such as Jenkins.</p>
<h2>Garmr Test Cases</h2>
<p>Garmr currently supports two types of test cases that can be authored, an Active Test and a Passive Test.  ActiveTests are expected to make at least one HTTP request, and return the most relevant HTTP response after the check is completed.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an ActiveTest that makes a simple HTTP GET request:</p>
<div><div><pre><span>class</span> WebTouch<span>(</span>ActiveTest<span>)</span>:
run_passives = <span>True</span>
description = <span>&quot;Make a GET request to the specified URL, and check for a 200 response after resolving redirects.&quot;</span>
<span>def</span> do_test<span>(</span><span>self</span>, url<span>)</span>:
response = requests.<span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span>
<span>if</span> response.<span>status_code</span> == <span>200</span>:
result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Pass&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;The request returned an HTTP 200 response.&quot;</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>else</span>:
result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Fail&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;The response code was %s&quot;</span> <span>%</span> response.<span>status_code</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>(</span>result, response<span>)</span></pre></div></div>
<p>The test case makes an HTTP Get request, and passes or fails dependent on the response code.  This very basic check does serve a purpose; it grabs an HTTP response to run passive tests against.  For an example of a more complex check, look at the StsUpgradeCheck implemented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr/blob/master/Garmr/corechecks.py\">corechecks</a> module.</p>
<p>PassiveTest instances receive a copy of an HTTP response and analyze it to determine if the test passes or fails.  In most circumstances, Garmr will run all of the configured PassiveTests against the result of each ActiveTest.  The goal of a passive test is to inspect each the response of a query for properties that are expected from a secure web application.</p>
<p>This is an example of a passive test that checks an HTTP response for the presence of X-Frame-Options headers:</p>
<div><div><pre><span>class</span> XFrameOptionsPresent<span>(</span>PassiveTest<span>)</span>:
description = <span>&quot;Check if X-Frame-Options header is present.&quot;</span>
<span>def</span> analyze<span>(</span><span>self</span>, response<span>)</span>:
xfoheader = <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options&quot;</span>
xfo = xfoheader <span>in</span> response.<span>headers</span>
<span>if</span> xfo == <span>False</span>:
result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Fail&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options header not found.&quot;</span>, <span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>else</span>:
result = <span>self</span>.<span>result</span><span>(</span><span>&quot;Pass&quot;</span>, <span>&quot;X-Frame-Options header present.&quot;</span>, response.<span>headers</span><span>[</span>xfoheader<span>]</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> result</pre></div></div>
<p>The goal is to allow developers to create test cases that are specific to their applications and gain the benefit of running pedantic checks for security related attributes such as cookies and headers each step of the way.  Note that there is no practical limitation on what a passive check does, as long as the result object is returned properly.</p>
<h2>Using Garmr</h2>
<p>The current version of Garmr can be downloaded from the Github repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr\">https://github.com/ygjb/Garmr</a>.</p>
<p>Getting, installing, and using Garmr is very easy:</p>
<div><div><pre><span>git</span> clone https:<span>//</span>github.com<span>/</span>ygjb<span>/</span>Garmr.git
<span>cd</span> Garmr
<span>sudo</span> python setup.py <span>install</span>
garmr <span>-u</span> http:<span>//</span>my.target.app</pre></div></div>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Garmr is an alpha tool.  The only part of it that we expect to remain stable at this point is the Xml Report format that it produces, since this is specified by the Jenkins tool chain that we are integrating with.</p>
<p>This tool is not intended to replace a typical dynamic or static analysis tool any more than the existence of Unit Tests replaces end to end functional testing, but it does provide a simple facility for QA, development, and security teams to collaborate on web application testing.</p>
<p>Currently the tool can be used to run a number of simple tests, and supports the ability to load modules; two examples of how a module would be written are included in djangochecks.py and webchecks.py</p>
<p>There is a list of features still to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>less noisy CLI</li>
<li>proxy support (already supported in requests)</li>
<li>sessions (controlled; sequence for active tests, with a cookie jar that is propagated through the session)</li>
<li>detailed reporting, including the ability to record all HTTP requests and responses generated</li>
<li>the ability to filter which passive checks are run by check name or by check type (i.e. cookies, headers, content-type, etc)</li>
<li>support for additional protocols (websockets, spdy)</li>
<li>Implement instances of each test case for each target scanned to allow them to retain state as a set of tests progresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very excited to see how the tool will develop over the next few months as we have an intern who will be working to implement these and other features, so please test it out, give us feedback (patches and feature requests are welcome too!).</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OWASP/~4/Qqy94ugw28A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>" "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/Qqy94ugw28A/" (20136 49963) old 20 nil nil ((title nil "Automating Test Cases") (link nil "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OWASP/~3/Qqy94ugw28A/") (description nil "<p>Earlier this year I wrote about some of the challenges of scaling security efforts in an organization, and I mentioned that we are working to adopt better tooling to assist us in this.  We have been working towards improving security in the development lifecycle by making security tests a part of the quality assurance process.

<b>Abstract</b>. Attack-aware software applications provide attack detection and real-time defensive response with a very low false-positive rate. This technique allows an application to detect and neutralize a threat before the attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability. The approach is especially suited to soft-<br>ware applications with high information assurance requirements such as in the defense, critical national infrastructure, and financial service sectors to protect against cyber espionage, fraud, business logic abuse, tampering, and theft. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has developed a methodology, documentation, code and pilot demonstration which can be freely used to apply the concepts; this project is called AppSensor.</blockquote>

<b>Abstract</b>. Attack-aware software applications provide attack detection and real-time defensive response with a very low false-positive rate. This technique allows an application to detect and neutralize a threat before the attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability. The approach is especially suited to soft-<br>ware applications with high information assurance requirements such as in the defense, critical national infrastructure, and financial service sectors to protect against cyber espionage, fraud, business logic abuse, tampering, and theft. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has developed a methodology, documentation, code and pilot demonstration which can be freely used to apply the concepts; this project is called AppSensor.</blockquote>

But details of the attack remained shrouded in secrecy as the FBI and forensic investigators probed one of the biggest and most complex banking heists of its kind.</p>
<p>FIS said it had incurred a loss of approximately $13 million related to unauthorized activities involving one client and 22 prepaid cards on its Sunrise, Fla. based <strong>eFunds Prepaid Solutions</strong>, formerly <strong>WildCard Systems Inc.</strong>, which was acquired by FIS in 2007.</p>
<p>FIS stated: “The Company has identified that 7,170 prepaid accounts may have been at risk and that three individual cardholders’ non-public information may have been disclosed as a result of the unauthorized activities. FIS worked with the impacted clients to take appropriate action, including blocking and reissuing cards for the affected accounts. The Company has taken steps to further enhance security and continues to work with Federal law enforcement officials on this matter.” The disclosure was <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/176_84/fidelity_national_information_earnings-1036985-1.html\">scarcely noted</a> by news media.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity recently discovered previously undisclosed details of the successful escapade. According to sources close to the investigation, cyber thieves broke into the FIS network and targeted the Sunrise platform’s “open-loop” prepaid debit cards. The balances on these prepaid cards aren’t stored on the cards themselves; rather, the card numbers correspond to records in a central database, where the balances are recorded. Some prepaid cards cannot be used once their balance has been exhausted, but the prepaid cards used in this attack can be replenished by adding funds. Prepaid cards usually limit the amounts that cardholders can withdraw from a cash machine within a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Apparently, the crooks were able to drastically increase or eliminate the withdrawal limits for 22 prepaid cards that they had obtained. The fraudsters then cloned the prepaid cards, and distributed them to co-conspirators in several major cities across Europe, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p><span></span>Sources say the thieves waited until the close of business in the United States on Saturday, March 5, 2011, to launch their attack. Working into Sunday evening, conspirators in Greece, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom used the cloned cards to withdraw cash from dozens of ATMs. Armed with unauthorized access to FIS’s card platform, the crooks were able to reload the cards remotely when the cash withdrawals brought their balances close to zero.</p>
<p>It’s still not clear who was responsible for this attack on FIS. The company declined comment. The FBI would neither confirm nor deny that it is investigating. But the breach is eerily similar to an intricate 2008 attack against <strong>RBS WorldPay</strong>, an Atlanta-based unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland. In that heist, crooks obtained remote access to RBS’s systems and used 44 counterfeit prepaid cards to withdraw more than $9 million from at least 2,100 ATM terminals in 280 cities worldwide. The attack was so sophisticated and alarming that <strong>President Obama</strong> referred to it in <a title=\"Remarks by the President on Securing Our Nation's Cyber Infrastructure\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Securing-Our-Nations-Cyber-Infrastructure/\">a landmark cybersecurity speech.</a></p>
<p>Federal prosecutors <a title=\"NY Times: U.S. Indicts 8 in Worldwide Hacking Ring\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/business/global/12atm.html\">alleged</a> that the 2008 RBS theft was orchestrated by at least eight men from Estonia and Russia — the alleged ringleader was <a title=\"Alleged Ring Leader Extradited in $9.4m RBS WorldPay Heist\" href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/07/rbs_worldpay_extradition/\">extradited</a> to face charges in the United States.</p>
<p>Another key figure in that case was <strong>Viktor Pleschuk</strong> of St. Petersburg, Russia, who monitored the fraudulent ATM withdrawals remotely and in real-time using compromised systems within the payment card network. Pleschuk and Russian accomplice <strong>Eugene Anikin</strong> were arrested and charged in Russia. Prosecutors asked the court for five- and six-year sentences, but those requests were ignored. Pleschuk and Anikin agreed to plead guilty for their roles in the RBS heist in exchange for<a title=\"Hacker 3 Escapes Jail Time in RBS WorldPay ATM Heist\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/hacker-3-escapes-jail-time-in-rbs-worldpay-atm-heist/8096\"> suspended sentences</a> (probation, but no jail time).</p>

<p>KrebsOnSecurity recently discovered previously undisclosed details of the successful escapade. According to sources close to the investigation, cyber thieves broke into the FIS network and targeted the Sunrise platform’s “open-loop” prepaid debit cards. The balances on these prepaid cards aren’t stored on the cards themselves; rather, the card numbers correspond to records in a central database, where the balances are recorded. Some prepaid cards cannot be used once their balance has been exhausted, but the prepaid cards used in this attack can be replenished by adding funds. Prepaid cards usually limit the amounts that cardholders can withdraw from a cash machine within a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>Apparently, the crooks were able to drastically increase or eliminate the withdrawal limits for 22 prepaid cards that they had obtained. The fraudsters then cloned the prepaid cards, and distributed them to co-conspirators in several major cities across Europe, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p><span></span>Sources say the thieves waited until the close of business in the United States on Saturday, March 5, 2011, to launch their attack. Working into Sunday evening, conspirators in Greece, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom used the cloned cards to withdraw cash from dozens of ATMs. Armed with unauthorized access to FIS’s card platform, the crooks were able to reload the cards remotely when the cash withdrawals brought their balances close to zero.</p>
<p>It’s still not clear who was responsible for this attack on FIS. The company declined comment. The FBI would neither confirm nor deny that it is investigating. But the breach is eerily similar to an intricate 2008 attack against <strong>RBS WorldPay</strong>, an Atlanta-based unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland. In that heist, crooks obtained remote access to RBS’s systems and used 44 counterfeit prepaid cards to withdraw more than $9 million from at least 2,100 ATM terminals in 280 cities worldwide. The attack was so sophisticated and alarming that <strong>President Obama</strong> referred to it in <a title=\"Remarks by the President on Securing Our Nation's Cyber Infrastructure\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Securing-Our-Nations-Cyber-Infrastructure/\">a landmark cybersecurity speech.</a></p>
<p>Federal prosecutors <a title=\"NY Times: U.S. Indicts 8 in Worldwide Hacking Ring\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/business/global/12atm.html\">alleged</a> that the 2008 RBS theft was orchestrated by at least eight men from Estonia and Russia — the alleged ringleader was <a title=\"Alleged Ring Leader Extradited in $9.4m RBS WorldPay Heist\" href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/07/rbs_worldpay_extradition/\">extradited</a> to face charges in the United States.</p>
<p>Another key figure in that case was <strong>Viktor Pleschuk</strong> of St. Petersburg, Russia, who monitored the fraudulent ATM withdrawals remotely and in real-time using compromised systems within the payment card network. Pleschuk and Russian accomplice <strong>Eugene Anikin</strong> were arrested and charged in Russia. Prosecutors asked the court for five- and six-year sentences, but those requests were ignored. Pleschuk and Anikin agreed to plead guilty for their roles in the RBS heist in exchange for<a title=\"Hacker 3 Escapes Jail Time in RBS WorldPay ATM Heist\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/hacker-3-escapes-jail-time-in-rbs-worldpay-atm-heist/8096\"> suspended sentences</a> (probation, but no jail time).</p>
