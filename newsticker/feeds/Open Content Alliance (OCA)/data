This is news of monumental importance, not only for history buffs but in support of a democratic society. Openness is happening, and that&#8217;s a Good Thing.</p><p>Openness in our world of metadata is also happening, although we&#8217;re less likely to read about it in the newspaper. Over the last few weeks and months numerous libraries have freed their data from its dark web data store and made it available for open access. What has been a trickle from library catalogs may be turning into a wave.</p><p>In January of this year, the library at CERN in Switzerland published its catalog as Open Data on the Web. The <a href=\"http://library.web.cern.ch/library/Library/announcement.html\">announcement</a> stated:</p><blockquote><p>Librarians are in general very favourable to the principles of Open Access, but surprisingly few libraries have so far set free the data <a href=\"http://howtoproducemoresperm.org\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#777777;\">they produce</a> themselves. As one of the first scientific libraries in the world, the CERN Library offers now the bibliographic book records, held in its library catalog, to be freely downloaded by any third party. The records are provided under the Public Domain Data License, a license that permits colleagues around the world to reuse and upgrade the data for any purpose.</p></blockquote><p>The announcement also calls for other libraries to follow suit, in particular libraries and institutions that are signatories to the <a href=\"http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html\">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.</a></p><p>In February, The Ghent University Library announced that it now makes available a full dump of its <a href=\"http://lib.ugent.be/info/en/exports.shtml\">catalog data</a>. This data is being made available under the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/\">Open Database License.</a></p><p>On the 12th of March, the <a href=\"http://www.ub.uni-koeln.de/\">University and City Library of Cologne</a> announced the open release of approximately 3 million bibliographic records from its catalog. The Library has released the data using Creative Commons license <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a>, which places the data in the public domain. Over 600 downloads, from around the world, were recorded at the site in the first day after the announcement, proof that there is an active need for shared bibliographic metadata. Those wishing to follow the project can gather at the <a href=\"http://opendata.hbz-nrw.de/\">Linked Open Data </a>site, which also has pointers to the file downloads. The project hopes to offer the data in a Linked Data format in the near future.</p><p>Other libraries have made their data available with less fanfare, but their quiet contributions were often pioneering. The Open Library&#8217;s <a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/about/help\">data source</a> page lists over two dozen sources of bibliographic data from libraries, and yet others from publishers. This data is loaded into the Open Library, whose catalog is available for <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">download</a> either in bulk or through APIs.</p><p>In support of this growing movement to make bibliographic data available for use and re-use, the <a href=\"http://okfn.org\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> has announced a new <a href=\"http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography\">working group on open bibliographic data</a>. The <a href=\"http://ckan.net/\">comprehensive knowledge archive network</a>, a registry of open data and content, has a page for registering <a href=\"http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic\">open bibliographic data sets</a>. And of course, in the interest of LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) and of contributing to the Open Library project, anyone with bibliographic data is encourage to upload their data to the <a href=\"http://archive.org\">Internet Archive</a> following these <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">simple instructions</a>. (Note that <a href=\"http://mastomatic2.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#000000\" title=\"sex toys\">there</a> are copies of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cologne_data\">Cologne</a> data and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cern_marcxml\">CERN</a> data on the Archive.)</p><p>And if all of this doesn&#8217;t serve to convince you that open bibliographic data is HERE NOW, the rumor mill tells us that the <a href=\"http://w3c.org/\">World Wide Web consortium</a> is forming a working group on library bibliographic data and the semantic web, with at least one of its goals to help libraries participate in the <a href=\"http://linkeddata.org/\">Linked Open Data</a> movement and become better integrated with other data on the web. I have no doubt that there are exciting and rewarding times ahead for libraries.</p>

They deserve correction.</p><p>Google Founder Sergey Brin said: &#8220;[T]he companies that are making objections about out of print books are doing nothing for out of print books, MSFT and Amazon.&#8221;</p><p>This is twisted at best.  There are around <a href=\"http://thepublicindex.org/\">400 objections to the settlement</a> objecting to Google&#8217;s treatment of out-of-print books&#8211;  companies, libraries and even countries.   And many of us are objecting because we have been working together for years on the mass scanning of out-of-print books&#8211; and have worked to get books online for far longer than Google&#8211; and Google&#8217;s &#8220;settlement&#8221; could hurt our efforts. A major part of our efforts have concentrated on changing the law so everyone would benefit.</p><p>The Internet Archive&#8217;s effort to free &#8220;orphan works&#8221; (a name that I coined in the books context for when the rightsowner is unknown or not available to negotiate for use of the work), had been an active project for years before Google announced they were scanning library books.   As early as 2002 the Archive was participating in the Million Books project when we acquired a hundred thousand books for scanning.   Because many of these books wound up being orphans, their digitization was partial and significantly delayed.   Today, the Million Books project holds over 1.4 million books that have been scanned at public expense, but are not publicly viewable because of the lack of clarity on orphan works.</p><p>In March of 2004, the Internet Archive filed a <a href=\"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/case/kahle-v-gonzales\">suit</a> in a Federal Court in an attempt to free the Orphan Works in a challenge of current U.S. copyright legislation.</p><p>Google announced their library scanning project in December 2004 &#8212; therefore, they did not even publicly start until the Gordian Knot of orphan works had been a very public and ongoing problem for those of us already trying to make books available to the public.</p><p>Google&#8217;s CEO Schmidt said the opponents should: &#8220;propose an alternative to solve the problem&#8221;</p><p>There is an alternative, and they know it &#8212; orphan works legislation &#8212; that up until the last session of Congress had been working its way through the House and Senate.  It was not perfect, but was getting close to what we need.  Best yet, it passed one house  &#8212; at least until Google effectively sideswiped the process with their settlement proposal.   The settlement has been seen as solving the orphan books issue, which has served to enervate efforts to pass a bill.  If Google were to abandon its attempt to grab these books for its own private gain, then technology companies and libraries could speak with a strong voice, speaking in unison, working together to get proper legislation passed.</p><p>That is the alternative and Google could help, and I hope now does help, and stop hurting the process.</p><p>Lets free the orphans, not have them pass from their legal limbo into a life controlled by Google and its proposed Books Rights Registry.</p><p>Orphan Works and Mass Scanning Timeline:</p><p><a href=\"http://search.library.cmu.edu/rooms/documents/libraries-and-collections/Libraries/MBP_FAQ.html\">Million Books</a> scanning partially halted based on this problem: 2002.<br /><a href=\"http://www.publicknowledge.org/issues/hr2601\">Public Domain Enhancement Act</a> to deal with this introduced: June 2003.<br /><a href=\"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/case/kahle-v-gonzales\">Orphan Works complaint filed</a>:  March 2004.<br /><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/14/technology/14google.html?fta=y\">Google library scanning</a> was announced in December 2004.<br />

But interestingly, Google could only make a settlement where they were the only beneficiary because this was done as a class-action suit.  This bizarre circumstance means they could not offer their protection to any others because the others were not party to the suit and they wanted a small room to negotiate in &#8212; you can only commit others with a law or judicial approval.   So they set out to allow their monopoly to be blown and still rule the day.   Yes, they seem to have set this up so that they win if the Justice Department objected and said &#8220;anyone has to be able to get the deal that you got.&#8221;  (This idea of non-exclusive access is consistent with the rhetoric that Google has been slathering on the media for the last several months.)  And then, voila, Google would fall back on the 2nd tier monopoly, the Books Rights Registry, to allow them to control all out-of-print books.  Justice would then look like they got something, when in fact, they did not.</p><p>Not following me?   Sorry, but let me take another shot.    Let&#8217;s say the Justice Department says &#8220;anyone else should be able to do what Google has just negotiated for itself&#8221; and allows the judge to approve this complicated mess-of-a-settlement or goes to Congress who obliges with a law to that effect.   Then, Google, with a five-year head start, and setting out the rules of how the Books Rights Registry works, gets to be the only compelling offering for libraries to subscribe to.   If you get a five-year head start AND write the rules of the game, then if you lose, you are an idiot.  And if there is something we should all be sure of, these lawyers are not idiots.</p><p>So how do we know if we are being played?  At the end of the day, if the Books Rights Registry is allowed to control and collect money for the Orphan Works, then we have been had.   Remember, this is all about controlling the Orphans, or out-of-print works.   These works are those that are too expensive to research to figure out if they are the property of publishers or authors or even if they knew they would want them accessible.  The contracts are often hard to track down and they are not making money anyway.   If an organization gets to control the orphans, then they can determine who can have a complete library and on what terms.</p><p>The Book Rights Registry that has been designed by this cabal, which would be controlled by a few of the lawyers that wrote this settlement,  would control the out-of-print/Orphan works and be able to charge whatever they wanted for them.  Google, who has said they have scanned 10 million books, is off to a healthy head start.   A subscription service of <em>bundled</em> services will favor those with the most books, hence Google wins.</p><p>So what should we do to change this outcome?</p><p><strong>Only one thing needs to be changed:</strong> Don&#8217;t let anyone control the Orphans/Out-of-print.  Only if an owner comes forward and prove they own a work (with penalties for overreaching, and not just weak anyone-can-claim-anything-with-no-negative-consequences as it is proposed now)  then they can  negotiate for money.  Otherwise Orphan/Out-of-Print works can be used by anyone, say, for non-commercial use.   This is roughly how the <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/\">Orphan Works legislation</a> works, which <a href=\"http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.2913:\">almost made it through congress</a> last session.  But it should not be surprising that these guys are trying to substitute a closed system for that open approach.</p><p>What would happen if no one controlled the orphans?  Is would be best for the industry, best for libraries, publishers, authors, and best for the general public.</p><ul><li> Even Google would be better off because they would be able to make the Orphans available to everyone not just to subscribers. (Remember, they are an advertising based business.)</li></ul><ul><li> The AAP would also be serving their publishers because Google would not be the only game in town to negotiate with.</li></ul><ul><li> Libraries would be better off because they could digitize, preserve, and provide access to millions of digitized books for researchers historians scholars and the general public.</li></ul><ul><li> The Authors Guild would be better off because they could build membership by offering to negotiate on authors behalf with many parties.</li></ul><ul><li> Many author associations and registries would compete to <a href=\"http://buydissertations.net/\">provide good services</a> to those that sign up with them.</li></ul><ul><li> Authors would be better off because this would help create a diverse ecology of publishers, libraries, and readers.</li></ul><ul><li> The general public would be better off because they would leverage many search engines and many reading devices to buy and borrow digital books from many different booksellers and libraries.</li></ul><ul><li>The only loser is the Books Rights Registry, but it does not even exist yet.</li></ul><p>This would be the World Wide Web of Books that we have been dreaming of rather than a Monopoly of Books.  Google has helped build momentum &#8212; let&#8217;s take it the rest of the way without blowing it.   This could be done by Congress or the Justice Department &#8212; both of which are working on this right now.</p><p>Free the Orphans.</p>

Instead, it builds a centralized library under the control of one private corporation accountable first and foremost to its shareholders and one registry motivated by profit maximization for rightsholders who come forward.

And we hope that they do it in a way that is honest and forthright, not self-serving and diversionary.  At the Internet Archive, we believe that the right way to gain access to orphan books is to not break the law while you are doing it, and to work through Congress to ensure that the people&#8217;s voice in copyright is articulated the way the system was designed to work, not through a private, secret deal that we&#8217;re being assured is in our best interests by Google.  For the browsing, lending, and vending of digital books, the Archive is seeking an open and competitive market with appropriate <a href=\"https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=433\">safeguards for readers</a>, not a monopoly bookstore created by the biggest online advertising company in the world.</p><p><strong>No one elected Google to write copyright law for America</strong>.  And the Author’s Guild and American Association of Publishers simply do not accurately represent the diverse cross-section of those communities.  If Google is really interested in honoring our legislative process, let&#8217;s acknowledge that Congress is the path that our government chose to make copyright law and codify its exceptions &#8212; instead of crafting secret deals through class action settlements.</p><p>To that end, we are calling on Google to petition the court and seek a delay to the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/17045068/Google-Books-Department-of-Justice-Investigation-Letter\">October hearing</a> regarding the settlement. Furthermore, we demand that Google publicly demonstrate their leadership and influence in DC to immediately fuel the legislative process on orphan works.  That way, they could be part of a truly &#8220;non-exclusive&#8221; deal by ensuring that all stakeholders are provided the same set of rules from Day 1.</p><p>We await Google’s response.</p>

Google claims that anyone can scan these books &#8212; but no one else has the same legal protections that Google has.  Would the parties to the settlement amend the settlement to extend legal liability indemnification to any and all digitizers of orphan works?  If not, why not leave orphans out of the settlement and compel a legislative solution instead of striking a private deal in a District Court?</p><p>The Book Rights Registry Monopoly: The settlement creates what is effectively a monopoly in the Book Rights Registry. The Books Rights Registry will be a privately-held, privately-administered exclusive marketplace where digitized books are priced.  Why should this function be handed over to a monopoly controlled through the Authors Guild and AAP?  Why can’t there be an open framework that allows for more than one registry – giving rights holders and others a choice?  For domain names, consumers and businesses have a choice of where to register a domain name – creating competition.  Would Google and its monopoly partners endorse an open registry system?</p><p>Privacy: Despite repeated requests, Google has declined to give any details about what privacy controls it would put in place on its Book Search product. Will Google track the books that we are reading and make this information available to sell advertising against it? Will Google refuse to share information with the government about what books people are reading, as libraries routinely do? Will Google even publish a robust privacy policy on its Book Search product before the settlement issue is resolved?</p><p>More and more people are recognizing the Google Book Settlement for what it really is — an insider deal cut between powerful, private interests that creates a profit-making monopoly over the greatest source of our culture’s common knowledge. We urge everyone who cares about books to come to their rescue.</p>

This is news of monumental importance, not only for history buffs but in support of a democratic society. Openness is happening, and that’s a Good Thing.</p><p>Openness in our world of metadata is also happening, although we’re less likely to read about it in the newspaper. Over the last few weeks and months numerous libraries have freed their data from its dark web data store and made it available for open access. What has been a trickle from library catalogs may be turning into a wave.</p><p>In January of this year, the library at CERN in Switzerland published its catalog as Open Data on the Web. The <a href=\"http://library.web.cern.ch/library/Library/announcement.html\">announcement</a> stated:</p><blockquote><p>Librarians are in general very favourable to the principles of Open Access, but surprisingly few libraries have so far set free the data <a href=\"http://howtoproducemoresperm.org\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#777777;\">they produce</a> themselves. As one of the first scientific libraries in the world, the CERN Library offers now the bibliographic book records, held in its library catalog, to be freely downloaded by any third party. The records are provided under the Public Domain Data License, a license that permits colleagues around the world to reuse and upgrade the data for any purpose.</p></blockquote><p>The announcement also calls for other libraries to follow suit, in particular libraries and institutions that are signatories to the <a href=\"http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html\">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.</a></p><p>In February, The Ghent University Library announced that it now makes available a full dump of its <a href=\"http://lib.ugent.be/info/en/exports.shtml\">catalog data</a>. This data is being made available under the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/\">Open Database License.</a></p><p>On the 12th of March, the <a href=\"http://www.ub.uni-koeln.de/\">University and City Library of Cologne</a> announced the open release of approximately 3 million bibliographic records from its catalog. The Library has released the data using Creative Commons license <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a>, which places the data in the public domain. Over 600 downloads, from around the world, were recorded at the site in the first day after the announcement, proof that there is an active need for shared bibliographic metadata. Those wishing to follow the project can gather at the <a href=\"http://opendata.hbz-nrw.de/\">Linked Open Data </a>site, which also has pointers to the file downloads. The project hopes to offer the data in a Linked Data format in the near future.</p><p>Other libraries have made their data available with less fanfare, but their quiet contributions were often pioneering. The Open Library’s <a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/about/help\">data source</a> page lists over two dozen sources of bibliographic data from libraries, and yet others from publishers. This data is loaded into the Open Library, whose catalog is available for <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">download</a> either in bulk or through APIs.</p><p>In support of this growing movement to make bibliographic data available for use and re-use, the <a href=\"http://okfn.org\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> has announced a new <a href=\"http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography\">working group on open bibliographic data</a>. The <a href=\"http://ckan.net/\">comprehensive knowledge archive network</a>, a registry of open data and content, has a page for registering <a href=\"http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic\">open bibliographic data sets</a>. And of course, in the interest of LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) and of contributing to the Open Library project, anyone with bibliographic data is encourage to upload their data to the <a href=\"http://archive.org\">Internet Archive</a> following these <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">simple instructions</a>. (Note that <a href=\"http://mastomatic2.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#000000\" title=\"sex toys\">there</a> are copies of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cologne_data\">Cologne</a> data and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cern_marcxml\">CERN</a> data on the Archive.)</p><p>And if all of this doesn’t serve to convince you that open bibliographic data is HERE NOW, the rumor mill tells us that the <a href=\"http://w3c.org/\">World Wide Web consortium</a> is forming a working group on library bibliographic data and the semantic web, with at least one of its goals to help libraries participate in the <a href=\"http://linkeddata.org/\">Linked Open Data</a> movement and become better integrated with other data on the web.

This is news of monumental importance, not only for history buffs but in support of a democratic society. Openness is happening, and that&#8217;s a Good Thing.</p><p>Openness in our world of metadata is also happening, although we&#8217;re less likely to read about it in the newspaper. Over the last few weeks and months numerous libraries have freed their data from its dark web data store and made it available for open access. What has been a trickle from library catalogs may be turning into a wave.</p><p>In January of this year, the library at CERN in Switzerland published its catalog as Open Data on the Web. The <a href=\"http://library.web.cern.ch/library/Library/announcement.html\">announcement</a> stated:</p><blockquote><p>Librarians are in general very favourable to the principles of Open Access, but surprisingly few libraries have so far set free the data <a href=\"http://howtoproducemoresperm.org\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#777777;\">they produce</a> themselves. As one of the first scientific libraries in the world, the CERN Library offers now the bibliographic book records, held in its library catalog, to be freely downloaded by any third party. The records are provided under the Public Domain Data License, a license that permits colleagues around the world to reuse and upgrade the data for any purpose.</p></blockquote><p>The announcement also calls for other libraries to follow suit, in particular libraries and institutions that are signatories to the <a href=\"http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html\">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.</a></p><p>In February, The Ghent University Library announced that it now makes available a full dump of its <a href=\"http://lib.ugent.be/info/en/exports.shtml\">catalog data</a>. This data is being made available under the <a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/\">Open Database License.</a></p><p>On the 12th of March, the <a href=\"http://www.ub.uni-koeln.de/\">University and City Library of Cologne</a> announced the open release of approximately 3 million bibliographic records from its catalog. The Library has released the data using Creative Commons license <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">CC0</a>, which places the data in the public domain. Over 600 downloads, from around the world, were recorded at the site in the first day after the announcement, proof that there is an active need for shared bibliographic metadata. Those wishing to follow the project can gather at the <a href=\"http://opendata.hbz-nrw.de/\">Linked Open Data </a>site, which also has pointers to the file downloads. The project hopes to offer the data in a Linked Data format in the near future.</p><p>Other libraries have made their data available with less fanfare, but their quiet contributions were often pioneering. The Open Library&#8217;s <a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/about/help\">data source</a> page lists over two dozen sources of bibliographic data from libraries, and yet others from publishers. This data is loaded into the Open Library, whose catalog is available for <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">download</a> either in bulk or through APIs.</p><p>In support of this growing movement to make bibliographic data available for use and re-use, the <a href=\"http://okfn.org\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> has announced a new <a href=\"http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography\">working group on open bibliographic data</a>. The <a href=\"http://ckan.net/\">comprehensive knowledge archive network</a>, a registry of open data and content, has a page for registering <a href=\"http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic\">open bibliographic data sets</a>. And of course, in the interest of LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) and of contributing to the Open Library project, anyone with bibliographic data is encourage to upload their data to the <a href=\"http://archive.org\">Internet Archive</a> following these <a href=\"http://upstream.openlibrary.org/data\">simple instructions</a>. (Note that <a href=\"http://mastomatic2.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#000000\" title=\"sex toys\">there</a> are copies of the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cologne_data\">Cologne</a> data and <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/cern_marcxml\">CERN</a> data on the Archive.)</p><p>And if all of this doesn&#8217;t serve to convince you that open bibliographic data is HERE NOW, the rumor mill tells us that the <a href=\"http://w3c.org/\">World Wide Web consortium</a> is forming a working group on library bibliographic data and the semantic web, with at least one of its goals to help libraries participate in the <a href=\"http://linkeddata.org/\">Linked Open Data</a> movement and become better integrated with other data on the web. I have no doubt that there are exciting and rewarding times ahead for libraries.</p>
