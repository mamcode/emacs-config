The development Activity Board <a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/blog/2012/09/providing-a-unified-view-of-openstack-projects/\">announced few months ago</a> provides a visual overview of all the OpenStack public activity of community members across multiple dimensions: contributors and organizations, projects and tools. From a single interface, you can easily surf OpenStack project content, whether it is coming from the LaunchPad bug tracker, Git or Gerrit, all mapped against the OpenStack Foundation members database. Join the <a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/ebbf37e343246e0b80bf99540a0c8d86\">session at the Summit</a> to learn more and give feedback.</p><h3><a href=\"http://fnords.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/the-need-for-releases/\">The need for releases</a></h3><p>The beginning of a new release cycle is as good as any moment to question why we actually go through the hassle of producing OpenStack releases. <a href=\"https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Release_Cycle\" target=\"_blank\">Twice per year</a>, on a precise date we announce 6 months in advance, we bless and publish source code tarballs of the various integrated projects in OpenStack. Every week we have a <a href=\"https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/ProjectMeeting\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> that tracks our progress toward this common goal. Read Thierry&#8217;s post if you want to know why.</p><h3><a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/e45f299aad360fea432241f9b6067eca#.UWaWlrXLo2w\">International Community Forum – Wednesday April 17 3.40pm in A105</a></h3><p>If you are travelling to the OpenStack Summit from afar, we are holding an International Forum where we would like you to come along with your answer to the following question, “What’s an important, unique and interesting thing about OpenStack in my country”. The aim of the session is to share the answers so that we all might learn and gather new ideas for the improvement of the OpenStack community around the world!” It will be great to see just how many countries we can see represented in the one room, and a great opportunity for international networking.</p><h3><a href=\"http://cloudystuffhappens.blogspot.com/2013/04/understanding-nova-conductor-in.html\">Understanding nova-conductor in OpenStack Nova</a></h3><p>Nova conductor is a new service in Nova introduced in the Grizzly release. It as one of the top three changes in Nova in the Grizzly cycle, along with bare metal provisioning and cell. In this article, <a href=\"http://cloudystuffhappens.blogspot.com/search/label/openstack\">Yun Mao</a> discusses its pros and cons to help you understand it better.</p><h3><a href=\"http://markmail.org/message/w37tv4bgzxld7x4a\">OpenStack Networking, use of &#8220;Quantum&#8221;</a></h3><p>We have to phase out the trademark or attention getting use of the code name &#8220;Quantum&#8221; when referring to the the OpenStack Networking project, as part of a legal agreement with Quantum Corporation, the owner of the &#8220;Quantum&#8221; trademark. The Board of Directors and Technical Committee members involved in Networking related development and documentation were notified so we could start working to remove &#8220;Quantum&#8221; from public references.</p><p>At the summit we have a session scheduled to talk about project names generally and the path forward for OpenStack Networking specifically. For instance, in places where there is a need for something shorter, such as the CLI, we could come up with a new code name or use something more descriptive like &#8220;os-network.&#8221; This is a question it probably makes sense to look at across projects at the same time. If you have input on this, please come participate in the session Thursday April 18 at 4:10pm: <a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/95df68f88b519a3e4981ed9da7cd1de5#.UWWOZBnR16A\">http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/95df68f88b519a3e4981ed9da7cd1de5#.UWWOZBnR16A</a></p><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2><ul><li>By <a href=\"http://jaegerandi.blogspot.com/search/label/OpenStack\">Andreas Jaeger</a>: <a href=\"http://jaegerandi.blogspot.com/2013/04/chef-and-crowbar-for-setting-up.html\">Chef and Crowbar for setting up OpenStack clouds &#8211;

From a single interface, you can easily surf OpenStack project content, whether it is coming from the LaunchPad bug tracker, Git or Gerrit, all mapped against the OpenStack Foundation members database.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Vision Behind the Activity Board</h2><p>The intention is to give the community a way to answer very precise questions like: who’s contributing to that particular feature of OpenStack? What is that developer/company working on? Which commits/changes are related to a particular bug? Who’s joined the development community recently? With the Activity Board, we have integrated information across the different systems used to develop OpenStack to give corporate and community users a unified view of all the efforts going into OpenStack. There are two main parts of the Activity Board: the Dash and the Insights. The Dash contains reports built by<a href=\"http://www.bitergia.com/\"> Bitergia</a> using the free software suite<a href=\"https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/\"> MetricsGrimoire,</a> it focuses on trends and quantitative presentation. The Insights, enriched with a semantic layer, powered by<a href=\"http://sanjiva.typepad.com/thescurve/2013/04/wikidsmart-for-openstack-is-live.html\"> zAgile</a>’s open source Wikidsmart adds qualitative details with faceted search of concepts across all the different repositories, tracing people and artifacts across different repositories and bug tracker in order to reconcile people and corresponding contributions.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Looking to the Future</h2><p>With the integration, we know that we can become a much more efficient project in terms of communicating to members, monitoring our progress, and getting work done. The project is its infancy and we wish to continue to evolve the solution and enhance it with everyone’s feedback. First of all we need you to look at the data and let us know if you find any mistake (we&#8217;re<a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-community/+bugs?field.tag=activityboard\"> keeping a log of known issues</a>). There are a number of areas we want to consider, for example:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Streamline the faceted search interface according to the community’s desires</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Add more reports based on community requests</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Add integration with other OpenStack project data sources (<a href=\"http://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack\">blueprints</a>, <a href=\"http://lists.openstack.org\">mailing lists</a>, <a href=\"http://ask.openstack.org\">Ask</a>, user groups, IRC)</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Potentially enable interoperability (which is inherent in the Wikidsmart abilities) so that an event in one tool, for example LaunchPad, kicks off another action or update within another tool</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Remove the dependency on Confluence, port the visualization to an open source wiki or portal,</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Publish all the code and tools, integrate the Activity board in the OpenStack infrastructure processes</li></ul><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Learn More</h2><p>If you would like to learn more, we are featuring the OpenStack Activity Board in the upcoming events:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/ebbf37e343246e0b80bf99540a0c8d86\">OpenStack Summit</a>, April 15, Portland, OR:<a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/ebbf37e343246e0b80bf99540a0c8d86\"> one long session to show the state of the art</a> and to<a href=\"http://openstacksummitapril2013.sched.org/event/987980385498d2c4caacf043f4fe922b\"> gather feedback</a></li><li dir=\"ltr\">Webinar, May 2, 9am Pacific Time:<a href=\"http://openstack.enterthemeeting.com/m/5QNKEX2G\"> Introducing OpenStack Activity Board, A Unified View of OpenStack Project Content</a></li></ul><p>I look forward to your comments and further collaboration to make sure this solution benefits the whole community to the maximum extent.</p>

A new load-balancing-as-a-service (LBaaS) framework and API will bring another wave of investment and innovation in the coming months.  To deliver on the choice users are demanding,  we saw new plugins from Big Switch, Hyper-V, PlumGrid, Brocade and Midonet in addition to the existing support for Open vSwitch, Cisco UCS/Nexus, Linux Bridge, Nicira, Ryu OpenFlow, and NEC OpenFlow.  And many others are releasing plug ins now, including Arista, Extreme Networks, Ruijie, and Mellanox.

In #openstack-101 <a href=\"http://vmartinezdelacruz.com/\">Victoria Martínez de la Cruz</a> met many people wanting to start contributing to OpenStack, but a lot of them didn’t know how to provide the right information to see where the problem was when they were facing a blocker. A must read for anybody starting (and a handy bookmark to provide to people stuck somewhere).</p><h3><a href=\"http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/openstack-climate-capacity-leasing\">Announcing Climate, the OpenStack capacity leasing project</a></h3><p>A capacity leasing service is something really needed by service providers, especially in the context of cloud platforms dedicated to HPC style workload. Instead of building something really specific, the decision has been made to build a new standalone OpenStack components aiming to provide this kind of functionnality to OpenStack. In the spirit of others OpenStack components, it will be extensible to fullfil a large panel of needs around this problematic.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/blog/2013/03/participate-in-the-first-openstack-user-survey/\">Participate in the first OpenStack User Survey!</a></h3><p>If you are an OpenStack user or have customers with OpenStack deployments, please take 10 minutes to respond to our first User Survey or pass it along to your network.

The NIC (and the network in general) is always thought of as a consumable resource involved in a data transfer. To a lesser extent the disk bandwidth is considered, and on occasion the system bus is as well. However, the effects on the CPU tend to be underestimated.

This release, more than any before it, was driven by users who have been running OpenStack in production for the past year (or more) and have asked for broader support for the compute, storage, and networking technologies they trust and even greater scale and ease of operations. <a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/blog/2013/04/openstack-grizzly/\">Mark Collier’s</a> post has a summary of the new features and a screencast of the updated OpenStack Dashboard.</p><h4><a href=\"http://blog.aaronorosen.com/building-a-multi-tier-application-with-openstack/\">Building a Multi-Tier Application With OpenStack</a></h4><p>In his blog post <a href=\"http://blog.aaronorosen.com/\">Aaron Rosen</a> shows how to build a simple multi-tier application on OpenStack, something that is made possible by the new features of OpenStack Grizzly: security groups and about Load-balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS).</p><h3><a href=\"http://technicae.cogitat.io/2013/04/autoscale-and-orchestration-heat-of.html\">Autoscale and Orchestration: the Heat of OpenStack</a></h3><p>Duncan McGreggor tells the story of how OpenStack orchestration service (codename Heat) is gaining new autoscaling features thanks to increased efforts by Rackspace. Following discussions at Pycon, Rackspace’s management decided to add two development teams to Heat and add some of the features that initially they were developing internally. Another good story of different companies collaborating inside the OpenStack Community.</p><h3><a href=\"http://blog.hendrikvolkmer.de/2013/04/03/there-will-be-no-reliable-cloud-part-1/\">There will be no reliable cloud (part 1)</a></h3><p>It’s the eternal debate about cloud and high availability, legacy enterprise applications and chaos monkeys. <a href=\"http://blog.hendrikvolkmer.de/\">Hendrik Volkmer</a> shares his thoughts, summarised in “Stop wasting your time trying to find one”. His suggestion: With all that free time, start to build reliable systems on top of unreliable clouds.</p><h3><a href=\"http://fnords.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/grizzly-the-day-after/\">Grizzly, the day after</a></h3><p>Thierry’s, our fine release manager, wrote his therapeutic post-release essay, balancing the excitement of the new release and the sadness of all the things that could have done better.

This release, more than any before it, was driven by users who have been running OpenStack in production for the past year (or more) and have asked for broader support for the compute, storage, and networking technologies they trust and even greater scale and ease of operations. <a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/blog/2013/04/openstack-grizzly/\">Mark Collier&#8217;s</a> post has a summary of the new features and a screencast of the updated OpenStack Dashboard.</p><h4><a href=\"http://blog.aaronorosen.com/building-a-multi-tier-application-with-openstack/\">Building a Multi-Tier Application With OpenStack</a></h4><p>In his blog post <a href=\"http://blog.aaronorosen.com/\">Aaron Rosen</a> shows how to build a simple multi-tier application on OpenStack, something that is made possible by the new features of OpenStack Grizzly: security groups and about Load-balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS).</p><h3><a href=\"http://technicae.cogitat.io/2013/04/autoscale-and-orchestration-heat-of.html\">Autoscale and Orchestration: the Heat of OpenStack</a></h3><p>Duncan McGreggor tells the story of how OpenStack orchestration service (codename Heat) is gaining new autoscaling features thanks to increased efforts by Rackspace. Following discussions at Pycon, Rackspace&#8217;s management decided to add two development teams to Heat and add some of the features that initially they were developing internally. Another good story of different companies collaborating inside the OpenStack Community.</p><h3><a href=\"http://blog.hendrikvolkmer.de/2013/04/03/there-will-be-no-reliable-cloud-part-1/\">There will be no reliable cloud (part 1)</a></h3><p>It&#8217;s the eternal debate about cloud and high availability, legacy enterprise applications and chaos monkeys. <a href=\"http://blog.hendrikvolkmer.de/\">Hendrik Volkmer</a> shares his thoughts, summarised in “Stop wasting your time trying to find one”. His suggestion: With all that free time, start to build reliable systems on top of unreliable clouds.</p><h3><a href=\"http://fnords.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/grizzly-the-day-after/\">Grizzly, the day after</a></h3><p>Thierry&#8217;s, our fine release manager, wrote his therapeutic post-release essay, balancing the excitement of the new release and the sadness of all the things that could have done better.

In #openstack-101 <a href=\"http://vmartinezdelacruz.com/\">Victoria Martínez de la Cruz</a> met many people wanting to start contributing to OpenStack, but a lot of them didn’t know how to provide the right information to see where the problem was when they were facing a blocker.

The NIC (and the network in general) is always thought of as a consumable resource involved in a data transfer. To a lesser extent the disk bandwidth is considered, and on occasion the system bus is as well. However, the effects on the CPU tend to be underestimated.

To submit a presentation, visit the OpenStack Miniconf CFP site at <a href=\"http://aptira.wufoo.com/forms/pyconau2013-openstack-miniconf-call-for-presenters/\">http://aptira.wufoo.com/forms/pyconau2013-openstack-miniconf-call-for-presenters/</a></p><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2><ul><li>By <a href=\"http://anteaya.info/\">Anita Kuno</a>: <a href=\"http://anteaya.info/blog/2013/03/21/reviewing-an-openstack-patch/\">Reviewing an OpenStack Patch</a></li><li>By <a href=\"http://adam.younglogic.com/\">Adam Young</a>: <a href=\"http://adam.younglogic.com/2013/03/trusts-rbac/\">Trusts and Role Based Access Control for Open Stack</a></li><li>By <a href=\"http://blogs.citrix.com/\">Mate Lakat</a>: <a href=\"http://blogs.citrix.com/2013/03/18/virtual-hypervisor/\">Virtual Hypervisor: how to deploy XenServer inside a XenServer</a></li><li>By <a href=\"http://sebastien-han.fr/\">Sébastien Han</a>: <a href=\"http://sebastien-han.fr/blog/2013/03/18/grizzly-availability-zones/\">Grizzly availability zones</a></li><li>By <a href=\"http://cloudystuffhappens.blogspot.com/search/label/openstack\">Yun Mao</a>: <em><a href=\"http://cloudystuffhappens.blogspot.com/2013/03/zookeeper-and-openstack-nova.html\">How to use the ZooKeeper driver for ServiceGroup in OpenStack Nova</a></em></li><li>By <a href=\"http://kashyapc.wordpress.com/\">Kashyap Chamarthy</a>: <a href=\"http://kashyapc.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/openstack-nova-image-create-under-the-hood/\">OpenStack — nova image-create, under the hood</a></li></ul><h2>Security Advisories</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-March/000085.html\">OSSA 2013-007] Backend credentials leak in Glance v1 API (CVE-2013-1840) </a></li><li><a href=\"http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-March/000086.html\">OSSA 2013-008] Nova DoS by allocating all Fixed IPs (CVE-2013-1838) </a></li><li><a href=\"http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-March/000087.html\">[OSSA 2013-009] Keystone PKI tokens online validation bypasses revocation check (CVE-2013-1865) </a></li></ul><h2>Upcoming Events</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Hungary-Meetup-Group/events/109973362/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack Hungary Meeting</a> Mar 25, 2013 &#8211;
