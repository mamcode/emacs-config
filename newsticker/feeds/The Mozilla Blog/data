We believe in the importance of balancing the commercial goals of the Internet against those for the public benefit. Brazil’s Internet Bill of Rights, the Marco Civil da Internet, seeks to maintain this balance by guaranteeing basic rights for Internet users.  We support this kind of effort to create a comprehensive, pro-Internet policy framework. If adopted, it could well serve as a reference model for future legislation.</p><p>The legislation is groundbreaking in its intent. It secures important rights to Internet users through a civil framework rather than a criminal code. These rights include the right to privacy, freedom of speech, and access to information. It defends communications over the Internet, protects the sanctity of the Internet connection itself, requires comprehensive information in service contracts (particularly with respect to the protection of personal data), and limits third party access to connection logs and Internet applications.</p><p>The Marco Civil has been percolating since 2009. Despite a high level of community engagement (a collaboration of over eight hundred contributors), the legislation stagnated when commercial interests got involved. Important components of the legislation, such as the safe harbor provision regarding copyright infringement, have already been excluded.  We don’t want to see the legislation further diluted.</p><p>The Marco Civil mandates net neutrality while outlawing the tracking of consumers through deep packet inspection (DPI). These are two hot-button provisos opposed by certain commercial entities. The prohibition against DPI protects privacy and choice by outlawing its use to track unaware Internet users. The mandate of net neutrality contains very limited exceptions – and particularly prohibits businesses from charging for different types of services depending on what is contained in a data packet.</p><p>The drafters of the Marco Civil and other interested parties are hosting a <a href=\"http://direitorio.fgv.br/seminario-marco-civil-da-internet\" target=\"_blank\">seminar</a> in Brasilia on April 17. This Internet Bill of Rights sets valuable precedent for not only global net neutrality and privacy principles, but for the protection of intellectual property rights everywhere.</p><p>For more on the Marco Civil, see <a href=\"http://marcocivil.com.br/en/marco-civil-threatened/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Civil_da_Internet\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>

At <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/research/\">Mozilla Research</a>, we’re supporting this mission by experimenting with what’s next when it comes to the core technology powering the Web browser. We need to be prepared to take advantage of tomorrow’s faster, multi-core, heterogeneous computing architectures. That’s why we’ve recently begun collaborating with Samsung on an advanced technology Web browser engine called Servo.</p><p>Servo is an attempt to rebuild the Web browser from the ground up on modern hardware, rethinking old assumptions along the way. This means addressing the causes of security vulnerabilities while designing a platform that can fully utilize the performance of tomorrow’s massively parallel hardware to enable new and richer experiences on the Web. To those ends, Servo is written in Rust, a new, safe systems language developed by Mozilla along with a growing community of enthusiasts.</p><p>We are now pleased to announce with Samsung that together we are bringing both the <a href=\"http://www.rust-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust programming language</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo\" target=\"_blank\">Servo</a>, the experimental web browser engine, to Android and ARM. This is an exciting step in the evolution of both projects that will allow us to start deeper research with Servo on mobile. Samsung has already contributed an ARM backend to Rust and the build infrastructure necessary to cross-compile to Android, along with many other improvements. You can try this now by <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-building-for-android\" target=\"_blank\">downloading the code from Github</a>, but it’s just the beginning.</p><p>Rust, which <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-releases\">today reached v0.6</a>, has been in development for several years and is rapidly approaching stability. It is intended to fill many of the same niches that C++ has over the past decades, with efficient high-level, multi-paradigm abstractions, and offers precise control over hardware resources. But beyond that, it is *safe by default*, preventing entire classes of memory management errors that lead to crashes and security vulnerabilities. Rust also features lightweight concurrency primitives that make it easy for programmers to leverage the power of the many CPU cores available on current and future computing platforms.</p><p>In the coming year, we are racing to complete the first major revision of Rust &#8211; cleaning up, expanding and documenting the libraries, building out our tools to improve the user experience, and beefing up performance. At the same time, we will be putting more resources into Servo, trying to prove that we can build a fast web browser with pervasive parallelism, and in a safe, fun language. We, along with our friends at Samsung will be increasingly looking at opportunities on mobile platforms. Both of these efforts are still early stage projects and there’s a lot to do yet, so now is a good time to get involved.</p><p>To take a look at what we’re doing and contribute to the projects you can download and try the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-releases\">recently-released Rust 0.6</a> or check out the source for <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rust\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/servo\" target=\"_blank\">Servo</a> on GitHub.

Why is it important? These days, we all <strong>learn things in a wide variety of ways</strong>, but there are few opportunities to <strong>gain formal recognition for these skills</strong>. Traditional certifications, like degrees and diplomas, still lack the granularity to show the skills people have — like writing skills for an engineer, or project management for someone with an arts degree.</p><p>Not only that, but there&#8217;s no way to<strong> take all those skills and show them off in one place</strong>, regardless of where you&#8217;ve earned them. <strong>Open Badges changes that</strong>. It takes digital badges to a new level and makes them more powerful, networked and credible.</p><p><strong>More than <a href=\"http://openbadges.org/community/\">600 leading organizations</a> are now using Open Badges</strong> to issue badges that count toward education, careers and lifelong learning. Together we believe this can shape the future of learning, and help unlock the full educational potential of the web.</p><div id=\"attachment_7477\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 419px\"><a href=\"http://openmatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Girl-Scouts-building-apps-P6192718-Girls-Building-App-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-7477 \" alt=\" \" src=\"http://openmatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Girl-Scouts-building-apps-P6192718-Girls-Building-App-1-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"409\" height=\"307\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Girl Scouts can now earn digital badges for building apps as part of the &#8220;My Sash is an App&#8221; project</p></div><p>&#8220;We often talk about finding ways to make learning more accessible to more people,&#8221; says <strong>Erin Knight</strong>, Mozilla&#8217;s Senior Director of Learning and Badges. &#8220;Open Badges has the power to make that happen.

Telstra is welcoming the Mozilla initiative as an opportunity to deliver an innovative mobile Web experience to their customers. The breadth of operators now backing Mozilla’s Firefox OS demonstrates significant industry support for a fully-adaptable, unconstrained mobile platform.The first wave of Firefox OS devices will be available to consumers in Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Mexico, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Venezuela. Additional markets will be announced soon.</p><p>We are working with manufacturers Alcatel (TCL), Huawei, LG and ZTE to build the first Firefox OS devices, all powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon™ chipset.</p><p><strong>Firefox OS</strong><br />
Firefox OS offers the performance, personalization and price you want in a smartphone and a beautiful, clean, intuitive, personalized and easy-to-use experience.  Firefox OS includes all the things people need from a smartphone out of the box – calls, messaging, email, camera and more – as well as the things you wish a smartphone offered, like built-in cost controls, social features with Facebook and Twitter, location-based services, the Firefox Web browser, new ability to discover one-time use and downloadable apps, Firefox Marketplace and much more.</p><p>Firefox OS offers a deep contextual search that will take you to the exact content you want instead of just generic apps in the same category. It will allow far more sophisticated and deeper search capabilities as you can search both within apps and on the Web at the same time, which is not possible with native apps. For example, search for your favorite music artist and get results to buy your favorite song, concert tickets or even listen to your favorite song instantly.</p><p>With Firefox OS, you can simply enter any search term and instantly create a one-time use or downloadable app. Creating and consuming these apps on demand puts you in complete control of your app and smartphone experience and will make it possible for you to get the exact content you want, when you want it.</p><p>Firefox OS is an extension of the Firefox experience you know and love so you can expect all the security, privacy, customization and user control Firefox has always delivered.</p><p><strong>Firefox Marketplace</strong><br />
Firefox Marketplace will offer apps in categories like games, news and media, business and productivity. These apps are tied to you and your online identity to take across devices and platforms. Leading mobile apps and Web developers around the globe will leverage the power of the Web unlocked by Mozilla to release apps in the Firefox Marketplace.</p><p>The Web enables limitless innovation and with Firefox Marketplace. Every Web developer can easily create and distribute HTML5 apps so you can find an app for whatever you want – even local, niche and emerging topics. Firefox Marketplace will include popular apps such as AccuWeather, Airbnb, Box, Cut the Rope, Disney Mobile Games, EA games, Facebook, Nokia HERE, MTV Brasil, Pulse News, SoundCloud, SporTV, Terra, Time Out and Twitter as well as personally-tailored and local apps that are relevant to users in their respective regions.</p><p>Most mobile apps are built with Web technologies at the core and then wrapped in a proprietary technology to distribute the app on a specific platform. Mozilla is unlocking the Web as a mobile development platform with Firefox Marketplace and unwrapping mobile apps to enable more opportunity and control for developers and consumers.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace will make smartphones capable of offering more powerful and immersive Web app experiences. The Web now has the potential to be the world’s largest marketplace with the new Web APIs Mozilla developed. The open Web platform and these new Web APIs also enable developers to distribute apps directly, with no need for gatekeepers, true to the Mozilla mission of creating choice, innovation and opportunity on the Web.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace can be previewed on Firefox for Android Aurora and will be offered with the first Firefox OS phones to launch later this year.</p><p>We are very excited to bring Firefox OS to the world and delivering the Firefox OS experience through Open Web Devices later this year.</p><p>For more information:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/jay-sullivan-mwc/\">Watch Jay Sullivan&#8217;s MWC Press Conference Demo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/mwc\">Mozilla at Mobile World Congress Website</a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/firefox-os-expansion \">Mozilla Announces Global Expansion for Firefox OS </a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/Firefox-Marketplac\">Firefox OS Enables App Discovery without Download and Firefox Marketplace Unlocks the Power of Web Apps on Mobile Phones </a></li></ul>

Additional markets will be announced soon.</p><p>We are working with manufacturers Alcatel (TCL), Huawei, LG and ZTE to build the first Firefox OS devices, all powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon™ chipset.</p><p><strong>Firefox OS</strong><br />
Firefox OS offers the performance, personalization and price you want in a smartphone and a beautiful, clean, intuitive, personalized and easy-to-use experience.  Firefox OS includes all the things people need from a smartphone out of the box – calls, messaging, email, camera and more – as well as the things you wish a smartphone offered, like built-in cost controls, social features with Facebook and Twitter, location-based services, the Firefox Web browser, new ability to discover one-time use and downloadable apps, Firefox Marketplace and much more.</p><p>Firefox OS offers a deep contextual search that will take you to the exact content you want instead of just generic apps in the same category. It will allow far more sophisticated and deeper search capabilities as you can search both within apps and on the Web at the same time, which is not possible with native apps. For example, search for your favorite music artist and get results to buy your favorite song, concert tickets or even listen to your favorite song instantly.</p><p>With Firefox OS, you can simply enter any search term and instantly create a one-time use or downloadable app. Creating and consuming these apps on demand puts you in complete control of your app and smartphone experience and will make it possible for you to get the exact content you want, when you want it.</p><p>Firefox OS is an extension of the Firefox experience you know and love so you can expect all the security, privacy, customization and user control Firefox has always delivered.</p><p><strong>Firefox Marketplace</strong><br />
Firefox Marketplace will offer apps in categories like games, news and media, business and productivity. These apps are tied to you and your online identity to take across devices and platforms. Leading mobile apps and Web developers around the globe will leverage the power of the Web unlocked by Mozilla to release apps in the Firefox Marketplace.</p><p>The Web enables limitless innovation and with Firefox Marketplace. Every Web developer can easily create and distribute HTML5 apps so you can find an app for whatever you want – even local, niche and emerging topics. Firefox Marketplace will include popular apps such as AccuWeather, Airbnb, Box, Cut the Rope, Disney Mobile Games, EA games, Facebook, Nokia HERE, MTV Brasil, Pulse News, SoundCloud, SporTV, Terra, Time Out and Twitter as well as personally-tailored and local apps that are relevant to users in their respective regions.</p><p>Most mobile apps are built with Web technologies at the core and then wrapped in a proprietary technology to distribute the app on a specific platform. Mozilla is unlocking the Web as a mobile development platform with Firefox Marketplace and unwrapping mobile apps to enable more opportunity and control for developers and consumers.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace will make smartphones capable of offering more powerful and immersive Web app experiences. The Web now has the potential to be the world’s largest marketplace with the new Web APIs Mozilla developed. The open Web platform and these new Web APIs also enable developers to distribute apps directly, with no need for gatekeepers, true to the Mozilla mission of creating choice, innovation and opportunity on the Web.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace can be previewed on Firefox for Android Aurora and will be offered with the first Firefox OS phones to launch later this year.</p><p>We are very excited to bring Firefox OS to the world and delivering the Firefox OS experience through Open Web Devices later this year.</p><p>For more information:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/jay-sullivan-mwc/\">Watch Jay Sullivan’s MWC Press Conference Demo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/mwc\">Mozilla at Mobile World Congress Website</a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/firefox-os-expansion \">Mozilla Announces Global Expansion for Firefox OS </a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/Firefox-Marketplac\">Firefox OS Enables App Discovery without Download and Firefox Marketplace Unlocks the Power of Web Apps on Mobile Phones </a></li></ul>" "http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/02/24/mozilla-unlocks-the-power-of-the-web-on-mobile-with-firefox-os/" (20778 18931) new 10 nil nil ((title nil "Mozilla Unlocks the Power of the Web on Mobile with Firefox OS") (link nil "http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/02/24/mozilla-unlocks-the-power-of-the-web-on-mobile-with-firefox-os/") (comments nil "http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/02/24/mozilla-unlocks-the-power-of-the-web-on-mobile-with-firefox-os/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sun, 24 Feb 2013 17:12:19 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Mozilla") (category nil "About Mozilla") (category nil "Around the Web") (category nil "Firefox") (category nil "Firefox for mobile") (category nil "Mozilla Community") (category nil "Mozilla News") (category nil "Press Releases") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Firefox OS offers the performance, personalization and price you want in a smartphone and a beautiful, clean, intuitive, personalized and easy-to-use experience.  Firefox OS includes all the things people need from a smartphone out of the box – calls, messaging, email, camera and more – as well as the things you wish a smartphone offered, like built-in cost controls, social features with Facebook and Twitter, location-based services, the Firefox Web browser, new ability to discover one-time use and downloadable apps, Firefox Marketplace and much more.</p><p>Firefox OS offers a deep contextual search that will take you to the exact content you want instead of just generic apps in the same category. It will allow far more sophisticated and deeper search capabilities as you can search both within apps and on the Web at the same time, which is not possible with native apps. For example, search for your favorite music artist and get results to buy your favorite song, concert tickets or even listen to your favorite song instantly.</p><p>With Firefox OS, you can simply enter any search term and instantly create a one-time use or downloadable app. Creating and consuming these apps on demand puts you in complete control of your app and smartphone experience and will make it possible for you to get the exact content you want, when you want it.</p><p>Firefox OS is an extension of the Firefox experience you know and love so you can expect all the security, privacy, customization and user control Firefox has always delivered.</p><p><strong>Firefox Marketplace</strong><br />
Firefox Marketplace will offer apps in categories like games, news and media, business and productivity. These apps are tied to you and your online identity to take across devices and platforms. Leading mobile apps and Web developers around the globe will leverage the power of the Web unlocked by Mozilla to release apps in the Firefox Marketplace.</p><p>The Web enables limitless innovation and with Firefox Marketplace. Every Web developer can easily create and distribute HTML5 apps so you can find an app for whatever you want – even local, niche and emerging topics. Firefox Marketplace will include popular apps such as AccuWeather, Airbnb, Box, Cut the Rope, Disney Mobile Games, EA games, Facebook, Nokia HERE, MTV Brasil, Pulse News, SoundCloud, SporTV, Terra, Time Out and Twitter as well as personally-tailored and local apps that are relevant to users in their respective regions.</p><p>Most mobile apps are built with Web technologies at the core and then wrapped in a proprietary technology to distribute the app on a specific platform. Mozilla is unlocking the Web as a mobile development platform with Firefox Marketplace and unwrapping mobile apps to enable more opportunity and control for developers and consumers.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace will make smartphones capable of offering more powerful and immersive Web app experiences. The Web now has the potential to be the world’s largest marketplace with the new Web APIs Mozilla developed. The open Web platform and these new Web APIs also enable developers to distribute apps directly, with no need for gatekeepers, true to the Mozilla mission of creating choice, innovation and opportunity on the Web.</p><p>Firefox Marketplace can be previewed on Firefox for Android Aurora and will be offered with the first Firefox OS phones to launch later this year.</p><p>We are very excited to bring Firefox OS to the world and delivering the Firefox OS experience through Open Web Devices later this year.</p><p>For more information:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/jay-sullivan-mwc/\">Watch Jay Sullivan&#8217;s MWC Press Conference Demo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/mwc\">Mozilla at Mobile World Congress Website</a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/firefox-os-expansion \">Mozilla Announces Global Expansion for Firefox OS </a></li><li>Press Release: <a href=\"http://blog.mozilla.org/press/2013/02/Firefox-Marketplac\">Firefox OS Enables App Discovery without Download and Firefox Marketplace Unlocks the Power of Web Apps on Mobile Phones </a></li></ul>
