The front-end is communicating with the back-end via a JSON API.</p><p>I’ve come to the realization that this much <b>client-side processing and decoupling is detrimental to both the speed of development, and application performance</b> (a ton of JavaScript has to be loaded and evaluated each time you fire up the app). It’s better to let the server handle HTML rendering and minimize the use of JavaScript on the client. <b>You can still have fast and highly interactive applications</b>, as the new Basecamp shows—<b>letting the server handle most stuff doesn’t mean that you have to cut back on cool front-end features</b> and user friendliness.</p><p>I argue that all <b>these newfangled libraries are actually detrimental to the user experience</b> in some ways, as <b>they lock you into certain patterns</b> (it’s hard do to things the authors didn’t anticipate) and if you use something like Ember (which we didn’t), it’s even worse as all applications using it practically look the same (many people choose using Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap library, for example).</p><p>We’ve spend a lot of time getting Backbone to work properly, and <b>the ease-of-use quickly deteriorates when your models get more complex</b>. It’s a great choice for simple stuff, but email is far from simple. We also had to add yet an other extra layer of processing to generate “ViewModels” on the server because the normal Rails serialization of objects wouldn’t cut it.</p><p><b>What you end up with is building a layer cake that doesn’t add any value and slows down development.</b> Especially when you’re starting out and need to stay flexible you don’t want to have too much code around—and Rails is great for that, but… adding a JSON API layer and basically a second application that runs on the client is annihilating this advantage for you.</p><p>All in all, my current recommendation for SaaS-type web apps is: Rails 2.3 (or Rails 3.2 if you prefer), a Postgres database, as much HTML generation on the server as possible and augment that with <a href=\"http://slash7.com/2006/10/08/rjs-demistified-with-pretty-colors/\">RJS</a> (Rails’ mechanism to push JavaScript snippets to the client that get eval’d). This allows for <b>direct re-use of server-side templates</b>, and <b>it’s simple, and works well</b>. As an added bonus, keeping things on the server allow for much better error and performance monitoring and thus quicker turnaround for fixes. There’s also a lot of great stuff in this direction coming up in Rails 4 (like Turbolinks, a sort-of-successor to PJAX, which is a handy replacement for RJS if you don&#8217;t like it).</p><p><b>Alas, keep it simple and don’t repeat yourself.</b></p>

On mobile devices (phones and tablets), users use their finger instead, and there&#8217;s no more way to just hover over an element on a webpage—hovering and &#8220;clicking&#8221; are invoked by the same action: tapping.</p><p>Mobile browsers solve this issue by having the first tap invoking the hover style of an element and, if applicable, the second tap invoking any &#8220;click&#8221; events. Because of the need to discern swipes and taps, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons?hl=de-DE\">noticeable delay</a> in browser response time. What this adds up to is that when you have both a <code>:hover</code> style and a <code>onclick</code> event on, say, a contained button in the <code>:hover</code> area, users end up spending the better part of a second trying to invoke the &#8220;click&#8221; on the button (300ms for the hover tap, 300ms for the click tap, and extra time for lifting the finger in-between).</p><p>The easiest way to deal with this is simple: don&#8217;t use <code>:hover</code> on touch-enabled devices.</p><p>Here&#8217;s one way I solved this in <a href=\"http://letsfreckle.com\">Freckle Time Tracking</a>:</p><ol><li>I use <a href=\"https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blob/master/src/detect.js\">Zepto&#8217;s detect module</a> to see if I&#8217;m on a tablet or phone (you can use this module independently of Zepto, it doesn&#8217;t have dependencies on it).</li><li>If it&#8217;s a tablet or phone, I add a &#8220;no-hover&#8221; CSS class to the <code>BODY</code> element</li><li>I disable any <code>:hover</code> styles with selectors that use <code>body.no-hover ...</code>. You actually don&#8217;t have to redefine the <code>:hover</code> rule, just make sure the normal rule and the <code>:hover</code> rule contain the same CSS property settings (like <code>visibility:visible</code>)</li></ol><p>Now, my reason for not feature-testing (sue me!) for support of touch events and instead using browser sniffing is that 1) historically detection of touch events has been unreliable, 2) there are hybrid browsers and devices that support both touch and normal mouse events, and 3) it&#8217;s faster.</p><p><b>Update Jan 26, 7:50pm ET:</b> Here are two more variants on this, the first one is from <a href=\"http://www.vandervossen.net\">Thijs van der Vossen</a>, and is <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/4642897\">a short JavaScript snippet</a> that you can inline in your <code>HEAD</code> element. It adds multiple classes to <code>HTML</code>, depending on the environment it&#8217;s run in. The second variation is a <a href=\"https://github.com/mislav/movieapp/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/touch_nohover.coffee\">CoffeeScript function to automatically remove :hover rules</a> from <a href=\"http://mislav.uniqpath.com\">Mislav Marohnić</a> (assumes a modern, properly DOM-compatible browser).</p>

"http://mir.aculo.us/2012/10/20/5-rules-to-sell-thousands-of-copies-of-your-ebook/")) "<p>Wondering what your &#8220;hourly rate&#8221; is when you go out and write a technical book? Traditionally, publishers will tell you that you do it for &#8220;exposure&#8221; but we all know that you can die from that. Seriously, even for the publisher it&#8217;s a big gamble, and with all the extra costs for printing, marketing, publishing, whole-sale prices, etc. there will be nothing left over for you. And &#8220;exposure&#8221; will not pay the bills.</p><p><b>There&#8217;s a much better approach: self-publishing and learning the basics of marketing</b> to sell your book to the right audience. As an added bonus, you&#8217;ll know each and everyone of your readers and can build a strong relationship with them—which is awesome for you as you can fine-tune your book to reader&#8217;s needs and for your readers because they feel there&#8217;s an actual human being there listening to them.</p><p>To achieve this, you have to keep your costs low and your profit margin high. It&#8217;s no good to sell many copies with almost no profit, as the market for highly specialized books is limited.</p><p>Here&#8217;s my 5 rules to go for:</p><ul><li>(Rule #0: Have great content that is relevant to your target audience. That goes without saying!)</li><li><b>Rule #1: No publishers.</b> Publish the book yourself.</li><li><b>Rule #2: No 3rd-party sales channels.</b> No Amazon/Kindle, iBookstore, etc.</li><li><b>Rule #3: No DRM.</b> DRM has never stopped anyone from pirating stuff.</li><li><b>Rule #4: Publish as a PDF.</b> Optionally also as EPUB, depending on topic/audience. No dead-tree version, please.</li><li><b>Rule #5: Price high.</b> Price for the value you provide, not for what feels right.</li></ul><p>No publishers obviously cuts out the middleman. Of course, <b>you&#8217;ll have to learn how to market your book</b>—you can&#8217;t just sit there and wait for people to come. You might say, <em>&#8220;But Thomas, you have a billion followers on the interwebs, your stuff sells by itself!&#8221;</em>—I&#8217;m hearing this all the time, but being <em>&#8220;internet famous&#8221;</em> (in a very small circle) isn&#8217;t going to sell your book. I have to work on getting the marketing right just as hard as anyone else does.</p><p>For ebooks like this, <b>email lists work well</b>. For people to trust their email address to a stranger (you), you&#8217;ll need to give them something useful in return—for example, a coupon code to get the book cheaper, free chapters or weekly tips and tricks. Email marketing done right is a bit of work, but it will pay for itself. And if you don&#8217;t market, you won&#8217;t sell. Additional things you should do is try to land interviews and guest blog posts on blogs relevant to your topic.</p><p>For Retinafy, I&#8217;ve built initial interest by giving away a Retinafying flowchart for free (the flowchart was downloaded almost 100,000 times), and I sent out approximately weekly emails to the list of people that signed up to be informed about the book, each with a little tidbit and reason why retinafying is important and necessary, why the book will make it super easy, and a quote from a reader (collect those!).</p><p>As for Rule #2—100% of the profits (after payment fees) will go to you. For some topics, 3rd-party sales channels work really well, but most highly specialized technical topics are not among those. (If you sell more than a 100 copies you&#8217;re selling more than most other self-publishing authors. But most of those authors fail to market right.)</p><p>Once you figure out the price (you need to set the price first, and remember to not base your price on what feels right, see #5), to be profitable and worth your time, you should calculate what you want your minimum hourly rate to be. For example, <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy</a> took me about 50 hours of research and writing, and maybe another 30 hours of marketing. <em>As of today, October 20 2012, I&#8217;ve sold 1088 copies, for a total sale amount of $22,393.</em> For PayPal, you can assume that you&#8217;ll end up paying 5% or so in fees, so <b>the profit so far is about $21,300</b>, give or take a few. This makes my <b>hourly rate when working on the book $266.25</b>, and this is only going to increase with more sales.</p><p>Incidentally, looking at the hourly rate tells you how many copies you should target for—if the rate you project is below a certain number, it&#8217;s simply not worth writing the book. My lifetime-copies-sold goal of this particular book is 3,000 copies (at the current rate of sales, without additional marketing, I&#8217;ll reach this in a year or two, with an additional $50,000 coming in). For comparison, <a href=\"http://javascriptrocks.com/performance\">JavaScript Performance Rocks!</a> a book <a href=\"http://unicornfree.com/\">Amy</a> and I wrote in 2008, sold a total of 2686 copies so far, for a total amount of $79,964.96. (This is doesn&#8217;t include some site licenses we sold as well).</p><p><b>No DRM</b> (rule #3) is a no-brainer. It makes it harder for you and for your readers, breaks things, is ugly and most importantly never stopped anyone from pirating. Don&#8217;t bother.</p><p>Now as for rule #4, depending on your audience and book topic, <b>just a PDF is enough</b>. For example, I sell Retinafy.me only as a PDF. Now some people will give you flak about that, but the book has a lot of illustrations, screenshots and tables that can&#8217;t be formatted in any sane way (meaning not weeks of work) with EPUB, so I choose to have a PDF only. If it&#8217;s not a book about design and UI issues in particular, you&#8217;ll probably want to publish as an EPUB. (I&#8217;ll try to write about the toolchain I use in an upcoming blogpost.)</p><p>And we come to the last, and probably most important rule, <b>price high</b>. Your readers get value out of your book. If someone works for an hourly rate of say $100, reading my <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy</a> ebook will save them perhaps a full week of research, trying to read through blog posts, compiling information, running tests, trying things cross-browser, and so on. That&#8217;s $4000 spent on a book that costs $29. That&#8217;s less than 1% of the money you lose if you&#8217;d research it all yourself (and I&#8217;m an expert on this topic, so it will probably take you more than a week, and you wouldn&#8217;t be sure if you found the right answers). Never forget that your target audience is professionals. They spend money every day on things that are useful and provide value to them. $29 for an ebook that provides thousands of dollars in value to them is a no-brainer. (Heck, I should probably have priced it higher!)</p><p>Anyway, this how you can sell a book yourself, provide tremendous value to people—and make a tidy profit.</p><p>Oh, and now that you know how much money it will save you, grab a copy of <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy your web sites and apps</a>! <img src='http://mir.aculo.us/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4677051\">P.S.

We also had to add yet an other extra layer of processing to generate “ViewModels” on the server because the normal Rails serialization of objects wouldn’t cut it.</p><p><b>What you end up with is building a layer cake that doesn’t add any value and slows down development.</b> Especially when you’re starting out and need to stay flexible you don’t want to have too much code around—and Rails is great for that, but… adding a JSON API layer and basically a second application that runs on the client is annihilating this advantage for you.</p><p>All in all, my current recommendation for SaaS-type web apps is: Rails 2.3 (or Rails 3.2 if you prefer), a Postgres database, as much HTML generation on the server as possible and augment that with <a href=\"http://slash7.com/2006/10/08/rjs-demistified-with-pretty-colors/\">RJS</a> (Rails’ mechanism to push JavaScript snippets to the client that get eval’d). This allows for <b>direct re-use of server-side templates</b>, and <b>it’s simple, and works well</b>. As an added bonus, keeping things on the server allow for much better error and performance monitoring and thus quicker turnaround for fixes. There’s also a lot of great stuff in this direction coming up in Rails 4 (like Turbolinks, a sort-of-successor to PJAX, which is a handy replacement for RJS if you don&#8217;t like it).</p><p><b>Alas, keep it simple and don’t repeat yourself.</b></p>

Traditionally, publishers will tell you that you do it for “exposure” but we all know that you can die from that. Seriously, even for the publisher it’s a big gamble, and with all the extra costs for printing, marketing, publishing, whole-sale prices, etc. there will be nothing left over for you. And “exposure” will not pay the bills.</p><p><b>There’s a much better approach: self-publishing and learning the basics of marketing</b> to sell your book to the right audience. As an added bonus, you’ll know each and everyone of your readers and can build a strong relationship with them—which is awesome for you as you can fine-tune your book to reader’s needs and for your readers because they feel there’s an actual human being there listening to them.</p><p>To achieve this, you have to keep your costs low and your profit margin high. It’s no good to sell many copies with almost no profit, as the market for highly specialized books is limited.</p><p>Here’s my 5 rules to go for:</p><ul><li>(Rule #0: Have great content that is relevant to your target audience. That goes without saying!)</li><li><b>Rule #1: No publishers.</b> Publish the book yourself.</li><li><b>Rule #2: No 3rd-party sales channels.</b> No Amazon/Kindle, iBookstore, etc.</li><li><b>Rule #3: No DRM.</b> DRM has never stopped anyone from pirating stuff.</li><li><b>Rule #4: Publish as a PDF.</b> Optionally also as EPUB, depending on topic/audience. No dead-tree version, please.</li><li><b>Rule #5: Price high.</b> Price for the value you provide, not for what feels right.</li></ul><p>No publishers obviously cuts out the middleman. Of course, <b>you’ll have to learn how to market your book</b>—you can’t just sit there and wait for people to come. You might say, <em>“But Thomas, you have a billion followers on the interwebs, your stuff sells by itself!”</em>—I’m hearing this all the time, but being <em>“internet famous”</em> (in a very small circle) isn’t going to sell your book. I have to work on getting the marketing right just as hard as anyone else does.</p><p>For ebooks like this, <b>email lists work well</b>. For people to trust their email address to a stranger (you), you’ll need to give them something useful in return—for example, a coupon code to get the book cheaper, free chapters or weekly tips and tricks. Email marketing done right is a bit of work, but it will pay for itself. And if you don’t market, you won’t sell. Additional things you should do is try to land interviews and guest blog posts on blogs relevant to your topic.</p><p>For Retinafy, I’ve built initial interest by giving away a Retinafying flowchart for free (the flowchart was downloaded almost 100,000 times), and I sent out approximately weekly emails to the list of people that signed up to be informed about the book, each with a little tidbit and reason why retinafying is important and necessary, why the book will make it super easy, and a quote from a reader (collect those!).</p><p>As for Rule #2—100% of the profits (after payment fees) will go to you. For some topics, 3rd-party sales channels work really well, but most highly specialized technical topics are not among those. (If you sell more than a 100 copies you’re selling more than most other self-publishing authors. But most of those authors fail to market right.)</p><p>Once you figure out the price (you need to set the price first, and remember to not base your price on what feels right, see #5), to be profitable and worth your time, you should calculate what you want your minimum hourly rate to be. For example, <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy</a> took me about 50 hours of research and writing, and maybe another 30 hours of marketing. <em>As of today, October 20 2012, I’ve sold 1088 copies, for a total sale amount of $22,393.</em> For PayPal, you can assume that you’ll end up paying 5% or so in fees, so <b>the profit so far is about $21,300</b>, give or take a few. This makes my <b>hourly rate when working on the book $266.25</b>, and this is only going to increase with more sales.</p><p>Incidentally, looking at the hourly rate tells you how many copies you should target for—if the rate you project is below a certain number, it’s simply not worth writing the book. My lifetime-copies-sold goal of this particular book is 3,000 copies (at the current rate of sales, without additional marketing, I’ll reach this in a year or two, with an additional $50,000 coming in). For comparison, <a href=\"http://javascriptrocks.com/performance\">JavaScript Performance Rocks!</a> a book <a href=\"http://unicornfree.com/\">Amy</a> and I wrote in 2008, sold a total of 2686 copies so far, for a total amount of $79,964.96. (This is doesn’t include some site licenses we sold as well).</p><p><b>No DRM</b> (rule #3) is a no-brainer. It makes it harder for you and for your readers, breaks things, is ugly and most importantly never stopped anyone from pirating. Don’t bother.</p><p>Now as for rule #4, depending on your audience and book topic, <b>just a PDF is enough</b>. For example, I sell Retinafy.me only as a PDF. Now some people will give you flak about that, but the book has a lot of illustrations, screenshots and tables that can’t be formatted in any sane way (meaning not weeks of work) with EPUB, so I choose to have a PDF only. If it’s not a book about design and UI issues in particular, you’ll probably want to publish as an EPUB. (I’ll try to write about the toolchain I use in an upcoming blogpost.)</p><p>And we come to the last, and probably most important rule, <b>price high</b>. Your readers get value out of your book. If someone works for an hourly rate of say $100, reading my <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy</a> ebook will save them perhaps a full week of research, trying to read through blog posts, compiling information, running tests, trying things cross-browser, and so on. That’s $4000 spent on a book that costs $29. That’s less than 1% of the money you lose if you’d research it all yourself (and I’m an expert on this topic, so it will probably take you more than a week, and you wouldn’t be sure if you found the right answers). Never forget that your target audience is professionals. They spend money every day on things that are useful and provide value to them. $29 for an ebook that provides thousands of dollars in value to them is a no-brainer. (Heck, I should probably have priced it higher!)</p><p>Anyway, this how you can sell a book yourself, provide tremendous value to people—and make a tidy profit.</p><p>Oh, and now that you know how much money it will save you, grab a copy of <a href=\"http://retinafy.me\">Retinafy your web sites and apps</a>! <img src='http://mir.aculo.us/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4677051\">P.S.
