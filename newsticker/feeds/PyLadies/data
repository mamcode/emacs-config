<p><em>Thanks to Katie Cunningham of Tucson for letting us copy this post from <a href=\"http://katieirenec.blogspot.com/2013/03/computer-science-outreach-magic.html\">her blog</a>!</em></p>

<p>For several months, I always carried a deck of cards in my backpack. I like playing gin rummy as much as anyone, but that&#39;s not the reason why. I carried them because I had discovered <strong><em>Computer Science Outreach Magic</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I learned a Computer Science magic trick from <a href=\"http://cs4fn.org/magic\">cs4fn.org/magic</a>, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. I&#39;ve performed this trick to much success when manning booths at outreach events and teacher visiting days. It lets you engage people while illustrating a bit of computer science. At the PyLadies&#39; lunch at <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon &#39;13</a>, Esther Nam convinced me to write a blog post about this card trick I was so excited about. &quot;Lots of people want to know how to demonstrate computer science without a computer!&quot; she said.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QWERYs18cuw/UUWEUHD2leI/AAAAAAAAAEI/DNVDS_mvWNo/s400/cards1.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching the card trick to Computer Science student volunteers at the Tucson Festival of Books.\"></p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly why I love this trick. It&#39;s portable, it&#39;s easy, and it doesn&#39;t use a computer. It allows people to see an easily digestible example of the logic, discrete math, and information that is at the core of Computer Science. For people who aren&#39;t impressed by physical computers or cryptic terminal windows, this can really be a draw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Computer science] is not really about computers -- and it&#39;s not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes.... Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don&#39;t really understand it very well, it&#39;s very easy to confuse the essence of what you&#39;re doing with the tools that you use.&quot; - Hal Abelson (1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Here&#39;s how I do it:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You need <strong>three people</strong>: The magician, the assistant, and the learner.</p></li>
<li><p>The magician closes her eyes and <strong>keeps them closed until the end of the trick</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The learner is given the deck and told to <strong>make a four by four matrix of cards with some face up and some face down, randomly distributed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PaDicUidMdc/UVlR53gTf7I/AAAAAAAAAM4/6151cf6yKZE/s200/2013-03-31+13.36.14.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

<ul>
<li>The assistant takes the deck back and whispers to the learner: <strong>&quot;I&#39;m going to make it harder for her and add another row and column&quot;.</strong> The magician might groan at this point and say &quot;Nooo it&#39;s so hard already!!!&quot; The new row and column are added.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SjXhvfiM7ks/UVlR5KOW9oI/AAAAAAAAAM0/YnuzY62o7g4/s200/2013-03-31+13.37.51.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

<ul>
<li>The assistant tells the learner to flip one card, and that the magician will tell him which card he flipped. <strong>The learner flips one card.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rd8vxAd32pU/UVlR2EGsu5I/AAAAAAAAAMs/Ie0E7w2SL0k/s200/2013-03-31+13.39.49.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The magician opens her eyes, hovers her hands over the cards, and <strong>identifies the flipped card!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The learner is very impressed. While the amazement hasn&#39;t worn off, the magician and assistant tell the learner that <strong>this method is used to identify errors in computer data.</strong> Face up and face down cards are just like the way a computer stores information in 1s and 0s. Perhaps the information is being sent from one computer to another and one of the bits -- one of the 1s or 0s -- gets changed to the other (flipped!). Computer Scientists invented this technique so computers could discover where the error took place. If the learner is still interested, explain how the trick worked.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How does the trick work??!!??</h2>
<p>When the assistant adds the extra row and column, he is actually adding <strong>parity bits</strong>. For non-CS people, that means that the assistant adds another card to each row and column so <strong>the sum of face up cards in that row or column is now even</strong>. If there are an even number of face up cards in the row or column, the assistant adds a face down. If there are an odd number of face down cards in the row or column, he adds a face up.</p>

<p>The cards need to be put down seemingly without thought, like the assistant is just adding the extra row and column randomly. Here&#39;s a walkthrough:</p>

<p>Add a parity bit to the end of each of the columns</p>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-43G67TR9qx0/UVnMUg5xkeI/AAAAAAAAANM/wQSrpONYsrU/s320/paritied_with_row_merged.png\" alt=\"\"></p>

<p>Add a parity bit to all of the rows, including the row you just added. (Notice that the column you are adding has parity automatically.)</p>

<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f-glidmmt-k/UVnMYM6168I/AAAAAAAAANU/KLLIjMNfJis/s320/paritied_with_col_merged.png\" alt=\"\"></p>

<p>Now when the learner flips a card, the row and column of the card that was flipped have an odd number of face up cards! You can quickly find the flipped card, even though you&#39;ve never seen the grid before.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0PjjohEdhy0/UVnQyXP4lDI/AAAAAAAAANk/bXKXQWyY14U/s320/found_it.png\" alt=\"\"></p>

<p>It works just as well when the flipped card is in the parity row or column.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--5Vj10M2eoQ/UVnQz1T9AOI/AAAAAAAAANs/GY4dr0GOClI/s320/found_it_side.png\" alt=\"\"></p>

<p>The kids at the CSUnplugged show figured it out on their own, I was very impressed. The presenters used this trick as their opening act, and then explained it at the very end, so the kids had some time to think about it. If you want to see their explanation, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gBPZOpT4DPU\">this video</a></p>
<h2>Optional Follow-up</h2>
<p>Make sure the learner really understands by <strong>putting the cards back into their parity&#39;d state and asking him to close his eyes and guess which card his friend flipped</strong>. This is demoed in the video above. If you have more time for more than a quick wow moment, you can ask the learner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it matter if the error is in the parity bits?</li>
<li>Is it possible to detect two errors, and if so, can they be corrected?</li>
<li>How about three errors?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Practice!</h2>
<p>I&#39;m sure you are excited now to show this trick to all your friends. With this trick in your pocket, every person becomes someone you can impress with computer science! You&#39;ll live for the stunned look on people&#39;s faces when you pick the right card!</p>

<p>But to make it go smoothly, you&#39;ll need to <strong>practice practice practice practice</strong>! The trick might sound simple enough, but every time I or someone else has attempted the trick without recent practice, it has been a major fail.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dASy6SDRpKk/UVkf-MZPdTI/AAAAAAAAALk/pjaO4G3DPso/s200/2013-03-30+13.36.13.jpg\" alt=\"Practice with your cat! And people.\"></p>

<p>Practice with your cat! And people.</p>
<h2>Alternate versions</h2>
<p>I like doing this trick with cards because cards are easy to get my hands on when I&#39;m inspired to perform. Usually I have limited table space, so it&#39;s hard to squeeze in more cards than I have described. In the CSUnplugged version, they start with a larger grid and black and white squares. (Note that it doesn&#39;t matter how big your grid is -- the trick works the same.) They also had the nifty idea to make them magnetic so the trick can be performed on a whiteboard.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CfcakI791kE/UU3hycAFaQI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/C8VUDQ5swZU/s640/parity_trick.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

<p>CSUnplugged has the magician add the extra row, eliminating the assistant. I like having the assistant better, because the magician&#39;s reveal is more impressive, since clearly no memorization is done -- the magician hasn&#39;t seen the cards at all! Also, when a little kid is the learner, the assistant is necessary to make sure he or she puts down the cards correctly and flips only one card. But for a demonstration in front of a classroom or when you&#39;re alone, it&#39;s worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Find the original cs4fn version of the trick on page 25 here: <a href=\"http://www.cs4fn.org/magic/downloads/cs4fnmagicbook1.pdf\">http://www.cs4fn.org/magic/downloads/cs4fnmagicbook1.pdf</a>. They add the extra row based on face down cards instead of face up cards. It doesn&#39;t matter really of course -- do what&#39;s easier to see quickly. Or if you change the size of the grid to have an even number of rows and columns at the end of the trick, it doesn&#39;t matter! Face up and face down will both have to be even or odd.</p>

<p>P.s. Now that you are using this trick, you have to watch out for Magnita Makov, world&#39;s greatest magician.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck! Go forth and impress all your friends!!!</strong></p>

"html")) "<p>Rebase is a downright scary concept. When the best way to explain how it works I&#39;ve heard starts with thinking that you&#39;re time-traveling back to before certain changes were ever introduced to a project, you probably should be afraid. We&#39;ve all read enough science fiction to know what happens if you go back to the Age of the Dinosaurs and step on an ugly-looking bug.</p>

<p>But while rebase is a responsibility to take seriously - especially if you&#39;re working on a team and you could wipe out every commit people have added since last Sunday - perhaps we&#39;re in less danger from time travel paradoxes than I previously assumed.</p>
<h2>A Quick Example of Rebase</h2>
<p>Just so we all are on the same page, let&#39;s go through a quick example of how you might use rebase:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that you have a git repository with a file in it and that you&#39;ve branched that file and made some changes. Meanwhile, someone else has modified that same file on the master branch. In order to get everything put back together again, you may consider using git rebase. To do so, you would need to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ git rebase master
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s it. There might be some conflicts that you&#39;d need to go in and clean up if your co-coder has been up to some serious business since you&#39;ve last merged in your changes, but the command itself is simple. Now it looks like your changes started from the current master rather than from the original branch point.</p>

<p>If you want to now add your up-to-date changes back into the master, you&#39;ll still need to merge it in.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge branchname
</code></pre>
<p>How is this whole process different from just using git merge in the first place? It&#39;s just prettier: someone going through the code&#39;s history would see straight forward progress along the master branch.</p>
<h2>A Better Metaphor for Rebase</h2>
<p>Rebase is generally considered a slightly-nuclear option. It&#39;s possible to be careful about rebasing code, say by duplicating the master branch and rebasing your code on that new version to see if you accidentally destroy the world before trying to rebase within the actual master. Somehow, though, we still see it as something dangerous.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/index-en.html\"><img src=\"http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/rebase.svg\" align=\"right\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/></a></p>

<p>Perhaps a new metaphor may be more useful here. I&#39;m the type to go out and read a bunch about a particular command before I&#39;ll get comfortable with using it. I&#39;ve gone over <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing\">this section from ProGit</a> a couple of times and something finally became clear: when you rebase, you can reorder a whole bunch of different things!</p>

<p>For me, this is like sewing. When I was little, I would help my grandmother with her sewing projects. She grew up in the Great Depression and not one bit of material would ever go to waste in her sewing room. A piece of clothing didn&#39;t fit right? She&#39;d tailor it. A seam wound up in the wrong place? She&#39;d rip it out and go again. A project went horribly, horribly wrong? She&#39;d take it apart and put it together again in a different way.</p>

<p>Rebase is a seam ripper and a bowl full of pins, all in one. You&#39;ve got a bunch of concrete pieces of code that you&#39;ve committed over time and you can rip them apart with rebase. In the same action, you can pin them back together and run them through the sewing machine again. As a result, you&#39;re not just limited to what you might do with the master branch and whatever branch you&#39;ve been working on seperately. </p>

<p>Just like in sewing, though, there are some rules that you absolutely need to follow. The &quot;don&#39;t accidentally sew your fingers to the garment&quot; rule of rebasing is that <strong>you should never rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.</strong> It&#39;s not out of the question to fix such a problem (and there&#39;s probably less blood than the sewing machine-finger combo), but it requires some serious clean up.</p>
<h2>Measure Twice, Cut Once</h2>
<p>In fact, as long as you&#39;re taking proper precautions, it&#39;s possible to come back from most rebase screw ups (though this opinion is based on my own, admittedly limited, experience). The precautions seems a little tedious, just like measuring fabric twice and double-checking that you know what to do with your pattern can be. But that tedium can help you avoid big screw-ups, even if you never notice the accident you avoided.</p>

<p>The moment that I realized that rebase isn&#39;t so much a bomb as a seam ripper, it was a lot less worrying to type in that command and hit &#39;enter.&#39;</p>

<p>I started a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX/\">PyLadies chapter in Portland, OR</a> last September (2012). We started out with weekly meetings to do homework from a Coursera class to make games with Python. That turned into weekly meetings -- plus homework meetups on Saturdays at a local coffee shop, and IRC hangout time to test homework. And that turned into me giving mini-lessons at each Coursera meetup about the material from the class. People seemed really excited.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Stats-PyLadies-PDX-Portland-OR-Meetup-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"Stats - PyLadies PDX (Portland, OR) - Meetup\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" align=\"right\" /></p>

<p>Before we knew it, it was December, we had over 60 women subscribed to the Meetup, 30 of which had attended a meeting. Today, we&#39;ve got 85 subscribers, 50 people have attended a meeting, and more have signed up to attend events in the future than ever before. And, it&#39;s done by women. Using open source. Teaching classes. Learning developer tools. And writing software.</p>

<p>Since September, I&#39;ve met even more women involved in <a href=\"http://www.pyladies.com/locations/\">running PyLadies chapters</a> across the country. Much like the way the PostgreSQL community is organized, we&#39;ve got a loosely connected group of people working independently. We offer support to each other, but don&#39;t have hard and fast rules about what each chapter does. We encourage teaching and workshops, but don&#39;t require them. We share our resources and are quick to put git repos out there of our materials. We send lots of pull requests. And we&#39;re constantly looking for ways for women to get more involved in open source and Python.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://www.chesnok.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/All-Group-Reviews-PyLadies-PDX-Portland-OR-Meetup-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"All Group Reviews - PyLadies PDX (Portland, OR) - Meetup\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" align=\"right\"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m completely energized by the positive feedback we&#39;ve gotten for every meeting. More recently, I&#39;ve heard from people that they feel confident and sure of their knowledge because they&#39;ve spent time in our meetups talking and learning from other women.</p>

<p>My goal is to make every get together like that - by having great lessons, a shared understanding of coaching and peer-based education and presentations from our members. Building these groups takes time, and I&#39;m impatient to get to the part where I feel like every interaction with the group is rewarding for every member.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t do it alone. We&#39;ve got four meetup organizers (although one is about to relocate to the Bay Area!). I work closely with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/floraworley\">Flora Worley</a>, a kickass developer who chose programming as a career path after working on a PhD, on topic details and planning for the meetings. I&#39;m so looking forward to meeting in person with the many members of the PyLadies community at <a href=\"http://pycon.org\">PyCon</a> next month.</p>

<h2>Coming to DjangoCon in September? Let&#39;s have a chat about DC.</h2>
<p>by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kcunning\">Katie Cunningham</a> (with mad props to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jackiekazil\">Jackie Kazil</a>, who helped write this post!)</p>
<h3>The location</h3>
<p><a href=\"http://djangocon.us/\">DjangoCon DC</a> is actually in Northern Virginia, not in the heart of the Capitol. Specifically, it&#39;s being held in Crystal City at the Hyatt Regency, which is close to the Crystal City Metro Station (the yellow and blue metro lines) and one stop away from Reagan National Airport (DCA).</p>

<p>I worked in the area for many years, and while it doesn&#39;t have as much of the DC grit and history, it makes up for in being a great nexus between convenience and cost. As someone who&#39;s been to several conferences in DC, I can tell you this is a good thing. It is a safe, clean, affordable, and transportation-accessible part of the DC metro area that is littered with Django developers.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you aren&#39;t going to be staying at the conference&#39;s hotel, you&#39;re in luck. DC has a LOT of hotels. In general, the closer they are to a metro stop, the more expensive they are, but it&#39;s still possible to find no-frills hotels very close to a metro stop. If you want to remain close to the main action, I would get a hotel at L&#39;Enfant (which is close to the Mall), Crystal City, or National Airport. Franconia/Springfield may look convenient, but it&#39;s actually not close to anything.</p>
<h3>Getting to DC</h3><h4>Flying</h4>
<p><a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;aq=0&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Ronald+Reagan+Washington+National+Airport,+1+Aviation+Circle,+Arlington,+Virginia&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=211095113154214193828.0004af190da676086d76b&amp;sll=38.849312,-77.041175&amp;sspn=0.01738,0.032015&amp;t=m&amp;ll=39.155622,-77.025146&amp;spn=0.745426,1.167297&amp;z=9\">View DC airports in a larger map</a></p>

<p>There are three airports in the D.C. region. Travel sites like Hipmunk and Kayak try to make all our local airports equivalent, as if it&#39;s just a short jaunt from each to DC. This is a dirty, nasty lie.</p>

<p>The airport visible from the hotel is Reagan National. It is only one metro stop from the hotel (or just under a mile walk if you are crazy). The other airports, Dulles and BWI, are inconvenient but usually cheaper if you are on a budget and willing to spend an extra hour to two hours using a combination of shuttle services, Amtrak, buses, metro. If you choose to stomach one of the other options, then add about $15 to your trip. If you take a taxi, you could end up spending more than the cost of your savings.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re coming in on an international flight, it may be worth looking for a flight that lands at some other international airport like Atlanta or New York, then catch a flight into Reagan. Trust me, you will not regret this.</p>
<h4>Train</h4>
<p>The train station is located at Union Station. It can be nice way to travel if you are on the Eastern Seaboard. The commute from Union Station to the conference isn&#39;t bad, since Union Station is also a metro stop.</p>

<p>Chinatown buses and other bus services<br>
For those on a budget or looking for adventure and located on the Eastern Seaboard you might check look into the Chinatown buses. Various companies in Chinatown shuttle to Baltimore, Philideplia, New York, and Boston. D.C. to New York is between three and five hours (depending on your driver aherance to the speed limit) and costs around $20 each way. They will drop you off in Chinatown near the metro, which is the same metro line that you would need to get to the conference. Sometimes you can find a service that offers wifi and plugs and sometimes there are live animals and sketchy late night stops. Adventure!</p>

<p>Other buses services will drop you off in other parts, but they are usually close to a metro stop. Bolt Bus is probably one of the nicest.</p>
<h4>Driving</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t. It&#39;s not worth it unless you are car pooling. You won&#39;t need your car while visiting. If you do though, you can park you car at the Hotel (expect to pay a pretty hefty amount per night, though). If you want to bring your car, bring a GPS and some antacids. I&#39;ve been told we&#39;re pretty bad drivers around here.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>DC&#39;s metro is stupidly simple and is probably going to all the places you want to go. DC metro area cabs are priced pretty well as a back up. I wouldn&#39;t bother to rent a car.</p>

<p>However, if you want to rent a bike, I have good news! There&#39;s a <a href=\"http://revolutioncycles.com/about/city-hub-central-pg602.htm\">Revolution Cycles</a> in Crystal City that rents bikes by the week. I spoke with the owners, and they have about 100 bikes available. Given how many people are going to be in town, they recommended reserving one ahead of time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no bike enthusiast (I still think my green Huffy was pretty rad), but I have been informed by bike geeks that these are good bikes.</p>

<p>There is also <a href=\"http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/\">BikeShare</a>, which is like Zipcars for bikes, through DC and in the conference hotel neighbor. Bring your own helmet, though. Don&#39;t be one of those guys. But there are only 10 spots at the hotel, so don&#39;t count on easily finding a bike at the conference. This is a better option used to tool around D.C. for a couple hours.</p>

<p>At the moment, I don&#39;t have much information regarding bike parking at the hotel. Hotels in the region are starting to have bike parking sections available, but if you&#39;re renting a bike for the week, keep in mind that you might be keeping it in your room (I hope I&#39;m wrong).</p>

<p>More soon!<br>
I&#39;m going to post something about our tourist scene, if anyone is interested in seeing the sites while you&#39;re here.</p>

Maybe you’re just out of college and you are looking to sharpen your skills. Or maybe you want a break from building widgets and want to spend some time making things that really matter.</p>

<p>Sounds like a fantastic way for a few good (or even a whole lot of) Pythonistas to make a big difference in many citizens&#39; lives!</p>

<p>You&#39;d better hop to it, though - the deadline for applying to the Fellowship is this Friday, July 13th.  Email <a href=\"mailto:info@pyladies.com\">info@pyladies.com</a> if you have any questions and we&#39;ll direct you to the contact person for this opportunity.</p>

<p>I am really excited to announce our second keynote speaker for DjangoCon Europe 2012 - Jessica McKellar.</p>

<p>Jessica is a kernel engineer from Cambridge, Massachusetts. She&#39;s a maintainer of several open source Python projects, most notably Twisted and OpenHatch. She&#39;s also working on a new edition of Twisted Networking Essentials for O&#39;Reilly.</p>

<p>On top of her open source contributions, she is also a Python Software Foundation board member and a crucial part in the Boston Python User Group, the largest Python user group in the world. With that group she runs the Boston Python Workshop, an introductory programming pipeline that has brought hundreds of women into the local Python community and is being replicated in cities across the US.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of attending last night’s Girl Geek dinner at Yelp’s headquarters. The event was about empowering women by hearing their success stories.</p>

<p>Three of the speakers were not strangers to me, odd enough! Christine from PyLadies in LA spoke about increasing involvement of women in the Python community. And of course, spreading the Pyladies ingenuity to San Francisco with the help of yours truly!</p>

<p>Kaitlyn Trigger of lovestagram.com, a valentine overlay to instagram photos, spoke as well. I had the fortunate opportunity to invite her to one of my Women Who Code python workshop nights. I loved her message that one can not learn how to code by herself; it takes a village!</p>

<p>Lastly, Sasha of Women Who Code gave a great talk on how she starting the group, and her motivation behind it. Too bad she’s now in NYC :-/</p>

<p>I would highly recommend attending a Girl Geek dinner in the future!</p>

<p>​1. <strong>Don&#39;t be intimidated by intense topics or talks.</strong> Part of attending a conference is exposing yourself to new content and learning from it. If you don&#39;t get it all, you may be reminded of it years later when you come across something similar.</p>

<p>2.<strong>It&#39;s okay to walk out.</strong> If you aren&#39;t sure about a talk, it&#39;s *totally* okay to sit in the back and dip out if it&#39;s not what you expected or if you don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s going to be interesting or helpful to you.</p>

<p>​3. <strong>Do talk to people.</strong> One of the best things about conferences is meeting folks you enjoy or who challenge and inspire you. Don&#39;t fill your entire calendar with talks, spend some of the time just chatting with folks who are there and making new friends.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu\">USC&#39;s Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism</a> hosted a beginner&#39;s Python workshop that was even bigger than the first one we held back in May. 50-odd geeks, nerds, and similar fought their way through some unexpected downtown traffic to attend this tutorial, taught by PyLadies kjam, Sandy, and xtine.</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/1stprogram.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>

<p>It was a bright crowd, with most people Learning Python the Hard Way at a fairly rapid clip. They were impatient to learn about web scraping from kjam, and eager to follow along with the code samples presented at the end-of-day lightning talks.</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/amazon.png\" alt=\"image2\"></p>

<p>Photos from this event are up on our <a href=\"https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/sets/72157628083649345/\">Flickr page</a>! BIG thanks to Geneva Oh of USC Annenberg and Prof. <strong>Robert Hernandez</strong>for proposing, organizing and promoting this workshop for USC students and journalists (including one intrepid nerd-to-be who flew in from Arizona solely for this event!), as well as sponsoring the venue and food.</p>

<p>Lightning talks from</p>

<p><strong>xtine</strong>: scraping data from a music website for fun!</p>

<p><strong>Robin</strong>: <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/ListComps.ppt\">Python List Comprensions</a> [.ppt]</p>

<p>Most of the talks from DjangoCon will be available <a href=\"http://blip.tv/djangocon\">online</a> soon (we hope!) - lots of slides and other docs are available via <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/\">Lanyrd</a>. Here&#39;s a brief recap of how the PyLadies represented last week:</p>

<p>On Monday we labored through a pre-conference day of tutorials to help <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pydanny\">PyDanny</a> lead the Ultimate Django Tutorial, all proceeds from which went directly to the PyLadies. We had invaluable assistance from other great mentors like <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/\">DSF</a> president <a href=\"http://twitter.com/freakboy3742\">Russell Keith-Magee</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/gabrielmgrant\">Gabriel Grant</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dotcloud.com/\">DotCloud</a>, to name just two.</p>

<p><img src=\"https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6146290822_7c1bf5c590.jpg\" alt=\"image1\"></p>

<p>The conference began in earnest on Tuesday, with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/limedaring\">Tracy</a> delivering an inspiring <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/limedaring/from-designer-to-djangoer-in-six-weeks-a-story-from-solo-founder\">talk</a> about launching her own <a href=\"http://www.weddinginvitelove.com/\">startup</a> in six weeks by teaching herself Django. That afternoon, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/sandymahalo\">Sandy</a> wowed even the most experienced developers in the room with her excellent talk on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/pyladies.com/present/view?id=0AVthC0Z3iw8DZGRrdnFzeGdfN2c5bWJ6d2Y1&amp;hl=en_US\">best practices in testing</a>. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/audreyr\">Audrey</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/webdevgirl\">Christine</a> picked up the PyLadies baton the following day, with talks about <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/audreyr/django-package-thunderdome-by-audrey-roy-daniel-greenfeld\">Django packages</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/cosecant/best-practices-for-frontend-django-developers\">Django for the Front-End</a>, respectively. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kjam\">Katharine</a> spoke on Wednesday afternoon about <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19508576/djangocon_slides/src/scraper_talk.html\">web-scraping methods</a>.</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/6146295356_b7fe674122_b.jpg\" alt=\"image2\"></p>

<p>I&#39;m singling out the PyLadies-driven sessions specially here, but of course there were numerous other great technical talks on topics ranging from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/idangazit/dc2011-keynote%20to%20security\">design</a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/idangazit\">Idan Gazit</a>), to <a href=\"http://djangocon.us/schedule/presentations/52/\">security issues</a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/paulrmcmillan\">Paul McMillan</a>), to pouring out some good-natured haterade for  our favorite framework and language (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/glyph\">Glyph Lefkowitz&#39;s</a> memorable keynote was entitled: &quot;Why does Django Hate Python&quot;?).</p>

<p>Most of us were heavily sleep-deprived by Friday -- thank heaven for Stumptown Roasters and Voodoo Doughnuts! Still, inspired by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/holdenweb\">Steve Holden</a>&#39;s and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ubernostrum\">James Bennett</a>&#39;s respective talks about Django&#39;s <a href=\"http://t.co/E8VkaJM\">documentation</a>, a few PyLadies delegates got together with a number of other devs at <a href=\"http://urbanairship.com/\">Urban Airship</a> for code sprints, to try and rework the official <a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Tutorials\">Django tutorial</a> so that it would be more friendly to beginners and casual Djangologists. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/natea\">Nate Aune</a> started a <a href=\"https://github.com/natea/djangostarterkit\">git repo</a> for the project and we hope to continue to plug away at it even though the conference is over.  Still, while coding remotely has its pros, it was pretty awesome to be able to sit in the same room with dozens of talented folks to plug away at the same open-source project!</p>
<h2><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/sprints.png\" alt=\"image3\"></h2><h2><img src=\"https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6077/6145758885_aedbef599b.jpg\" alt=\"image4\"></h2><h2>Off the program</h2>
<p>It wasn&#39;t all work for us, of course -- there was plenty of extra-curricular fun to be had in Portland, from printing and selling out our <a href=\"static/blog/djangsta-shirts-on-sale-at-djangocon\">Djangsta shirts</a> (conceived by Katharine and designed by Christine); to sneaking multiple trips to Powell&#39;s Books and Portland&#39;s famous food carts (<a href=\"http://www.foodcartsportland.com/2009/05/22/whiffies-pie-cart/\">deep fried pie</a> FTW!!); to hosting a <a href=\"static/blog/pyladies-meetup-at-djangocon\">meetup</a> for DjangoCon PyLadies/friends-of-PyLadies at McMeanamin&#39;s Pub on night 2 of the conference. <a href=\"http://myemma.com\">Emma Email Marketing</a> pitched in for generous quantities of beer for us, and we are indebted to Portland PyLady <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pythonchelle\">Michelle</a> for organizing this hugely successful get-together!</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/6145750461_21968427fa_b.jpg\" alt=\"image5\"></p>

<p>The best part about the conference, of course, was meeting, coding, and carousing with Django devs from all over the world, many of whom we&#39;d first conversed with online, via IRC or Twitter. There seemed to be a fair amount of conference buzz circulating about the PyLadies even before we arrived; what an odd feeling it was to have strangers recognize me by my Twitter avatar -- not to mention how odd it felt to introduce myself to others whom I&#39;d recognized in the same manner!</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/djangocon/jeffreco.png\" alt=\"image6\"></p>

<p>Speaking of which: the background tweet-chatter and retweeting of points from sessions we were missing out on was great to follow, sure, but Twitter was also awesome for things like helping out PyLady <a href=\"http://twitter.com/geography76\">Dana</a> when she was having some trouble getting PostgreSQL running on her MacBook Pro, or for reserving Djangsta shirts before they sold out.</p>

<p>Special props go to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/shinjikim\">Shinji</a> and Emily, who used Twitter to reach out to us and find their way into the conference after I tweeted a call for applicants. We&#39;re so excited that people like them are taking the initiative to start PyLadies (or similar) groups all over the country!</p>
<h2>Help from our friends</h2>
<p>Most of this would have been inconceivable without the incredible amount of support we received from a few great people and their companies -- and all we had to do was <a href=\"http://pyladies.com/blog/call-for-sponsorship/\">ask!</a> You can read the <a href=\"static/blog/djangocon-sponsorship-program-results\">full report of the results</a> of our DjangoCon sponsorship program, but suffice it to say here that we were overwhelmed by the response.</p>

<p>We also have to acknowledge the exceptional hospitality of the conference organizers, including Steve, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/theseanoc\">Sean O&#39;Connor</a>, and Nancy Asche, who lavished the PyLadies with care &amp; attention, using every possible opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to seeing diversity flourish in the Python community. It was especially awesome of them to have arranged the weather in Portland to be unseasonably pleasant for us out-of-towners ;)</p>

It&#39;s really exciting to connect with others who want to join us in our efforts to promote Python and open source, and do their part to increase the overall diversity of our community!</p>

<p>We plan to put the money we earned from the tutorials and T-shirt sales toward establishing the PyLadies as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization so that we can continue to do the things we&#39;ve been doing for a long time to come.</p>

<p>All in all, I left Portland feeling inspired by the openness, intelligence, and big-heartedness of the Django community, and I know I&#39;m not the only one.</p>

The theme is &quot;Hacking online audio&quot; - Monday is another PyLadies hack night -- an informal event where people can get together to work on code or just <a href=\"static/chat\">hang out on IRC</a> to do the same. Actually, we&#39;re always around on IRC, so if you&#39;re busy Monday, you can still hang out with us virtually on any other day you want! - Saturday, August 27th is the official <a href=\"http://pyladies-cars-august.eventbrite.com/\">August PyLadies mini-conference/hackathon at Cars.com</a>. This all-day event will begin with a morning session of talks about Django and other cool Python tools, followed by a hackathon.</p>

<p>As you can see, mentors circulated the room throughout the workshop; Michael of Cars.com brought party hats for us to wear so that people knew who to ask for help as they set up their first Django web app. To maintain the party-like atmosphere we also had slides of Python-trivia questions, and threw candy at participants who got answered them correctly! Do YOU know what BDFL stands for?</p>

<p>For lunch we dined on pizza donated by Cars.com, while soaking in some much-needed vitamin D, and spent some time getting to know our fellow hackers a bit better.</p>

<p>Introducing ourselves, we discovered that we came from a wide range of backgrounds, from meditation experts to bioengineers, united by our eagerness to learn this awesome Python-based framework, and our willingness to spend a whole Saturday doing so!</p>

<p>These folks came all the way from Texas!!!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, most attendees chose to push on through the Django tutorial with Sandy, where they delved deeper into Django views and templating. Others hacked away happily on their own Python projects, and later we all learned how to set  deploy our apps on <a href=\"http://djangozoom.com\">DjangoZoom</a>, for which the DjangoZoom folks were generous enough to give us trial accounts. There was, of course, time for a short outdoor break (PyLadies are all about promoting well-rounded, healthy hacking habits!), led by Python dev/capoeira enthusiast PyDanny.</p>

<p>The hackday finished with another fine set of lightning talks:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kjam\">Katharine</a> gave an awesome talk on <a href=\"http://kjamistan.tumblr.com/post/7985900943/how-to-keep-up-with-the-pyladies\">how to keep up with the PyLadies</a></li>
<li>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rdegges\">Randall</a> gave a presentation on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rdegges/intro-to-telephony-in-django\">the awesome Django-Twilio API</a>, for adding telephony features to web apps</li>
<li>  Michael gave <a href=\"http://prezi.com/s82pxzuuvpsa/how-to-get-hired-as-a-new-developer/\">tips on applying for programming jobs</a>, aimed at n00bs but containing good advice for any job-seeker.</li>
<li>  Laura showed us how to use the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rogueveda/whats-in-a-tweet?from=share_email_login3\">Python wrapper for the Twitter API</a> <img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n4l5e6yMgk0/Tix8k5zilkI/AAAAAAAAAJk/c7gdwQzkKzc/s400/IMG_2612.JPG\" alt=\"image4\"></li>
<li>  The indomitable <a href=\"http://twitter.com/sandymahalo\">Sandy</a> found it in her to give another talk, this time on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AVthC0Z3iw8DZGRrdnFzeGdfMmNxd2d3emd2&amp;hl=en_US\">Django testing </a></li>
</ul>

<p>Since no PyLadies event is complete without a social hour, we walked over to Warszawa for a round of drinking and relaxation (i.e., we began formulating plans for tattoos, future PyLadies events, continued world domination, etc).</p>

<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FzxISA0yGeM/Tix8nwLWQ2I/AAAAAAAAAJc/ENfJxdr4Bqk/s400/IMG_2622.JPG\" alt=\"image5\"></p>

<p>Thanks again to our wonderful hosts at Mahalo, particularly CTO Jeff; and also to the crew of Cars.com, most notably Michael, who helped out enormously with every aspect of the event, from tweaking the tutorial to handing out candy for trivia. Also, the hats!</p>

<p>Finally, and as always, thanks to the <a href=\"http://python.org/psf\">PSF</a> for their continued support. We were able to fit twice as many people into our hack space using the tables and chairs they paid for. We&#39;ll also be thanking them in the near future when we announce a few other exciting new developments...</p>

<p>Stay on our mailing list to hear more! Or, if that&#39;s not enough PyLadies for you, <a href=\"http://kjamistan.tumblr.com/post/7985900943/how-to-keep-up-with-the-pyladies\">you know where else to find us</a>!</p>

the expert tutelage of PyLadies developers. In the afternoon,<br>
attendees are encouraged to hack away on their own projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As at the previous <a href=\"static/blog/recap-june-2011-hollywood-hackathon-at-border-stylo\">hackathon in Hollywood</a>, mentors will be available throughout the day to help people on their individual projects and to answer any questions or resolve issues.</p>

<p>Like always, there will be a final hour of lightning talks (if you&#39;ve attended our previous events, now might be a good time to consider presenting something yourself!). And of course there will a social hour following the event which is open to the whole Python community and its extended circles. You know how we love to party!</p>

<p>To register for this low-cost workshop (which includes breakfast, lunch and dinner), visit <a href=\"http://pyladies-django-july.eventbrite.com\">http://pyladies-django-july.eventbrite.com</a>. For more information, email esther @ pyladies dot com.</p>

<p>P.S. Many thanks to the <a href=\"http://python.org/psf\">Python Software Foundation</a> for their generous support!</p>

<h2>Help us get more women to DjangoCon</h2>
<p>What happens when you encourage a talented female Django developer to attend DjangoCon and then give her a free ticket?  First she gets really excited:</p>

<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5888664375/\">|Why is @estherbester going to DjangoCon?|</a></p>

<p>Then she discovers a world of new opportunities.  She gains the confidence to start open-sourcing reusable Django apps.  She contributes to open-source Django projects, maybe even Django itself.</p>

<p>She proposes a talk the following year.  PyLadies mentors her to help get her talk accepted.  She gets accepted and presents on one of her open-source projects.</p>

<p>Her Django app turns out to be so useful that she gets asked to integrate her project into Django core during the sprints ;)</p>

<p>I counted about 5 women at DjangoCon last year.  Let&#39;s make this year different.  Let&#39;s aim to have 25 women.  If there are 250 attendees, that&#39;s 10% women.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>​1. Email audreyr {at} pyladies.com.  Say &quot;I pledge to donate X amount to helping women get to DjangoCon.&quot;</p>

<p>She&#39;ll use this info to let a woman know ASAP that she should get her speaker proposal in before the deadline.  Or to let a potential attendee start making plans.</p>

<p>​2. We&#39;ll send you an email with instructions about how to get the funds to us (probably PayPal or check). Plus background info from me about the woman whom you&#39;re sponsoring, so that you know that this is for real.</p>
<h2>How we decide who gets to go</h2>
<p>Priority will be based on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Genuine financial need</li>
<li>  Desire to speak at DjangoCon, combined with Django expertise and
speaking ability.  Talented potential speakers get extra priority.</li>
<li>  Contributions to open-source</li>
<li>  Contributions to Python women&#39;s advocacy efforts</li>
<li>  Desire to attend</li>
<li>  Impact that attendance will have on her life, especially for
first-time attendees</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ll receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>  an email report from us about the person you&#39;re sponsoring, and why
you made the right decision</li>
<li>  a personal thank-you at DjangoCon from that person</li>
<li>  your link listed on a page that we&#39;ll be putting up for sponsors</li>
<li>  your logo displayed on that page, if you donate substantially more
than others (amount TBD) and/or better placement</li>
<li>  a personal guarantee from me that the PyLadies and I will mentor the
person you sponsored.  We will help them through their Django career
and put friendly pressure on them to contribute to open-source</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases of extreme financial need, we&#39;ll give the woman not just a ticket but help with travel, lodging, and/or food.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a woman reading this and could use assistance, email audreyr {at} pyladies {dot} com.  We&#39;ll do our best to help as many women as possible.</p>

(content ((type .

We invited not only newcomers to Python programming, like those who attended the <a href=\"static/blog/3_intro-to-python-workshop-recap.html\">May Beginner’s Workshop,</a> but also seasoned developers who came to hack away on their own projects -- and who happily volunteered themselves to be mentors to those aforementioned n00bs.</p>

<p>Roughly 60% of the day’s 55 in-person participants and 90% of the 30 remote participants were female, well beyond the PyLadies’ goal of having a 1:1 male-female ratio at Pythonista events.</p>

<p>OSS Bounty</p>

<p>A few days before the hackathon, Audrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/pyladies/status/81081811853258752\">put out the call</a> for hackers to contribute to open source projects, offering these freshly printed PyLadies shirts as a reward for anyone who committed code to a FOSS project (Audrey&#39;s wearing the new one!):</p>

<p>Some of the PyLadies continued to work their way through Zed Shaw’s “<a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">Learn Python the Hard Way,</a>” the book we used at the Beginner’s Workshop. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/ardaniel/status/82242329506881536\">@ardaniel</a> was the first person to earn a PyLadies shirt, by committing to <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a> the exercises she’d done and notes she&#39;d written up from LPTHW. A group of folks had driven down from NorCal to help the SoCal Piggies work on <a href=\"https://github.com/lapython/pythonla\">a new website</a> using the Pyramid web framework. After traveling all that way, it’s no surprise that they opted for the comfy couches:</p>

<p>Even people who couldn’t attend the hackathon in person, citing lame excuses such as not being located in California, were nevertheless invited to join in the fun -- Audrey will be shipping free shirts to everyone who participated remotely and contributed to open-source, including one PyLady who committed code from across the Atlantic:</p>

<p>What time was it in Poland???</p>

<p>During the hackathon we threw the #pyladies IRC chatroom up on the big screen so people could follow online discussions no matter where they were sitting -- without straining their thumbs from alt-tabbing. (PS If you want to join us on IRC anytime, we are in #pyladies on freenode.net!)</p>
<h2>The Future of Python</h2>
<p>After 4 hours of intensive hacking, it was time to take a break! Audrey herded us outside for a group photo. As PyDanny notes, it&#39;s a glimpse of the Python community of the future:</p>

<p>Pretty grand!</p>
<h2>After Dark</h2>
<p>Though the Hollywood sky was outside was warm and bright, we soon drifted back indoors to chow down on Crispy Crust pizza and wings while listening to the end-of-day lightning talks:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Dirk gave a demo of his <a href=\"http://opani.com\">Opani</a> platform, which leverages the cloud for social supercomputing.</li>
<li>  Michael introduced the <a href=\"http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/\">Pyramid</a> web framework and <a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org/\">Jenkins CI</a>.</li>
<li>  Sandy shared some <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg0Rvj-Seto\">amazing</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDqYWsl39Ro\">demos</a> of <a href=\"http://openkinect.org/wiki/Python_Wrapper\">Python</a>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect\">Xbox Kinect</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq9gkdpiS8\">hacking</a></li>
<li>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jacobburch\">Jacob</a> gave a PEP8 talk on best practices</li>
<li>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/jeffschenck\">Jeff</a> admonished us to leave no Windows developers behind</li>
<li>  Katharine and Danny proffered some <a href=\"http://kjamistan.tumblr.com/post/6675268237/on-becoming-a-fabulous-pythonista\">words</a>
of <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer\">encouragement</a> for developers of all skill levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the lightning talks, it was time to clean up, load out, and head over to the Melgard Public House for some well-earned beer and socializing time! This part was originally supposed to be Python Ladies’ Night 4, but once we found that the PyDudes weren’t so bad to hang out with, we gladly invited them along. Fun was had by all!</p>
<h2>Big Thank-Yous</h2>
<p>Gabriel, who played the part of event host on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.borderstylo.com\">Border Stylo</a>, said that of all the events his company has held (which is a lot!), ours was by far the smoothest and most awesome. Hope this means you’ll have us back, Gabe!</p>

<p>We of course have to thank the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/psf/\">Python Software Foundation</a> for giving us <a href=\"static/blog/thank-you-python-software-foundation\">two</a> <a href=\"http://pythonsprints.com\">grants</a> to support this hackathon. Thanks to them, we were able to purchase enough tables and chairs to keep 55 hackers coding happily away in the same room, which led to much mingling and mentoring. They also helped foot the bill for drinks, snacks and dinner, so that we could fortify our hardworking brains with glucose-heavy treats and sodas all day long. And let&#39;s not forget the wonderful T-shirts for open source contributors!</p>
<h2>Coming up....</h2>
<p>We really want to keep the momentum going for opening up the Python community to people of all stripes, and to provide a non-threatening environment where everyone feels welcome to work on their projects and learn to become a better developer without having to worry about whether they fit in or feeling stupid for trying.</p>

<p>To that end, we’ve got at least <a href=\"static/events\">a few more hackathons and other cool outings</a> in the works, so don’t forget to sign up for our mailing list, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pyladies\">follow us on Twitter</a> so you&#39;ll be the first to know when and where and what the PyLadies will be doing next! Thanks to all who attended, whether virtually or in-person -- and sorry to those on the waitlist who couldn&#39;t: we hope you&#39;ll catch us earlier next time, or connect with us online!</p>

<p>The goal was to create a safe, comfortable space for women to learn Python programming and be able to ask questions openly. Men were welcome as volunteers or as the +1 guests of women.</p>

<p>It was clear that this was a gathering of educated, sharp, successful women. Our <strong>female</strong> attendees included:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Grad students from UCLA and CalTech, and over-educated women with multiple degrees and Ph.Ds.</li>
<li>  Senior marketers and community managers with over 10,000 Twitter followers, working on prominent tech projects</li>
<li>  UX (user experience) professionals working for top companies</li>
<li>  Research scientists currently using other languages in their labs for numerical analysis</li>
<li>  Co-founders of startups, with 1 or more funded and/or successful companies under their belt</li>
<li>  Experienced software engineers with Java, C++, .NET, PHP backgrounds</li>
<li>  Product managers at top companies</li>
<li>  Talented Linux sysadmins</li>
<li>  Hardware hackers involved with the various LA area hackerspaces</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on. Many were happily employed, but some were looking for technical jobs. I&#39;m hoping some of the job seekers apply to work at KPCC, our venue sponsor!</p>

<p>In the morning, Katharine and I did a walkthrough of the popular <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org\">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> tutorial by Zed Shaw. Attendees typed along with each exercise. At the end of each exercise, we reviewed the new concepts covered.</p>

<p>During lunch, KPCC&#39;s senior web producer Jason Georges took everyone on a tour behind the scenes of the radio station. KPCC is full of cool things like soundproof glass cube recording rooms.</p>

<p>Then we were greeted by former NFL player and pastry chef George Wrighster with a surprise tray of cupcakes from his bakery, <a href=\"http://www.violetscakes.com/\">Violet&#39;s Cakes</a>. Yummy!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we split up into smaller breakout sessions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  craping the Web with Python, or How I Automatically Get Happy Hour Specials Delivered to my Inbox</li>
<li>  Intro to Django with the Django Poll Tutorial</li>
<li>  Learn Python The Hard Way, Part 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the PyLadies volunteer organizers gave lightning talks:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Equality: Equivalence in Python by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse\">Jess Stanton</a></li>
<li>  Project Euler Demo by <a href=\"http://www.xtine.net/\">Christine Cheung</a></li>
<li>  Python Web Frameworks by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/kjam\">Katharine Jarmul</a></li>
<li>  Generators by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/sandymahalo\">Sandy Strong</a></li>
<li>  Ergonomics by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/estherbester\">Esther Nam</a></li>
<li>  The Code Behind PyLadies.com by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/audreyr\">Audrey Roy</a></li>
<li>  Inequality: Stories from the Python &amp; Developer Communities by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse\">Jess Stanton</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, we celebrated over root beer floats. It was interesting and exciting to see that no one wanted to leave at the end! I was thrilled and floating on a cloud, and so were all the other organizers and volunteers.</p>

<p>Thank you to our special out-of-town guests! If there&#39;s anything we can do to help you in any way with your local women&#39;s developer communities, let us know.</p>

")))) ("How to hook people on CS through Magic" "<h1>Computer Science Outreach Magic</h1>
<p><em>Thanks to Katie Cunningham of Tucson for letting us copy this post from <a href=\"http://katieirenec.blogspot.com/2013/03/computer-science-outreach-magic.html\">her blog</a>!</em></p>
<p>For several months, I always carried a deck of cards in my backpack. I like playing gin rummy as much as anyone, but that's not the reason why. I carried them because I had discovered <strong><em>Computer Science Outreach Magic</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I learned a Computer Science magic trick from <a href=\"http://cs4fn.org/magic\">cs4fn.org/magic</a>, and I've been hooked ever since. I've performed this trick to much success when manning booths at outreach events and teacher visiting days. It lets you engage people while illustrating a bit of computer science. At the PyLadies' lunch at <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon '13</a>, Esther Nam convinced me to write a blog post about this card trick I was so excited about. &quot;Lots of people want to know how to demonstrate computer science without a computer!&quot; she said.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QWERYs18cuw/UUWEUHD2leI/AAAAAAAAAEI/DNVDS_mvWNo/s400/cards1.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching the card trick to Computer Science student volunteers at the Tucson Festival of Books.\"></p>
<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7zkM7b9NU3c/UVeDQxvHd5I/AAAAAAAAALM/6nes0mg8Vxg/s400/cards2_light.jpg\" alt=\"Performing the big reveal at a University of Arizona College of Science ceremony.\"></p>
<p>That's exactly why I love this trick. It's portable, it's easy, and it doesn't use a computer. It allows people to see an easily digestible example of the logic, discrete math, and information that is at the core of Computer Science. For people who aren't impressed by physical computers or cryptic terminal windows, this can really be a draw.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Computer science] is not really about computers -- and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes.... Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use.&quot; - Hal Abelson (1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Here's how I do it:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You need <strong>three people</strong>: The magician, the assistant, and the learner.</p></li>
<li><p>The magician closes her eyes and <strong>keeps them closed until the end of the trick</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The learner is given the deck and told to <strong>make a four by four matrix of cards with some face up and some face down, randomly distributed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PaDicUidMdc/UVlR53gTf7I/AAAAAAAAAM4/6151cf6yKZE/s200/2013-03-31+13.36.14.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>
<ul>
<li>The assistant takes the deck back and whispers to the learner: <strong>&quot;I'm going to make it harder for her and add another row and column&quot;.</strong> The magician might groan at this point and say &quot;Nooo it's so hard already!!!&quot; The new row and column are added.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SjXhvfiM7ks/UVlR5KOW9oI/AAAAAAAAAM0/YnuzY62o7g4/s200/2013-03-31+13.37.51.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>
<ul>
<li>The assistant tells the learner to flip one card, and that the magician will tell him which card he flipped. <strong>The learner flips one card.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rd8vxAd32pU/UVlR2EGsu5I/AAAAAAAAAMs/Ie0E7w2SL0k/s200/2013-03-31+13.39.49.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The magician opens her eyes, hovers her hands over the cards, and <strong>identifies the flipped card!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The learner is very impressed. While the amazement hasn't worn off, the magician and assistant tell the learner that <strong>this method is used to identify errors in computer data.</strong> Face up and face down cards are just like the way a computer stores information in 1s and 0s. Perhaps the information is being sent from one computer to another and one of the bits -- one of the 1s or 0s -- gets changed to the other (flipped!). Computer Scientists invented this technique so computers could discover where the error took place. If the learner is still interested, explain how the trick worked.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How does the trick work??!!??</h2>
<p>When the assistant adds the extra row and column, he is actually adding <strong>parity bits</strong>. For non-CS people, that means that the assistant adds another card to each row and column so <strong>the sum of face up cards in that row or column is now even</strong>. If there are an even number of face up cards in the row or column, the assistant adds a face down. If there are an odd number of face down cards in the row or column, he adds a face up.</p>
<p>The cards need to be put down seemingly without thought, like the assistant is just adding the extra row and column randomly. Here's a walkthrough:</p>
<p>Add a parity bit to the end of each of the columns</p>
<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-43G67TR9qx0/UVnMUg5xkeI/AAAAAAAAANM/wQSrpONYsrU/s320/paritied_with_row_merged.png\" alt=\"\"></p>
<p>Add a parity bit to all of the rows, including the row you just added. (Notice that the column you are adding has parity automatically.)</p>
<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f-glidmmt-k/UVnMYM6168I/AAAAAAAAANU/KLLIjMNfJis/s320/paritied_with_col_merged.png\" alt=\"\"></p>
<p>Now when the learner flips a card, the row and column of the card that was flipped have an odd number of face up cards! You can quickly find the flipped card, even though you've never seen the grid before.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0PjjohEdhy0/UVnQyXP4lDI/AAAAAAAAANk/bXKXQWyY14U/s320/found_it.png\" alt=\"\"></p>
<p>It works just as well when the flipped card is in the parity row or column.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--5Vj10M2eoQ/UVnQz1T9AOI/AAAAAAAAANs/GY4dr0GOClI/s320/found_it_side.png\" alt=\"\"></p>
<p>The kids at the CSUnplugged show figured it out on their own, I was very impressed. The presenters used this trick as their opening act, and then explained it at the very end, so the kids had some time to think about it. If you want to see their explanation, check out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gBPZOpT4DPU\">this video</a></p>
<h2>Optional Follow-up</h2>
<p>Make sure the learner really understands by <strong>putting the cards back into their parity'd state and asking him to close his eyes and guess which card his friend flipped</strong>. This is demoed in the video above. If you have more time for more than a quick wow moment, you can ask the learner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it matter if the error is in the parity bits?</li>
<li>Is it possible to detect two errors, and if so, can they be corrected?</li>
<li>How about three errors?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Practice!</h2>
<p>I'm sure you are excited now to show this trick to all your friends. With this trick in your pocket, every person becomes someone you can impress with computer science! You'll live for the stunned look on people's faces when you pick the right card!</p>
<p>But to make it go smoothly, you'll need to <strong>practice practice practice practice</strong>! The trick might sound simple enough, but every time I or someone else has attempted the trick without recent practice, it has been a major fail.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dASy6SDRpKk/UVkf-MZPdTI/AAAAAAAAALk/pjaO4G3DPso/s200/2013-03-30+13.36.13.jpg\" alt=\"Practice with your cat! And people.\"></p>
<p>Practice with your cat! And people.</p>
<h2>Alternate versions</h2>
<p>I like doing this trick with cards because cards are easy to get my hands on when I'm inspired to perform. Usually I have limited table space, so it's hard to squeeze in more cards than I have described. In the CSUnplugged version, they start with a larger grid and black and white squares. (Note that it doesn't matter how big your grid is -- the trick works the same.) They also had the nifty idea to make them magnetic so the trick can be performed on a whiteboard.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CfcakI791kE/UU3hycAFaQI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/C8VUDQ5swZU/s640/parity_trick.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>
<p>CSUnplugged has the magician add the extra row, eliminating the assistant. I like having the assistant better, because the magician's reveal is more impressive, since clearly no memorization is done -- the magician hasn't seen the cards at all! Also, when a little kid is the learner, the assistant is necessary to make sure he or she puts down the cards correctly and flips only one card. But for a demonstration in front of a classroom or when you're alone, it's worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Find the original cs4fn version of the trick on page 25 here: <a href=\"http://www.cs4fn.org/magic/downloads/cs4fnmagicbook1.pdf\">http://www.cs4fn.org/magic/downloads/cs4fnmagicbook1.pdf</a>. They add the extra row based on face down cards instead of face up cards. It doesn't matter really of course -- do what's easier to see quickly. Or if you change the size of the grid to have an even number of rows and columns at the end of the trick, it doesn't matter! Face up and face down will both have to be even or odd.</p>
<p>P.s. Now that you are using this trick, you have to watch out for Magnita Makov, world's greatest magician.</p>
<p><strong>Good luck! Go forth and impress all your friends!!!</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanks to Katie Cunningham of Tucson for letting us copy this post from <a href=\"http://katieirenec.blogspot.com/2013/03/computer-science-outreach-magic.html\">her blog</a>!</em></p>

<p>For several months, I always carried a deck of cards in my backpack. I like playing gin rummy as much as anyone, but that&#39;s not the reason why. I carried them because I had discovered <strong><em>Computer Science Outreach Magic</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I learned a Computer Science magic trick from <a href=\"http://cs4fn.org/magic\">cs4fn.org/magic</a>, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. I&#39;ve performed this trick to much success when manning booths at outreach events and teacher visiting days. It lets you engage people while illustrating a bit of computer science. At the PyLadies&#39; lunch at <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2013/\">PyCon &#39;13</a>, Esther Nam convinced me to write a blog post about this card trick I was so excited about. &quot;Lots of people want to know how to demonstrate computer science without a computer!&quot; she said.</p>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QWERYs18cuw/UUWEUHD2leI/AAAAAAAAAEI/DNVDS_mvWNo/s400/cards1.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching the card trick to Computer Science student volunteers at the Tucson Festival of Books.\"></p>

<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7zkM7b9NU3c/UVeDQxvHd5I/AAAAAAAAALM/6nes0mg8Vxg/s400/cards2_light.jpg\" alt=\"Performing the big reveal at a University of Arizona College of Science ceremony.\"></p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly why I love this trick. It&#39;s portable, it&#39;s easy, and it doesn&#39;t use a computer. It allows people to see an easily digestible example of the logic, discrete math, and information that is at the core of Computer Science. For people who aren&#39;t impressed by physical computers or cryptic terminal windows, this can really be a draw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Computer science] is not really about computers -- and it&#39;s not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes.... Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don&#39;t really understand it very well, it&#39;s very easy to confuse the essence of what you&#39;re doing with the tools that you use.&quot; - Hal Abelson (1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Here&#39;s how I do it:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You need <strong>three people</strong>: The magician, the assistant, and the learner.</p></li>
<li><p>The magician closes her eyes and <strong>keeps them closed until the end of the trick</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The learner is given the deck and told to <strong>make a four by four matrix of cards with some face up and some face down, randomly distributed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PaDicUidMdc/UVlR53gTf7I/AAAAAAAAAM4/6151cf6yKZE/s200/2013-03-31+13.36.14.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

<ul>
<li>The assistant takes the deck back and whispers to the learner: <strong>&quot;I&#39;m going to make it harder for her and add another row and column&quot;.</strong> The magician might groan at this point and say &quot;Nooo it&#39;s so hard already!!!&quot; The new row and column are added.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SjXhvfiM7ks/UVlR5KOW9oI/AAAAAAAAAM0/YnuzY62o7g4/s200/2013-03-31+13.37.51.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>

</ul>

"))) ("How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Rebase" "<p>Rebase is a downright scary concept. When the best way to explain how it works I've heard starts with thinking that you're time-traveling back to before certain changes were ever introduced to a project, you probably should be afraid. We've all read enough science fiction to know what happens if you go back to the Age of the Dinosaurs and step on an ugly-looking bug.</p>
<p>But while rebase is a responsibility to take seriously - especially if you're working on a team and you could wipe out every commit people have added since last Sunday - perhaps we're in less danger from time travel paradoxes than I previously assumed.</p>
<h2>A Quick Example of Rebase</h2>
<p>Just so we all are on the same page, let's go through a quick example of how you might use rebase:</p>
<p>Let's assume that you have a git repository with a file in it and that you've branched that file and made some changes. Meanwhile, someone else has modified that same file on the master branch. In order to get everything put back together again, you may consider using git rebase. To do so, you would need to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ git rebase master
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. There might be some conflicts that you'd need to go in and clean up if your co-coder has been up to some serious business since you've last merged in your changes, but the command itself is simple. Now it looks like your changes started from the current master rather than from the original branch point.</p>
<p>If you want to now add your up-to-date changes back into the master, you'll still need to merge it in.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge branchname
</code></pre>
<p>How is this whole process different from just using git merge in the first place? It's just prettier: someone going through the code's history would see straight forward progress along the master branch.</p>
<h2>A Better Metaphor for Rebase</h2>
<p>Rebase is generally considered a slightly-nuclear option. It's possible to be careful about rebasing code, say by duplicating the master branch and rebasing your code on that new version to see if you accidentally destroy the world before trying to rebase within the actual master. Somehow, though, we still see it as something dangerous.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/index-en.html\"><img src=\"http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/rebase.svg\" align=\"right\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/></a></p>
<p>Perhaps a new metaphor may be more useful here. I'm the type to go out and read a bunch about a particular command before I'll get comfortable with using it. I've gone over <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing\">this section from ProGit</a> a couple of times and something finally became clear: when you rebase, you can reorder a whole bunch of different things!</p>
<p>For me, this is like sewing. When I was little, I would help my grandmother with her sewing projects. She grew up in the Great Depression and not one bit of material would ever go to waste in her sewing room. A piece of clothing didn't fit right? She'd tailor it. A seam wound up in the wrong place? She'd rip it out and go again. A project went horribly, horribly wrong? She'd take it apart and put it together again in a different way.</p>
<p>Rebase is a seam ripper and a bowl full of pins, all in one. You've got a bunch of concrete pieces of code that you've committed over time and you can rip them apart with rebase. In the same action, you can pin them back together and run them through the sewing machine again. As a result, you're not just limited to what you might do with the master branch and whatever branch you've been working on seperately. </p>
<p>Just like in sewing, though, there are some rules that you absolutely need to follow. The &quot;don't accidentally sew your fingers to the garment&quot; rule of rebasing is that <strong>you should never rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.</strong> It's not out of the question to fix such a problem (and there's probably less blood than the sewing machine-finger combo), but it requires some serious clean up.</p>
<h2>Measure Twice, Cut Once</h2>
<p>In fact, as long as you're taking proper precautions, it's possible to come back from most rebase screw ups (though this opinion is based on my own, admittedly limited, experience). The precautions seems a little tedious, just like measuring fabric twice and double-checking that you know what to do with your pattern can be. But that tedium can help you avoid big screw-ups, even if you never notice the accident you avoided.</p>
<p>The moment that I realized that rebase isn't so much a bomb as a seam ripper, it was a lot less worrying to type in that command and hit 'enter.'</p>

<p>I started a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX/\">PyLadies chapter in Portland, OR</a> last September (2012). We started out with weekly meetings to do homework from a Coursera class to make games with Python. That turned into weekly meetings -- plus homework meetups on Saturdays at a local coffee shop, and IRC hangout time to test homework. And that turned into me giving mini-lessons at each Coursera meetup about the material from the class. People seemed really excited.</p>

<p>Before we knew it, it was December, we had over 60 women subscribed to the Meetup, 30 of which had attended a meeting. Today, we've got 85 subscribers, 50 people have attended a meeting, and more have signed up to attend events in the future than ever before. And, it's done by women. Using open source. Teaching classes. Learning developer tools. And writing software.</p>
<p>Since September, I've met even more women involved in <a href=\"http://www.pyladies.com/locations/\">running PyLadies chapters</a> across the country. Much like the way the PostgreSQL community is organized, we've got a loosely connected group of people working independently. We offer support to each other, but don't have hard and fast rules about what each chapter does. We encourage teaching and workshops, but don't require them. We share our resources and are quick to put git repos out there of our materials. We send lots of pull requests. And we're constantly looking for ways for women to get more involved in open source and Python.</p>

<p>I'm completely energized by the positive feedback we've gotten for every meeting. More recently, I've heard from people that they feel confident and sure of their knowledge because they've spent time in our meetups talking and learning from other women.</p>
<p>My goal is to make every get together like that - by having great lessons, a shared understanding of coaching and peer-based education and presentations from our members. Building these groups takes time, and I'm impatient to get to the part where I feel like every interaction with the group is rewarding for every member.</p>
<p>And I can't do it alone. We've got four meetup organizers (although one is about to relocate to the Bay Area!). I work closely with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/floraworley\">Flora Worley</a>, a kickass developer who chose programming as a career path after working on a PhD, on topic details and planning for the meetings.

PyLady Katie's <a href=\"http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/aug/7/djangocon-dc-tips/\">wonderful blog</a>! She will be writing a <a href=\"http://therealkatie.net/blog/\">series of posts</a> to help Djangonauts from all over feel at home in the U.S. capital come early September!</em>]</p>
<h2>Coming to DjangoCon in September? Let's have a chat about DC.</h2>
<p>by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kcunning\">Katie Cunningham</a> (with mad props to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jackiekazil\">Jackie Kazil</a>, who helped write this post!)</p>
<h3>The location</h3>
<p><a href=\"http://djangocon.us/\">DjangoCon DC</a> is actually in Northern Virginia, not in the heart of the Capitol. Specifically, it's being held in Crystal City at the Hyatt Regency, which is close to the Crystal City Metro Station (the yellow and blue metro lines) and one stop away from Reagan National Airport (DCA).</p>
<p>I worked in the area for many years, and while it doesn't have as much of the DC grit and history, it makes up for in being a great nexus between convenience and cost. As someone who's been to several conferences in DC, I can tell you this is a good thing. It is a safe, clean, affordable, and transportation-accessible part of the DC metro area that is littered with Django developers.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you aren't going to be staying at the conference's hotel, you're in luck. DC has a LOT of hotels. In general, the closer they are to a metro stop, the more expensive they are, but it's still possible to find no-frills hotels very close to a metro stop. If you want to remain close to the main action, I would get a hotel at L'Enfant (which is close to the Mall), Crystal City, or National Airport. Franconia/Springfield may look convenient, but it's actually not close to anything.</p>
<h3>Getting to DC</h3><h4>Flying</h4>
<p><a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;aq=0&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Ronald+Reagan+Washington+National+Airport,+1+Aviation+Circle,+Arlington,+Virginia&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=211095113154214193828.0004af190da676086d76b&amp;sll=38.849312,-77.041175&amp;sspn=0.01738,0.032015&amp;t=m&amp;ll=39.155622,-77.025146&amp;spn=0.745426,1.167297&amp;z=9\">View DC airports in a larger map</a></p>
<p>There are three airports in the D.C. region. Travel sites like Hipmunk and Kayak try to make all our local airports equivalent, as if it's just a short jaunt from each to DC. This is a dirty, nasty lie.</p>
<p>The airport visible from the hotel is Reagan National. It is only one metro stop from the hotel (or just under a mile walk if you are crazy). The other airports, Dulles and BWI, are inconvenient but usually cheaper if you are on a budget and willing to spend an extra hour to two hours using a combination of shuttle services, Amtrak, buses, metro. If you choose to stomach one of the other options, then add about $15 to your trip. If you take a taxi, you could end up spending more than the cost of your savings.</p>
<p>If you're coming in on an international flight, it may be worth looking for a flight that lands at some other international airport like Atlanta or New York, then catch a flight into Reagan. Trust me, you will not regret this.</p>
<h4>Train</h4>
<p>The train station is located at Union Station. It can be nice way to travel if you are on the Eastern Seaboard. The commute from Union Station to the conference isn't bad, since Union Station is also a metro stop.</p>
<p>Chinatown buses and other bus services<br>
For those on a budget or looking for adventure and located on the Eastern Seaboard you might check look into the Chinatown buses. Various companies in Chinatown shuttle to Baltimore, Philideplia, New York, and Boston. D.C. to New York is between three and five hours (depending on your driver aherance to the speed limit) and costs around $20 each way. They will drop you off in Chinatown near the metro, which is the same metro line that you would need to get to the conference. Sometimes you can find a service that offers wifi and plugs and sometimes there are live animals and sketchy late night stops. Adventure!</p>
<p>Other buses services will drop you off in other parts, but they are usually close to a metro stop. Bolt Bus is probably one of the nicest.</p>
<h4>Driving</h4>
<p>Don't. It's not worth it unless you are car pooling. You won't need your car while visiting. If you do though, you can park you car at the Hotel (expect to pay a pretty hefty amount per night, though). If you want to bring your car, bring a GPS and some antacids. I've been told we're pretty bad drivers around here.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>DC's metro is stupidly simple and is probably going to all the places you want to go. DC metro area cabs are priced pretty well as a back up. I wouldn't bother to rent a car.</p>
<p>However, if you want to rent a bike, I have good news! There's a <a href=\"http://revolutioncycles.com/about/city-hub-central-pg602.htm\">Revolution Cycles</a> in Crystal City that rents bikes by the week. I spoke with the owners, and they have about 100 bikes available. Given how many people are going to be in town, they recommended reserving one ahead of time.</p>
<p>I'm no bike enthusiast (I still think my green Huffy was pretty rad), but I have been informed by bike geeks that these are good bikes.</p>
<p>There is also <a href=\"http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/\">BikeShare</a>, which is like Zipcars for bikes, through DC and in the conference hotel neighbor. Bring your own helmet, though. Don't be one of those guys. But there are only 10 spots at the hotel, so don't count on easily finding a bike at the conference. This is a better option used to tool around D.C. for a couple hours.</p>
<p>At the moment, I don't have much information regarding bike parking at the hotel. Hotels in the region are starting to have bike parking sections available, but if you're renting a bike for the week, keep in mind that you might be keeping it in your room (I hope I'm wrong).</p>
<p>More soon!<br>
I'm going to post something about our tourist scene, if anyone is interested in seeing the sites while you're here.</p>

"))) ("Government Fellowship Opportunity" "<p>The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is hiring a group of 30 designers and developers (Python- and Wordpress-friendly) to improve internal operations and the way that we interact with the public. The CFPB is a US government agency.</p>
<p>They are offering a <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/design-technology-fellows/\">Design+Technology Fellowship</a>: a two-year program for developers, graphic designers, and UX pros to help build a new government agency almost from the ground up.</p>
<p>Join us, and you will be given an opportunity to help create a dream technology environment for a new organization. In the process, you’ll improve the lives of millions of Americans. Maybe you’re just out of college and you are looking to sharpen your skills. Or maybe you want a break from building widgets and want to spend some time making things that really matter.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fantastic way for a few good (or even a whole lot of) Pythonistas to make a big difference in many citizens' lives!</p>
<p>You'd better hop to it, though - the deadline for applying to the Fellowship is this Friday, July 13th.  Email <a href=\"mailto:info@pyladies.com\">info@pyladies.com</a> if you have any questions and we'll direct you to the contact person for this opportunity.</p>

The CFPB is a US government agency.</p>

<p>They are offering a <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/design-technology-fellows/\">Design+Technology Fellowship</a>: a two-year program for developers, graphic designers, and UX pros to help build a new government agency almost from the ground up.</p>

<p>Join us, and you will be given an opportunity to help create a dream technology environment for a new organization. In the process, you’ll improve the lives of millions of Americans. Maybe you’re just out of college and you are looking to sharpen your skills. Or maybe you want a break from building widgets and want to spend some time making things that really matter.</p>

<p>Sounds like a fantastic way for a few good (or even a whole lot of) Pythonistas to make a big difference in many citizens&#39; lives!</p>

<p>You&#39;d better hop to it, though - the deadline for applying to the Fellowship is this Friday, July 13th.  Email <a href=\"mailto:info@pyladies.com\">info@pyladies.com</a> if you have any questions and we&#39;ll direct you to the contact person for this opportunity.</p>

<p>Jessica is a kernel engineer from Cambridge, Massachusetts. She's a maintainer of several open source Python projects, most notably Twisted and OpenHatch. She's also working on a new edition of Twisted Networking Essentials for O'Reilly.</p>
<p>On top of her open source contributions, she is also a Python Software Foundation board member and a crucial part in the Boston Python User Group, the largest Python user group in the world.

<p><a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu\">USC's Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism</a> hosted a beginner's Python workshop that was even bigger than the first one we held back in May. 50-odd geeks, nerds, and similar fought their way through some unexpected downtown traffic to attend this tutorial, taught by PyLadies kjam, Sandy, and xtine.</p>
<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/1stprogram.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>
<p>It was a bright crowd, with most people Learning Python the Hard Way at a fairly rapid clip. They were impatient to learn about web scraping from kjam, and eager to follow along with the code samples presented at the end-of-day lightning talks.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu\">USC&#39;s Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism</a> hosted a beginner&#39;s Python workshop that was even bigger than the first one we held back in May. 50-odd geeks, nerds, and similar fought their way through some unexpected downtown traffic to attend this tutorial, taught by PyLadies kjam, Sandy, and xtine.</p>

<p><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/1stprogram.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>

<p>It was a bright crowd, with most people Learning Python the Hard Way at a fairly rapid clip. They were impatient to learn about web scraping from kjam, and eager to follow along with the code samples presented at the end-of-day lightning talks.</p>

<p>Photos from this event are up on our <a href=\"https://secure.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/sets/72157628083649345/\">Flickr page</a>! BIG thanks to Geneva Oh of USC Annenberg and Prof. <strong>Robert Hernandez</strong>for proposing, organizing and promoting this workshop for USC students and journalists (including one intrepid nerd-to-be who flew in from Arizona solely for this event!), as well as sponsoring the venue and food.</p>

<p>Lightning talks from</p>

<p><strong>xtine</strong>: scraping data from a music website for fun!</p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Why Documentation Matters</p>

<p><strong>Robin</strong>: <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39730/pyladiesblog/usc/ListComps.ppt\">Python List Comprensions</a> [.ppt]</p>

<p><strong>Emma</strong>: &quot;<a href=\"http://djangolookslikefun.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/lightning-talk-hello-world/\">Hello world!</a>&quot; (an encore by popular demand)</p>

<p><strong>Leo</strong>: I can&#39;t remember at the moment but I&#39;m sure it was fabulous!</p>

<p><a href=\"http://cars.com\">Cars.com</a> generously hosted a post-workshop PyLadies social hour, plying us with beer and delicious appetizers from the campus bar. Thanks to Michael and Robin from Cars for giving up their Saturday for us!  Likewise to our brilliant volunteer corps -- the event would not have been as successful without your participation and we are grateful! =)</p>

<h2>Help us get more women to DjangoCon</h2>
<p>What happens when you encourage a talented female Django developer to attend DjangoCon and then give her a free ticket?  First she gets really excited:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pyladies/5888664375/\">|Why is @estherbester going to DjangoCon?|</a></p>
<p>Then she discovers a world of new opportunities.  She gains the confidence to start open-sourcing reusable Django apps.  She contributes to open-source Django projects, maybe even Django itself.</p>
<p>She proposes a talk the following year.  PyLadies mentors her to help get her talk accepted.  She gets accepted and presents on one of her open-source projects.</p>
<p>Her Django app turns out to be so useful that she gets asked to integrate her project into Django core during the sprints ;)</p>
<p>I counted about 5 women at DjangoCon last year.  Let's make this year different.  Let's aim to have 25 women.  If there are 250 attendees, that's 10% women.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>​1. Email audreyr {at} pyladies.com.  Say &quot;I pledge to donate X amount to helping women get to DjangoCon.&quot;</p>
<p>She'll use this info to let a woman know ASAP that she should get her speaker proposal in before the deadline.  Or to let a potential attendee start making plans.</p>
<p>​2. We'll send you an email with instructions about how to get the funds to us (probably PayPal or check). Plus background info from me about the woman whom you're sponsoring, so that you know that this is for real.</p>
<h2>How we decide who gets to go</h2>
<p>Priority will be based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Genuine financial need</li>
<li>  Desire to speak at DjangoCon, combined with Django expertise and
speaking ability.  Talented potential speakers get extra priority.</li>
<li>  Contributions to open-source</li>
<li>  Contributions to Python women's advocacy efforts</li>
<li>  Desire to attend</li>
<li>  Impact that attendance will have on her life, especially for
first-time attendees</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>  an email report from us about the person you're sponsoring, and why
you made the right decision</li>
<li>  a personal thank-you at DjangoCon from that person</li>
<li>  your link listed on a page that we'll be putting up for sponsors</li>
<li>  your logo displayed on that page, if you donate substantially more
than others (amount TBD) and/or better placement</li>
<li>  a personal guarantee from me that the PyLadies and I will mentor the
person you sponsored.  We will help them through their Django career
and put friendly pressure on them to contribute to open-source</li>

<p>In cases of extreme financial need, we'll give the woman not just a ticket but help with travel, lodging, and/or food.</p>

We invited not only newcomers to Python programming, like those who attended the <a href=\"static/blog/3_intro-to-python-workshop-recap.html\">May Beginner’s Workshop,</a> but also seasoned developers who came to hack away on their own projects -- and who happily volunteered themselves to be mentors to those aforementioned n00bs.</p>
<p>Roughly 60% of the day’s 55 in-person participants and 90% of the 30 remote participants were female, well beyond the PyLadies’ goal of having a 1:1 male-female ratio at Pythonista events.</p>
<p>OSS Bounty</p>
<p>A few days before the hackathon, Audrey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/pyladies/status/81081811853258752\">put out the call</a> for hackers to contribute to open source projects, offering these freshly printed PyLadies shirts as a reward for anyone who committed code to a FOSS project (Audrey's wearing the new one!):</p>
<p>Some of the PyLadies continued to work their way through Zed Shaw’s “<a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">Learn Python the Hard Way,</a>” the book we used at the Beginner’s Workshop. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/ardaniel/status/82242329506881536\">@ardaniel</a> was the first person to earn a PyLadies shirt, by committing to <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a> the exercises she’d done and notes she'd written up from LPTHW. A group of folks had driven down from NorCal to help the SoCal Piggies work on <a href=\"https://github.com/lapython/pythonla\">a new website</a> using the Pyramid web framework. After traveling all that way, it’s no surprise that they opted for the comfy couches:</p>
<p>Even people who couldn’t attend the hackathon in person, citing lame excuses such as not being located in California, were nevertheless invited to join in the fun -- Audrey will be shipping free shirts to everyone who participated remotely and contributed to open-source, including one PyLady who committed code from across the Atlantic:</p>
<p>What time was it in Poland???</p>
<p>During the hackathon we threw the #pyladies IRC chatroom up on the big screen so people could follow online discussions no matter where they were sitting -- without straining their thumbs from alt-tabbing. (PS If you want to join us on IRC anytime, we are in #pyladies on freenode.net!)</p>
<h2>The Future of Python</h2>
<p>After 4 hours of intensive hacking, it was time to take a break! Audrey herded us outside for a group photo. As PyDanny notes, it's a glimpse of the Python community of the future:</p>
<p>Pretty grand!</p>
<h2>After Dark</h2>
<p>Though the Hollywood sky was outside was warm and bright, we soon drifted back indoors to chow down on Crispy Crust pizza and wings while listening to the end-of-day lightning talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Dirk gave a demo of his <a href=\"http://opani.com\">Opani</a> platform, which leverages the cloud for social supercomputing.</li>

<li>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jacobburch\">Jacob</a> gave a PEP8 talk on best practices</li>
<li>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/jeffschenck\">Jeff</a> admonished us to leave no Windows developers behind</li>

of <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer\">encouragement</a> for developers of all skill levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the lightning talks, it was time to clean up, load out, and head over to the Melgard Public House for some well-earned beer and socializing time! This part was originally supposed to be Python Ladies’ Night 4, but once we found that the PyDudes weren’t so bad to hang out with, we gladly invited them along. Fun was had by all!</p>
<h2>Big Thank-Yous</h2>
<p>Gabriel, who played the part of event host on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.borderstylo.com\">Border Stylo</a>, said that of all the events his company has held (which is a lot!), ours was by far the smoothest and most awesome. Hope this means you’ll have us back, Gabe!</p>
<p>We of course have to thank the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/psf/\">Python Software Foundation</a> for giving us <a href=\"static/blog/thank-you-python-software-foundation\">two</a> <a href=\"http://pythonsprints.com\">grants</a> to support this hackathon. Thanks to them, we were able to purchase enough tables and chairs to keep 55 hackers coding happily away in the same room, which led to much mingling and mentoring. They also helped foot the bill for drinks, snacks and dinner, so that we could fortify our hardworking brains with glucose-heavy treats and sodas all day long. And let's not forget the wonderful T-shirts for open source contributors!</p>
<h2>Coming up....</h2>
<p>We really want to keep the momentum going for opening up the Python community to people of all stripes, and to provide a non-threatening environment where everyone feels welcome to work on their projects and learn to become a better developer without having to worry about whether they fit in or feeling stupid for trying.</p>
<p>To that end, we’ve got at least <a href=\"static/events\">a few more hackathons and other cool outings</a> in the works, so don’t forget to sign up for our mailing list, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pyladies\">follow us on Twitter</a> so you'll be the first to know when and where and what the PyLadies will be doing next!

"))) ("PyLadies Intro to Python Workshop" "<p>On Sunday, May 15, 2011, the PyLadies held an Intro to Python workshop at KPCC's Crawford Family Forum in Pasadena.</p>
<p>The goal was to create a safe, comfortable space for women to learn Python programming and be able to ask questions openly. Men were welcome as volunteers or as the +1 guests of women.</p>
<p>It was clear that this was a gathering of educated, sharp, successful women. Our <strong>female</strong> attendees included:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Grad students from UCLA and CalTech, and over-educated women with multiple degrees and Ph.Ds.</li>
<li>  Senior marketers and community managers with over 10,000 Twitter followers, working on prominent tech projects</li>
<li>  UX (user experience) professionals working for top companies</li>
<li>  Research scientists currently using other languages in their labs for numerical analysis</li>
<li>  Co-founders of startups, with 1 or more funded and/or successful companies under their belt</li>
<li>  Experienced software engineers with Java, C++, .NET, PHP backgrounds</li>
<li>  Product managers at top companies</li>
<li>  Talented Linux sysadmins</li>
<li>  Hardware hackers involved with the various LA area hackerspaces</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on. Many were happily employed, but some were looking for technical jobs. I'm hoping some of the job seekers apply to work at KPCC, our venue sponsor!</p>
<p>In the morning, Katharine and I did a walkthrough of the popular <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org\">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> tutorial by Zed Shaw. Attendees typed along with each exercise. At the end of each exercise, we reviewed the new concepts covered.</p>
<p>During lunch, KPCC's senior web producer Jason Georges took everyone on a tour behind the scenes of the radio station. KPCC is full of cool things like soundproof glass cube recording rooms.</p>
<p>Then we were greeted by former NFL player and pastry chef George Wrighster with a surprise tray of cupcakes from his bakery, <a href=\"http://www.violetscakes.com/\">Violet's Cakes</a>. Yummy!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we split up into smaller breakout sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>  craping the Web with Python, or How I Automatically Get Happy Hour Specials Delivered to my Inbox</li>
<li>  Intro to Django with the Django Poll Tutorial</li>
<li>  Learn Python The Hard Way, Part 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the PyLadies volunteer organizers gave lightning talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Equality: Equivalence in Python by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse\">Jess Stanton</a></li>
<li>  Project Euler Demo by <a href=\"http://www.xtine.net/\">Christine Cheung</a></li>
<li>  Python Web Frameworks by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/kjam\">Katharine Jarmul</a></li>
<li>  Generators by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/sandymahalo\">Sandy Strong</a></li>
<li>  Ergonomics by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/estherbester\">Esther Nam</a></li>
<li>  The Code Behind PyLadies.com by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/audreyr\">Audrey Roy</a></li>
<li>  Inequality: Stories from the Python &amp; Developer Communities by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tiny_mouse\">Jess Stanton</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, we celebrated over root beer floats. It was interesting and exciting to see that no one wanted to leave at the end! I was thrilled and floating on a cloud, and so were all the other organizers and volunteers.</p>
<p>Thank you to our special out-of-town guests! If there's anything we can do to help you in any way with your local women's developer communities, let us know.</p>

"))) ("First Python Ladies' Night Recap" "<p>On April 16, 2011, a group of 5 local female Python developers got together for the first ever Python ladies' night.</p>
<p>We had wine, sparkling elderflower and ginger waters, vegetable spaghetti, savory meat pies from Porto's bakery, Caesar salad, homemade garlic bread, tea, and tiramisu.</p>
<p>We talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>  Python women's advocacy (mostly!)</li>
<li>  virtualenv</li>
<li>  the mod_wsgi documentation</li>
<li>  Django-based content management systems</li>
<li>  how we each got into Python development</li>
</ul>
<p>And we started plans for a women's Python workshop on May 15, 2011. Details about how to get tickets will be announced this week.</p>
<p>It was an exciting meeting with a lot of positive energy.  Everyone present was passionate about Python women's advocacy and wanted to help increase diversity in the local Python community.</p>
<p>At the end, we went up to the rooftop lounge, where we had a spectacular view of downtown LA.  Some of us relaxed in the jacuzzi, while others hung out and chatted poolside.</p>
