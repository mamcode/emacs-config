Its creators Durex Australia claim it could be the \"future of foreplay\", enabling long-distance lovers to touch and tease each other from halfway across the planet. Or at least have a bit of a cheeky grope.</p><p>The technology made its debut <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7DN3kpl2o\" title=\"\">in a video posted on the company's YouTube page</a> on Wednesday, of a young couple giggling as the man uses the power of the internet to prod his beloved girlfriend in the breast. \"It feels like you're touching me,\" she says, for the benefit of the more sceptical viewer.</p><p>In two accompanying videos, a photogenic pair of designers explain the difference between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6vul95hwOY\" title=\"\">Fundawear</a> and your average pair of vibrating knickers: the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHRpJXRwdXk\" title=\"\">specially created bra and underpants</a> have been fitted with miniature actuators to produce something more like the sensation of touch. There are five of these actuators, the technology used to make mobile phones vibrate, in each cup of the bra, and six more in the pants, with corresponding buttons on the smartphone app.</p><p>Durex is describing Fundawear's combination of touch technology, long-distance control and underwear as \"a world first\". But there are plenty of similar – if quite a bit racier – products on the market. Take <a href=\"http://www.vibease.com/Preorder\" title=\"\">Vibease</a>, for example, a miniature vibrator with its own text and picture-messaging app, launched on Google Play last September.</p><p>Or, for the more adventurous, <a href=\"https://www.lovepalz.com/info.html\" title=\"\">LovePalz</a>, \"the world's first internet-enabled sex toy\", which doesn't have an app but more than makes up for it in brazen sexual realism. The LovePalz kit consists of a pair of devices, one yonic and one phallic, named a Hera and a Zeus. Connect online with them and the devices \"sense your motions and immediately send them real-time to your lover\".</p><p>Even prudish couples keen for more innocent physical contact have options. Last year students at MIT created the <a href=\"http://www.melissakitchow.com/Like-A-Hug\" title=\"\">Like-A-Hug</a> jacket, which inflates to \"hug\" the wearer whenever someone \"likes\" one of their Facebook posts. And in 2006 London-based designers CuteCircuit created an internet-controlled <a href=\"http://cutecircuit.com/time-best-inventions-of-2006-hug-shirt/\" title=\"\">HugShirt</a>, which used special sensors to measure hug strength, skin warmth and heartbeat.</p><p>So is Fundawear a revolution in long-distance loving? Or just a fancy pair of vibro-pants? And will separated lovers really be touch-starved enough to pay money for a long-range boob prodder? Durex Australia reckons so.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gadgets\">Gadgets</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-meltzer\">Tom Meltzer</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Check <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2013/apr/19/best-android-apps-csr-racing-facebook-home\">this week's 20 best Android apps roundup</a>, which was published earlier in the day. Here's this week's comparable iOS selection:</p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-thirty-nine-steps/id632536697?mt=8\">The Thirty-Nine Steps (£4.99)</a></h2><p>Book publisher Faber and digital studio The Story Mechanics are giving John Buchan's famous novel an interactive twist for iPad. It puts you in the position of central character Richard Hannay, exploring scenes, collecting items and experiencing the story in a form somewhere between a book and a game.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cut-the-rope-time-travel/id608899141?mt=8\">Cut the Rope: Time Travel (£0.69 / £1.99)</a></h2><p>Cutesy monster Om Nom has returned with a third Cut the Rope game for Android, with a time-travelling theme as he tries to feed sweets to his ancestors. The action is very similar to the previous games: you're cutting ropes to solve physics-puzzles across six locations, although this time there are two on-screen monsters to feed, not one. The link above is for iPhone, but <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cut-the-rope-time-travel-hd/id608901634?mt=8\">here's the iPad version</a>.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/twitter-music/id625541612?mt=8\">Twitter #music (Free)</a></h2><p>After lots of speculation this month, Twitter has finally launched its standalone music discovery app. It serves up charts of songs that are currently trending on Twitter – as well as those being tweeted by the people you follow – offering iTunes preview clips for most users, but full songs for paying Spotify and Rdio subscribers.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/life-death-in-pompeii-herculaneum/id634907879?mt=8\">Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum HD (£3.99)</a></h2><p>The British Museum is behind this new iOS app based on the Roman cities that were famously buried by a volcano eruption in AD 79. Based on the Museum's exhibition on the subject, the app groups more than 250 objects by street location, with zoomable images and commentary from experts including Mary Beard; and an interactive timeline of the eruption and its aftermath. A <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/life-death-in-pompeii-herculaneum/id634904642?mt=8\">£1.99 non-HD version of the app</a> is also available.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yahoo!-weather/id628677149?mt=8\">Yahoo! Weather (Free)</a></h2><p>iPhone owners already have a preloaded weather app using data from Yahoo, but this standalone app is a big step on in its production quality and features. The app provides forecasts, heat and wind maps and sunrise/sunset times among other features, with the twist that this data is accompanied by full-screen photos from that location, pulled from Yahoo's Flickr photo-sharing service.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hopscotch-hd/id617098629?mt=8\">Hopscotch HD (Free)</a></h2><p>There are a number of apps aiming to help children learn to code – the recent <a href=\"http://www.appsplayground.com/apps/2013/03/27/hakitzu-code-of-the-warrior-ipad-game-teaches-kids-to-code-with-robots/\">Hakitzu: Code of the Warrior</a> and further-back <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/move-turtle.-programming-for/id509013878?mt=8\">Move the Turtle</a> being two examples. Hopscotch HD is another: an iPad app offering a visual programming language for kids to create games and animations, aimed at 8-12 year-olds.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/touchfit-gsp/id612292961?mt=8\">Touchfit: GSP (£4.99)</a></h2><p>Zolmo made its name with millions of downloads of its Jamie Oliver cooking apps. Now it's striking out into fitness, teaming up with mixed martial-arts fighter Georges St-Pierre. The app offers video workout exercises from Georges himself, and promises to adapt its routines based on your progress.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/guardianwitness/id587343125?mt=8\">GuardianWitness (Free)</a></h2><p>Obvious disclosure: this is an app from the Apps Blog's parent company Guardian News & Media. Described as \"the home of user-generated content on the Guardian\", the app helps readers contribute to live news stories, suggest other stories and features, and enter competitions. Submissions can include text, photos and/or videos.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fish-out-of-water!/id578467798?mt=8\">Fish Out of Water! (£0.69)</a></h2><p>I was up until midnight playing this last night, after having downloaded it for a quick play around 11pm. That's a guide to the addictive qualities of this latest game from Halfbrick Studios – the developer behind Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride. You skim colourful fish across the ocean, get rated by crabs, and unlock gems to build power-ups. Sounds strange, plays marvellously.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-animators-survival-kit/id627438690?mt=8\">The Animator's Survival Kit (£24.49)</a></h2><p>You're most likely to know Richard Williams from his work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, but he's also been delivering masterclasses for animators for a couple of decades now, teaching them the tricks of his trade. This iPad app from Faber includes content from his The Animator's Survival Kit book, but also animated examples from its DVD, video explanations from Williams himself, and some of his unreleased work. It may look expensive, but it's well worth the price for anyone serious about their animation.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yahoo!-mail/id577586159?mt=8\">Yahoo! Mail (Free)</a></h2><p>The Yahoo! Mail app isn't new for smartphones, but the company has released a new version that's optimised for tablets. It works with the Yahoo! Mail service, with support for multiple accounts, photo attachments and notifications for new messages.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/roger-eberts-film-festival/id634019760?mt=8\">Roger Ebert's Film Festival (£4.99)</a></h2><p>There was an outpouring of praise and warmth when film critic Roger Ebert died earlier this month. Now, in time for the 15th anniversary of his Ebertfest film festival, there's an app to celebrate its history. Expect more than 100 hours of Q&As and videos, browsable programmes, Ebert's own reviews of films screened during the festivals, and trailers – all with AirPlay support for Apple TV owners.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wee-you-things/id631615431?mt=8\">Wee You-Things (£1.99)</a></h2><p>Children's app developer Wee Society has produced this colourful collection of characters to teach children to celebrate their differences rather than feel ashamed of them. It's all about \"you-things – those little and big things that, together, make you special\", with examples including Little Dot who gets scared a lot, Ruth with a purple tooth and Brad with two dads. The artwork is lovely, and music comes from indie band Rabbit.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wagners-ring-cycle/id621230119?mt=8\">Wagner's Ring Cycle (£5.99)</a></h2><p>This iPad app comes from classical music label Naxos: a companion app for Wagner's Ring Cycle operas, outlining their main \"leitmotifs\" with 130 audio clips, eight full tracks, and a mixture of biographical info on Wagner and plot summaries of the four operas.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/id619517698?mt=8\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Rooftop Run (£1.49)</a></h2><p>Cowabunga! Booyakasha! Eat My Shorts, Man! Oh wait, that's the other one. Yes, it's not just The Simpsons that's lasted as a TV brand: the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been cavorting on TV screens recently like it's 1989, and now there's an official iOS game. Released by Nickelodeon, it's a \"combat runner\" game set on the rooftops of New York. In-app purchases of up to £34.99 pay for additional virtual coins – somewhat surprising, given the young fanbase and the initial £1.49 download.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bookworm-heroes/id567254043?mt=8\">Bookworm Heroes (Free)</a></h2><p>Here's a fully-freemium game from EA's PopCap division – the home of Bejeweled and Plants Vs. Zombies. This is actually a new version of word-game Bookworm, reconfigured for the free-to-play market. You build words from letter tiles against Facebook friends, while earning or buying virtual coins to boost your prospects.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/osom-market/id577125533?mt=8\">Osom Market (Free)</a></h2><p>Swedish startup Osom is pitching its new app as \"Instagram meets Craigslist\": an app for buying and selling clothes, shoes and other items, with filtered photos and hashtags helping show off the items and make them findable. Vintage stores are expected to be among its sellers.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/calendo-event-discovery/id571304515?mt=8\">Calendo Event Discovery (Free)</a></h2><p>Calendo styles itself as a \"smart recommendation engine\" for events, based on your Facebook friends, location and existing tastes. The app wants users top open it regularly to see what events are coming up, with notifications for notable ones, and sharing features.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yowindow/id606193225?mt=8\">YoWindow (£0.69)</a></h2><p>One more weather app this week (hopefully) just in time for spring to finally get underway. The schtick here is that the app shows you a \"living landscape\" representing the weather in your chosen location, which you can swipe through to see how it's forecast to change.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-london-coffee-guide/id632970327?mt=8\">The London Coffee Guide (£1.99)</a></h2><p>Finally, something for caffeine-lovers in the capital, with this appy guide to more than 130 independent \"coffee venues\" in London – cafes, but also carts, kiosks and roasteries.

Mail and more</p><p>It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets.</p><p>It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day. For now, read on for this week's Android selection.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.csrracing\">CSR Racing (Free)</a></h2><p>Freemium drag-racing game CSR Racing was one of the biggest iOS hits of 2012, but now it's roared onto Android. The game sees you buying, upgrading and racing a range of cars from Audi, BMW and other manufacturers, with an emphasis on customisation – and in-app purchases used to fund the action.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home\">Facebook Home (Free)</a></h2><p>Released on Google Play just after last week's Android roundup, Facebook Home is the social network's launcher for taking over Android smartphone homescreens, putting friends' updates and photos front and centre. For now, it's officially only available for devices like the Galaxy S III, Galaxy Note II, HTC One X and HTC One X+, with more to follow.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptolab.timetravel.paid.google\">Cut the Rope: Time Travel (£0.62)</a></h2><p>Cutesy monster Om Nom has returned with a third Cut the Rope game for Android, with a time-travelling theme as he tries to feed sweets to his ancestors. The action is very similar to the previous games: you're cutting ropes to solve physics-puzzles across six locations, although this time there are two on-screen monsters to feed, not one.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guardian.witness\">GuardianWitness (Free)</a></h2><p>Obvious disclosure: this is an app from the Apps Blog's parent company Guardian News & Media. Described as \"the home of user-generated content on the Guardian\", the app helps readers contribute to live news stories, suggest other stories and features, and enter competitions. Submissions can include text, photos and/or videos.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.glass.companion\">MyGlass (Free)</a></h2><p>MyGlass has a small niche audience for now: early recipients of the first Google Glass eyewear prototypes. The app enables them to configure and manage the device from their Android phones. More than 1,000 people have already downloaded the app, as the first devices are sent out.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftD4HM\">Dungeon Hunter 4 (Free)</a></h2><p>Gameloft's dungeon-crawling adventure is back for its fourth iteration, and like the third instalment, this is freemium. Buying gems in-app beefs up your prospects as you wander through sprawling environments laying waste to enemies.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lifeisbetteron.com&hl=en\">Libon (Free)</a></h2><p>Libon is the work of Orange, promising \"visual voicemail that does it all\". That means free Voice-over-IP calls and instant messaging, with a voicemail feature to handle calls when you're not available to answer, with email notifications and text messages.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.mail\">Yahoo! Mail (Free)</a></h2><p>The Yahoo! Mail app isn't new for Android smartphones, but the company has released a new version that's optimised for tablets. It works with the Yahoo! Mail service, with support for multiple accounts, photo attachments and notifications for new messages.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripomatic\">Tripomatic City Guides & Maps (Free)</a></h2><p>Tripomatic is one of the startups trying to build a business out of personalised travel guide apps. This is its first Android release, providing guides to more than 40k attractions in 300 holiday spots around the world. The idea: you can plan an itinerary – using the app or the Tripomatic website – then access it on the go, and also add your own places if desired.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sticksports.spl\">Stick Cricket Premier League (Free)</a></h2><p>As the Indian Premier League cricket league gets underway in its sixth season, there's a marvellous spin-off game from Stick Sports that lets you build and manage a squad as well as slogging it out on the pitch. It's based on the existing Stick Cricket game, with similarly addictive gameplay.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cobra.ibomber\">iBomber (Free)</a></h2><p>Arcade bombing game (as in bomber pilots and planes, obviously) iBomber was great fun on iOS when it came out in 2009. Now it's finally available on Android. The game sees you flying missions over the Pacific Ocean in 1943, with 26 to complete, and social features to compare your skills with friends.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orsaveit.orsaveit\">OrSaveIt (Free)</a></h2><p>OrSaveIt is described as an \"impulse savings app\" – something designed to help you save money for specific goals or treats. \"Choose a picture of your saving goal, set your target amount and then use the impulse save icons to make saves, on the go,\" explains its Google Play listing.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.backflipstudios.android.papertoss2\">Paper Toss 2.0 (Free)</a></h2><p>It's a mark of the Paper Toss series' popularity that a few days after launch, this sequel is already past the 500k downloads mark on Android. The core gameplay is the same as its predecessor: chucking paper balls into an office wastepaper basket with flicks of your finger. This time round, bananas, grenades and co-workers are flung into the mix.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podfy.android\">PODFY - Podcast Player (£1.96)</a></h2><p>PODFY styles itself as a \"cloud podcast player\" which runs across smartphones, tablets and PC. It keeps tracks of the podcasts you've downloaded, and enables you to sort them into playlists – with automation to lighten the load of compiling them.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synthmedia.crunchd&hl=en_GB\">Crunchd (Free)</a></h2><p>Crunchd is an app for people who grow, cook and eat their own food, aiming to connect them with one another in local communities. The idea is that they swap advice, keep diaries of what they're growing and eating, upload photos and trade excess produce with one another.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joysoft.visual.calendar\">Visual Calendar for Tablets (£3.91)</a></h2><p>Visual Calendar is certainly ambitious: an app that wants to \"change the way you plan your life\". If you think that means a slick-looking calendar app with neat coloured icons, take a bow. \"Think Mind Map for your project turned into actual tasks and dates, or events and appointments from your organizer presented in an intuitive, task-oriented way,\" explains its Google Play listing. Well worth a look.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iamvegend.gp\">I Am Vegend – Zombiegeddon (Free)</a></h2><p>Birds, pigs and zombies... together at last! Android game I Am Vegend has its tongue in its cheek across its 45 missions, for a game that's less a parody and more a \"mind-blowing travesty of mobile game hits\". It looks good fun though.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motion.firstwoodwar.strategy.castle.tower.defense\">First Wood War (Free)</a></h2><p>First Wood War looks like a game with plenty to chew on for more serious gamers: a real-time strategy game with a player-versus-player online mode, impressive graphics and more than 20 battle maps to explore in its solo mode. It's all set in the woods, which brings us neatly on to...</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dualboot.apps.forest\">Forest HD (£0.99)</a></h2><p>This sits somewhere between an app and a live wallpaper: an atmospheric virtual forest to explore, peering at birds, deer and plants, with add-on packs offering butterflies, babbling brooks and customisation.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haave.measurebook\">Measure Book (£1.95)</a></h2><p>Finally, Measure Book, a productivity app for people making home improvements.

The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/16/measles-outbreak-5000-children-risk\" title=\"\">city is at the centre of a major outbreak </a>of the highly infectious disease, and the fatality – if the cause is confirmed – would be the first UK death from measles since 2008. Seventy-seven people have needed hospital treatment during the outbreak.</p><p>More than 800 cases, many among 10- to 18-year-olds, have been reported since November, and numbers are rising steadily and spreading north from the south of the country despite health authorities organising special immunisation clinics at hospitals and schools.</p><p>Health officials have repeatedly warned parents of children who had not had the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to arrange vaccination for them \"as a matter of urgency\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/17/measles-outbreak-mmr-jab\" title=\"\">One local head told the Guardian this week</a> that he was concerned by a lack of response by some parents to a special clinic at his school.</p><p>Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said on Friday it was aware of a death being investigated by the Swansea coroner. She added: \"A diagnosis of measles has not yet been confirmed. Testing the deceased for measles is forming part of the investigations being overseen by the coroner.</p><p>\"My sympathies are with the family at such a tragic time. Whatever the cause of death in this case, we should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths in Wales. Measles is a potentially fatal disease and around one in every 1,000 people who contracts measles in developed countries will die.\"</p><p>She added that those not fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR were likely to catch measles, which is highly contagious.</p><p>\"We know that there are unprotected people in all age groups but we have particular concerns about the 10-to-18 age group,\" she said. \"The MMR vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organisation, UK Department of Health and Public Health Wales as the most effective and safe way to protect children against measles.</p><p>\"The alarming numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease in Wales illustrates how vital it is for parents to get their children vaccinated. Symptoms of measles include fever, cold-like symptoms, fatigue, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red-brown rash that appears a few days into the illness. Anyone who thinks they or their child may have measles should speak to their GP immediately.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health\">Health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/infectiousdiseases\">Infectious diseases</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mmr\">MMR</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales\">Wales</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/vaccines\">Vaccines and immunisation</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle\">James Meikle</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The most prominent of these suggests that the US government set it up as a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag\" title=\"\">false flag</a>\" operation – an attack whereby a government stages a secret operation and acts as the victim while attacking its own people. In this case, the false flag attack was supposedly executed to scare citizens into handing over more control to authorities. Arguments such as this are often described as \"conspiracy theories\" that explain significant events as the malevolent actions of governments or other powerful and secretive groups.</p><p></p><p>Explanations for the Boston marathon attack are not unique in this respect. Over the years, accusations of conspiracy have surrounded many significant political and social events, and recent examples include the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting_conspiracy_theories\" title=\"\">Sandy Hook elementary school shootings</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/texas-explosion-fertiliser-plant-blast\" title=\"\">explosion of the fertilizer plant in Waco, Texas</a>. The bottom line is that the official account of events – if one exists – should always be questioned because governments in general cannot be trusted to tell people the truth.</p><p></p><p>Researchers are beginning to understand more about the psychological factors that attract people to these alternative theories. For example, people who are less trusting of others, or those who feel less powerful, tend to show greater support for conspiracy theories. Such theories are said to help people to come to terms with events in their lives that they cannot control.</p><p></p><p>Generally too, people tend to prefer \"big explanations\" for \"big events\", where simple or mundane explanations do not seem adequate. Many people are also likely to believe in conspiracy theories that contradict each other, as long as they cohere with the general idea that some sort of conspiracy took place, or that important facts were being covered up. This explains why a plethora of mutually inconsistent conspiracy theories emerge for the same event, and appear to live together in cheerful harmony in the blogosphere.</p><p></p><p>For example, for many people, believing that Osama bin Laden was already dead at the time of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/death-osama-bin-laden-us\" title=\"\">raid in Abbottabad</a> is no barrier to believing that he is still alive somewhere. Even when official accounts are available, conspiracy theories have a unique appeal for some, since they appeal to particular psychological needs.</p><p></p><p>Another reason for their popularity and endurance is undoubtedly the emergence of digital communication media. Recent events highlight how the internet and online social networks shape people's understanding of events like the Boston marathon attack. Within an hour of the bombings, cyberspace was buzzing with suspicion and speculations of conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>People posted pictures of sinister-looking individuals in the crowds; others claimed that a memorial website had already been set up for the victims before the bombings had even happened, and that this was \"proof\" of the false flag attack theory. The emergence of these explanations is itself interesting enough, but the speed with which they have proliferated throughout cyberspace is quite remarkable. At the time of writing this article, a Google search for \"Boston marathon conspiracy\" revealed 291,000,000 hits.</p><p>The internet allows people to express and share ideas quickly, and with relatively little accountability. In the case of important social events, people naturally want explanations straight away, and even though they may not have a preference for conspiracy theories over official accounts, the latter take a longer time to \"cook\". They are often absent or incomplete for a while, or sometimes forever. Libel laws and editorial control also hold back official explanations. Rapidly available conspiracy theories therefore enjoy the advantage of being immediately visible and open for discussion without delay.</p><p>This is not to say that the immediacy of digital communication is always a bad thing in situations such as this. After the Boston marathon attack <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-explosions-reveal-twitter\" title=\"\">many people used Twitter</a> to find out what happened and to help them plan what to do next. Sharing information on the internet may also be empowering because it enables people to generate and discuss events rather than having explanations simply handed down by officialdom. However, relying on the internet and social networks for information can become a problem when people are unable to separate fact from fiction and good sources from bad. Research shows that not everyone possesses the digital literacy, or fluency, to differentiate a reliable from an unreliable source.</p><p>Some savvy internet users understand the power of digital media in arousing suspicion and mistrust among less digitally literate audiences. One such person purchased the domain name, <a href=\"http://bostonmarathonconspiracies.com/\" title=\"\">BostonMarathonConspiracies.com</a> writing the following text for visitors to the site:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>I bought this domain to keep some conspiracy theory kook from owning it.<br />Please keep the victims of this event and their families in your thoughts.<br /></blockquote></p><p></p><p>This person seems to suggest that it is irresponsible to frivolously speculate about the causes of events that involve people in tragic circumstances. But on the other hand, advocates of conspiracy theories would argue that this is a blatant attempt to shut down people's democratic right to discuss the causes of events that affect society as a whole. We do not yet know what really happened at this year's Boston marathon or why it happened. Until we do (and probably after we do), various theories will continue to emerge and evolve.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media\">Digital media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karen-douglas\">Karen Douglas</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ofsted figures show that since August up to 243,400 children were being cared for by nurseries, childminders and pre-schools that were not considered good.</p><p>More than two-fifths of early years educators were judged no better than satisfactory at their last two inspections, and more than one in 10 had dropped a grade, according to the watchdog's annual report in November.</p><p>Under Wilshaw's proposals, to be published for consultation on Friday, Ofsted will consider only a rating of good or outstanding to be acceptable from September. The satisfactory judgment will be scrapped and replaced by \"requires improvement\", a change already implemented at school inspections in England.</p><p>Nurseries and pre-schools that are judged to require improvement will face more inspections and have up to four years to raise standards. If they are not rated good after two inspections they are expected to be considered inadequate.</p><p>Inadequate nurseries and pre-schools that fail to improve could face having their registration cancelled, in effect closing them.</p><p>Wilshaw was expected to say: \"Parents, whatever their circumstances, want their children to access good-quality childcare and get a good early education that sets them up well for statutory schooling. Yet too many providers are not good enough, particularly in the most deprived areas. We must be tougher on weak settings.</p><p>\"From September 2013, nurseries and pre-schools judged less than good will need to improve rapidly. I want the new designation of 'requires improvement' to act as a catalyst to get all early years providers to good as soon as possible.</p><p>\"We'll encourage providers that are good or outstanding to support weaker settings. We know that the best schools are joining forces and we anticipate that this will happen in the early years.\"</p><p>Ofsted said it was considering plans for inspection of childminder agencies, and had not yet made proposals about early re-inspection of childminders.</p><p>In September, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/17/ofsted-satisfactory-rating-scrapped\" title=\"\">satisfactory rating used by inspectors for school inspections was scrapped</a>, and replaced with requires improvement, a move Ofsted said was intended to raise standards.</p><p>Schools judged to require improvement at two consecutive inspections, and which were still not providing a good education at the third, were more likely be placed in special measures.</p><p>The move caused upset among headteachers as it was likely to leave more schools in special measures.</p><p>The consultation on the latest proposals closes on 24 May.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/ofsted\">Ofsted</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/childcare\">Childcare</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children\">Children</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools\">Schools</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/earlyyearseducation\">Early years education</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Could it help to ease the UK housing crisis?</p><p>\"Developer,\" the late architect <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2013/apr/10/paolo-soleri-architect-dies-93\">Paolo Soleri</a> used to say, \"starts with 'D', like 'devil' and 'demon'.\"</p><p>While Soleri was unique in many of his cosmic pronouncements, his suspicion of developers is not so uncommon amongst fellow architects. Bloated fat cats, squeezing budgets while maximising profit, they are often seen as inconvenient obstacles between the design vision and future users of the building.</p><p>House builders are singled out as the worst offenders, generally not using architects at all, while \"conning the public into buying hugely overpriced rubbish, the architectural equivalent of the turkey twizzler,\" as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/16/social-housing-standards-rabbit-hutch\">Alain de Botton recently put it to the Guardian</a>. In an ideal world, couldn't we cut developers out of the process all together?</p><p>That is one solution that architects in Argentina have been exploring for some time, as researcher <a href=\"http://www.eliasredstone.com/\">Elias Redstone</a> discovered on his travels around Buenos Aires, as part of the British Council's <a href=\"http://www.venicetakeaway.com/\">Venice Takeaway</a> initiative, exploring ideas to change British architecture – which will be <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/Fideicomiso!PuttingArchitectureattheHeartofHousing.aspx/\">debated at the RIBA on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>\"There is a different culture of architects acting as entrepreneurs in Argentina,\" says Redstone. \"It is very common for them to work directly with a group of future residents as investors, thanks to a form of legal agreement called fideicomiso.\"</p><p>A kind of fiduciary contract based on trust, fideicomiso allows the architect to take on the risk of a development, using the residents' collective assets to buy the land, fund the project and deliver the scheme. It enjoyed a resurgence as a model of house building after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/dec/20/argentina1\">2001 banking crisis</a>, when many people withdrew their savings from collapsing coffers and looked for somewhere more stable to park their cash. </p><p>\"It was also a product of necessity for architects,\" says Redstone. \"There weren't many developers around to commission buildings, particularly from smaller practices, so they decided to go out and do it themselves, constructing small apartment blocks for groups of friends and family.\"</p><p>Across Buenos Aires on leftover plots in traditionally low value areas, these self-built blocks, usually of around eight apartments, have become a common sight. The cumulative effect of these interventions has led to the revitalisation of neighbourhoods, such as Palermo, Caballito, Nuñez and Barrio Norte.</p><p>The standard plot widths of 8.6m, along with specific neighbourhood planning codes, define the permitted development and, in turn, the value of the property, making it easier for architects to propose a scheme and a business plan for any given site. Resident investors, meanwhile, can enter the project at different stages, with the rates increasing as the scheme develops: early investors – taking a bigger risk – receive a greater return. Overall, buying an apartment in this way is thought to be 20–30 percent cheaper than on the open market, and with the added benefit of being able to have a say in the final design.</p><p>So could the model work in Britain and help to moderate our hyper inflated, developer-dominated market, increasing the supply of much needed urban housing? Architect <a href=\"http://www.davidkohn.co.uk/\">David Kohn</a> doesn't see why not.</p><p>\"From looking at housing in London, it has become clear that shortage of land is not the problem,\" says Kohn. \"Instead it is the shortage of developers willing to build out the planning permissions that they already have, because they're not deemed to be sufficiently profitable.\"</p><p>Kohn, who is teaching a <a href=\"http://www.thecass.com/courses/studios-units/architecture/professional-diploma/unit-5-2012-13-brief\">diploma unit</a> looking at the potentials for self-build on the Olympic site (<a href=\"http://www.londonlegacy.co.uk/custom-build/\">part of an initiative recently announced by the London Legacy Development Corporation</a>) argues that this model of co-housing could fill the gap.</p><p>\"Self-build isn't the whole answer, but it could be a way of kick-starting the process,\" he says, seeing the co-housing model as a complementary part of a wider ecosystem, working alongside conventional development. \"The end-users provide the capital, reducing the developer's outlay, and once the project has taken root it will help to increase the wider value of the site.\"</p><p>While self-build has traditionally been associated with the Grand Designs vision of suburban dream homes for wealthy middle-class clients, Kohn is interested in how the urban nature of Argentina's fideicomiso schemes can inform work in London.</p><p>\"There are whole self-build towns on the continent that look as if someone has emptied a toy box on the floor,\" he says, bringing to mind the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/nov/25/self-build-go-dutch\">whimsical forms of Almere in the Netherlands</a>. \"But what works for suburbia won't necessarily make a good piece of city. I'm interested in how you make public space when everyone's doing their own thing.\"</p><p>• Join the debate at the RIBA on Tuesday 23 April at <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/WhatsOn/Talks/Events/2013/Spring/Fideicomiso!PuttingArchitectureattheHeartofHousing.aspx/\">Fideicomiso!

Join our experts from midday on <strong>Monday 22 April</strong></p><p>Since the government slashed affordable housing grants by 60% in 2010, many housing providers have diversified into new commercial areas to make up for the funding shortfall. Social landlords have channelled their skills into private lettings, homes for outright sale and property management as well as more unexpected ventures <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2013/jan/08/housing-acquisition-dc-leisure-diversification\" title=\"\">such as leisure firms</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2012/aug/30/social-housing-dangers-over-diversification\" title=\"\">commercial recruitment companies</a>.</p><p>One of the biggest property boom areas over the last decade has been student accommodation. With universities unable to keep up with the rapid increase in the number of students, private sector firms have muscled in to take advantage, competing over quality and price. The popularity of higher education and an influx of international students, particularly in London, have created a competitive marketplace that many social landlords will feel is well suited to their business.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2012/aug/30/social-housing-dangers-over-diversification\" title=\"\">dangers of diversification</a> are myriad, as <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/cosmopolitan-clock-ticking-on-rescue/6525374.article\" title=\"\">troubled Cosmopolitan Housing Group</a> revealed. The northern landlord, with nearly 14,000 properties, teetered on the brink of bankruptcy after a series of ill-fated investments in student accommodation left its core social housing business at risk. A <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/regulation/cosmo-and-sanctuary-strike-historic-deal/6526344.article\" title=\"\">late takeover by Sanctuary</a>, the UK's largest social landlord, eventually rescued the group – but not before setting alarms ringing across the housing sector.</p><p>Yet a number of housing associations are successful players in the student housing market. So how safe is student accommodation as a diversification opportunity, and how can housing associations make it work for them? How does the management of student accommodation differ from general housing – and how is it helping to fund affordable housing?</p><p>Join our expert panel from <strong>midday on Monday 15 April </strong>to ask your questions and find out more.</p><p><strong>Panel TBA</strong></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and live online debate</strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/housing-management\">Housing management</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/policy\">Policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/finance\">Finance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/development\">Development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/practice\">Practice</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing\">Housing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities\">Communities</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/liam-kelly\">Liam Kelly</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Manchester, Nottingham and Coventry are not far behind.</p><p>\"Buy to let remains a good investment for those looking for above-average returns. Twenty-three of the top 50 areas offer yields above 5%, significantly more than is available from more traditional savings options,\" said Peter Dockar, head of mortgages at HSBC. \"However, it is clear there is a fine line between a property in a desirable area, the rents that can be achieved and the returns that can be yielded.\"</p><p>This looks to be the case in London – the capital did not make it into the top 10 best places for buy-to-let. Due to its high property prices, rental yields are \"relatively modest\", according to HSBC.</p><p>The best returns come from the borough of Southwark, home to the Shard, Southwark cathedral and foodie favourite Borough market. The average property price there is £401,405 and the average rent £2,058, giving a rental yield of just over 6%. In well-heeled Kensington and Chelsea, where the average property price is just over £1m, rental yields are the lowest for the capital at just over 3%.</p><p>While landlords in London may not feel like they are reaping the rewards of their investments, their tenants are suffering from record high rents as an increased demand for rental property pushes up prices.</p><p>Rents in the capital have hit a new high of a typical £1,106 a month, according to LSL Property Services, which owns national lettings agency chains Your Move and Reeds Rains. The capital has experienced the fastest annual rent increases in the country, making the average property £81 more expensive than a year ago.</p><p>\"Rents in London are red-hot,\" said David Newnes, director of LSL. \"In spite of the unseasonal weather the rental market has gained some ground.

What can Labour do?</p><p>The introduction in London this month of the government's new £26,000 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/benefits-cap-not-address-affordable-housing-crisis\" title=\"\">benefit cap</a> has generated predictably heated debate. <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/q05jmbsel3/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-050413.pdf\" title=\"\">Opinion polls</a> show that the policy is popular because the public believe it is fair. Ministers know this and to push the policy they have been willing to walk up to the line marked \"misuse of statistics\" and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/conservative-claims-about-benefits-not-spin\" title=\"\">step across it</a>. Labour has been forced into a defensive posture, caught between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla\" title=\"\">Scylla</a> of its compassion and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis\" title=\"\">Charybdis</a> of brute politics.</p><p>To capitalise on his political advantage, George Osborne is planning a new, super-sized benefit cap, to cover entire swaths of welfare spending rather than individuals. In the last budget he announced that:</p><p><blockquote>\"We will now introduce a new limit on a significant proportion of annually managed expenditure. It will be set out in a way that allows the automatic stabilisers to operate but will bring real control to areas of public spending that had been out of control.\" </blockquote></p><p>Annually managed expenditure (AME) is roughly half of all public spending, covering state pensions, working-age benefits and debt interest. The Social Market Foundation has produced an <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/files/4713/6537/6131/20130407_AME_analysis.pdf\" title=\"\">excellent research note</a> on what has driven the recent increase in AME spending and how it will evolve in future years. It <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/09/osborne-cap-benefits-bill-pensioners\" title=\"\">shows that</a> with more people being paid generously uprated pensions and with rising government debt interest payments, any cap on a significant proportion of the AME budget in the future will fall on working-age benefits&nbsp;– tax credits, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance and so on&nbsp;– as it has done in this parliament.</p><p>In June, when the chancellor announces future government spending plans, he will claim that recent growth in the AME budget has been as much structural as cyclical, driven by political choices, not social need, and he will attack Labour for increasing spending on tax credits and welfare largesse. This will allow him to say that new limits to benefit spending will not prevent social security being there for people when they lose their jobs, but instead bear down on the undeserving. He will probably define his benefit cap in cyclically adjusted terms and set out a rolling three-year spending rule for AME, so that it functions more like a departmental spending allocation total.</p><p>Osborne's real goal is a political one. He wants to make explicit provision for cutting working-age welfare in the next parliament. His coalition partners can prevent him identifying specific welfare cuts, but as chancellor he is well within his rights to set an overall benefit spending total, and so to force others to accept it as the new framework for political debate. If the other parties resist the new welfare envelope, he can ask them which taxes they will increase or which services they will cut in order to maintain benefits. In the Conservative manifesto, he can flesh this out with proposals for specific cuts. Rather than set pensioners against the working-age population, as many have assumed he will do, the chancellor instead will set the protection of spending on valued public services like the NHS against welfare spending.</p><p>It is deeply cynical politics, of course, and it may get harder as the cuts bite – we shall see. But unless Labour can set out a new strategic direction for the welfare state and <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/12/welfare-debate-only-just-warming\" title=\"\">lay out how its own policies</a> would bring down the welfare bill it will be forced to argue against the chancellor on terms that the latter has chosen.</p><p>What might Labour do? It could acknowledge that the key issue is not that AME rises during a recession but that it doesn't come down by enough when the economy is strong, because of underlying drivers like rising rents, high childcare costs, low wages and disguised unemployment among those on inactive benefits. It could therefore argue for shifting more spending out of AME cash benefits and into pro-employment services – for example, from childcare tax credits to childcare services in children's centres, or from housing benefit into building homes. Additionally, it could strengthen the impact of the actual automatic stabilisers.</p><p>For example, it could build in a cut to employer national insurance contributions if unemployment is high, offering three months of <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/7775/national-salary-insurance-reforming-the-welfare-state-to-provide-real-protection\" title=\"\">national salary insurance</a> to temporarily unemployed workers, giving extra funding to JobCentre Plus if the claimant count spikes, and amending the payment schedule of the work programme to take account of the cycle so it becomes a true measure of provider performance. Most importantly perhaps, it could develop new fiscal rules that commit to reducing welfare spending if growth is strong, so that AME falls in the upswing, and lay out its own employment plans to give credibility to those rules.</p><p>All of this is urgent. The chancellor will set out his plans in a matter of months. As it stands, it is his benefit cap mk II that will set the terms of the welfare debate for the next election.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits\">Benefits</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare\">Welfare</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy\">Economic policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour\">Labour</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance\">Public finance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts\">Public sector cuts</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/pearce-nick\">Nick Pearce</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The changes will be partly due to \"customer feedback\", Klein said.</p><p></p><p>Earlier in April the research companies Gartner and IDC reported a slump in PC sales, with IDC blaming it in part on Windows 8 itself because it said the new interface was puzzling would-be buyers.</p><p></p><p>Yet Microsoft shrugged off a 14% slump in PC sales during the first quarter to report net income of $6.1bn (£3.9m), up 18% from $5.1bn a year ago, beating analysts' forecasts – though those had been trimmed last month in expectations that the poor computer shipments would have a deeper impact.</p><p></p><p>However the company did not release any figures for licence sales of Windows 8 – a figure that some had expected to hear. The last update on that came back in January, when it said it has sold 60m – though the majority of those would be to manufacturers who bundle Windows with new machines.</p><p></p><p>In adjusted figures, allowing for a $733m fine from the European Commission for briefly failing to offer a choice on browsers, and $1.1bn of \"deferred\" Windows revenue, overall revenues would have risen by 8%.</p><p></p><p>The \"deferred revenue\" came from a $15 upgrade offer to Windows 8 on Windows 7 PCs that were bought after 2 June: accounting rules meant Mcirosoft couldn't record the full value of those licences until the offers were either redeemed or expired. That meant that in the recent quarter it added that deferred revenue to its figures, for a huge boost.</p><p></p><p>At the company's largest division, Business, revenue rose 8% from a year ago to $6.3bn. The increase was 5% adjusting for upgrade offers for the new Office suite.</p><p></p><p>But the story for the Windows division would be less rosy. Including the deferrals, revenues rose from $4.63bn to $5.70bn, up 23%. But spreading the $1.1bn over the nine-month period since 2 June, and comparing it with the same period from 2011/12, revenues were up just 4% for a period including two quarters of the launch of a new version of Windows – usually a driver of growth.</p><p></p><p>Microsoft is trying to extend its software into smartphones and tablets as consumers turn away from PCs, the foundation of its empire.

As well as trying to secure unwarranted changes to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/15/planning-reforms- floodgates-unsuitable-extensions\" title=\"\">planning rules</a>, the government is imposing ministerial control over council publishing and has admitted it has abandoned any monitoring of Whitehall departments' progress towards localising powers.</p><p>The proposals to give a cabinet minister power to dictate how often an individual council can publish a newsletter or paper and what it can say are contained in the consultation document on plans to give legal force to the Department for Communities and Local Government's <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-code-of- practice-for-local-authority-publicity\" title=\"\">Publicity Code</a>.</p><p>The code pursues communities secretary Eric Pickles' obsession with stamping out \"town hall Pravdas\" (no one can fault his ability to find the eye-catching phrase).</p><p>It stipulates that town and parish councils should publish no more than once a month and other councils no more than quarterly. It also warns against using council publications as vehicles for political propaganda.</p><p>As governments tend to do when they wish to impose controls, an extreme example is proffered as justification. In this case it is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/society-of-editors\" title=\"\">Tower Hamlets council</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">East London Advertiser</a> has been battling the authority for many years over the publication of its weekly East End Life paper, while in January broadcasting regulator Ofcom <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/ obb222/obb222.pdf\" title=\"\">castigated</a> five East End TV channels for breaching strict rules controlling party political advertising after airing an advertisement promoting Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman.</p><p>The consultation paper on enforcing the code is billed as \"protecting the independent press from unfair competition\". Yet, despite much bluster on the issue from the <a href=\"http://www.newspapersoc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Newspaper Society</a>, the communities and local government select committee <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmcomloc/ 666/666.pdf\" title=\"\">concluded in a 2011 report</a> that there was \"very scant evidence\" of council publications hurting local newspaper advertising or sales.</p><p>Local Government Association leader Sir Merrick Cockell, clearly riled by the government's plans, said the \"<a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/ 10171/3951358/NEWS-TEMPLATE\" title=\"\">unnecessary and disproportionate</a>\" proposals would \"fly in the face of local democracy and the government's declared preference for localism\".</p><p>Pickles' willingness to consider local government's views can be judged by the fact that the four-week consultation is being run through the period of purdah in the run-up to the local elections.</p><p>The implications of this change are far-reaching and oppressive. It gives the communities secretary the authority to personally control and even censor individual council publications, reminiscent of the powers the Lord Chamberlain used to wield over theatres. Giving the existing publicity code more force is unnecessary. Councils have long understood the public's intolerance of \"propaganda on the rates\", and governments of all hues are in no position to lecture local authorities on the evils of using taxpayer-funded communications for political ends.</p><p>Like managers' salaries and councillors' pensions, Pickles' histrionics over council publicity have yet again demonstrated his aptitude for picking an irrelevant distraction and making a story out of it. Of all the issues facing local government, it is difficult to imagine one less worthy of parliamentary time or less important to local communities.</p><p>Among all the cynical pretence by ministers of supporting localism, Greg Clark, who became financial secretary to the Treasury after holding the now defunct post of minister for decentralisation, stands out as someone who passionately believes in it and keeps arguing its cause. His approach to <a href=\"http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/city-deals\" title=\"\">city deals</a> and his willingness to listen to local authorities is a role model for others.</p><p>In his report for prime minister David Cameron on departmental <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/ government/publications/decentralisation-an-assessment-of-progress\" title=\"\">progress towards decentralisation</a>, released in December, Clark recommended that the government publish an assessment annually and debate it in parliament. But in <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=12956\" title=\"\">evidence</a> to the communities and local government select committee this week, DCLG minister Don Foster had to admit that will not happen.</p><p>The government could never allow its progress on localism to be subjected to such close scrutiny. It would expose the failure of numerous departments – notably Work and Pensions, Business, Innovation and Skills, and Education – to match the rhetoric. The harm done to everything from improving schools and building affordable homes to getting people into jobs and supporting local businesses would be apparent.</p><p>So Pickles will carry on playing his trivial games and opportunities for local government to fulfil its potential will continue to be missed. It could be so much better than this.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

So why, she asks, aren't institutions doing more to support their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students?</p><p>It's a question that will be debated on Friday during the annual <a href=\"http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/ents/event/586/\" title=\"\">NUS LGBT campaign conference</a>. The three-day event in Manchester will see members thrash out an agreement on what campaigns the union will fight for over the next year.</p><p>Among the long list of <a href=\"http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/asset/Event/6001/LGBT_2013_CD7_Motionsandamendments_Priority_Onlinev2.pdf\" title=\"\">topics tabled for discussion</a> are motions on tackling bullying and hate crime, protection for LGBT students studying abroad and understanding the specific needs of LGBT mature students.</p><p>But Finn says the issue that needs addressing most urgently is the invisibility of LGBT students.</p><p>Unlike other groups, LGBT people remain unaccounted for in higher education because their numbers are not recorded by universities. This means it's difficult to measure how many students are being affected by prejudice and discrimination.</p><p>While homophobia and transphobia remain endemic on all campuses, says Finn, universities still do not recognise LGBT students as a target group in terms of access and retention.</p><p>\"There's this wrong opinion that you go to university and suddenly you are free to be whoever you want to be and that it's really welcoming and accepting. But it's just not true,\" Finn explains.</p><p>\"Institutions are still struggling to tackle the experience of all oppressed groups such as black students or women. But at least they attempt to have the statistics on these groups. With LGBT students, they only see it as a social issue.\"</p><p>Finn complains LGBT students are not treated as a group which needs special measures while at university. But she insists bullying and hate crime are a huge problem.</p><p>LGBT NUS has heard horror stories about trans students not being given the support they need while transitioning, of being intimidated by flatmates in university accommodation and of being denied the right to change their old name on their degree certificate.</p><p>One measure the NUS will be working with student unions to introduce is setting up a site where hate crimes can be reported remotely instead of in person. As well encouraging victims to come forward, it's also hoped this will help the NUS gather more accurate data.</p><p>Following the conference, the organisation will launch a research project collecting information on LGBT experiences at university.</p><p>Wes Streeting, head of education at Stonewall agrees that more needs to be done and that without any meaningful data or research on the numbers and experiences of gay students in higher education, it is hard to see how universities are able to reassure themselves and potential applicants that they are providing a genuinely inclusive learning environment.</p><p>\"It's something that the sector needs to address, from the point of application through to their prospect after graduation,\" he says. \"People are paying more for their higher education than ever before and universities need to provide a high quality experience for all students, whatever their background.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 19 April.

Employee turnover is a sad theme, and the Sonic Reaper (as we call him) strikes all too frequently. As such, the past gets forgotten quickly -- treasures from the previous generation are quickly cast aside, as a new regime tries to make a name for themselves (or justify their existence). As such, some of said treasures get left on laid-off-peoples' desks. And in a beautiful twist of fate, this beauty ended up finding its way to my desk, and then in a box with the rest of my stuff when I left Sega.</p><p>I was told that only two of these prototypes were made -- and this is #2.</p><p>This thing is a beast, and definitely the heaviest console I've ever held in my hands. The front features two controller ports, and on top you have a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a Power button, and the venerable Reset button. Note that the logo still says Saturn, so I'm guessing the Pluto codename was simply that, and they were thinking of branding it with the Saturn name. (The logo is printed on production-style though, so I'm guessing they were fairly serious about this one.) The left and right sides feature beautiful-and-exotic vents, while the back is standard Saturn, save for the Netlink ports. The bottom has nothing of note except for the \"PLUTO-02\" sticker (which is, of course, of note).</p></blockquote><p>Wow, Sega really did get through almost all the solar system between Mega Drive and Dreamcast!</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/17/undercurrent-aims-to-bring-deep-sea-exploration-to-oculus-rift/\">UnderCurrent aims to bring deep sea exploration to Oculus Rift | Joystiq</a></h2><blockquote><p>UnderCurrent is an Unreal-powered deep sea exploration game designed for Oculus Rift from a group of university students over in the UK.

You may pass up covering games that don't have a large following. You may break one long story into two chunks to stretch it out.

These claims for infrastructure projects are a lot like alchemy and divert attention away from other, more sustainable, options for job creation.</p><p></p><p>An excellent example is the Heysham M6 link road (the Lancaster northern bypass), a four-mile stretch that was approved for construction in March this year at a cost of £123m.</p><p></p><p>Over a three-year period, Lancashire county council reduced its estimate of the number of jobs that the project would create by a factor of 10, down from 6,000 to 600. It is, of course, not possible with any meaningful precision to say how many jobs are created or, indeed, lost when a new road is inserted into a local economy.</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion reached by a government inquiry in 1999 (the <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20050301192906/http:/ dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_econappr/documents/pdf/ dft_econappr_pdf_022512.pdf\" title=\"\">standing advisory committee</a> on trunk road assessment). Instead, it found that road building \"may sometimes benefit [one city or region] to the disbenefit of the other\". This is a strong warning against exaggerated claims. Unfortunately, it is routinely ignored.</p><p>The committee also concluded that there was no \"convincing general evidence of the size, nature or direction of local economic impacts\" from completed transport projects. A year later it said: \"Better communications will enlarge markets for goods, services and workers: the area as a whole may gain or lose from this depending on the structure and competitiveness of the local economy. It follows that there is no simple, unambiguous link between transport provision and local regeneration.\"</p><p></p><p>The list of exaggerated and scientifically unproven job creation claims goes back a long way. In 1998, supporters of the High-Low Newton bypass on the A590 on the edge of the Lake District said that the bypass would be \"a stimulus to over 2,000 new jobs, a more diverse economy, enhanced competitiveness of existing manufacturing firms [and] more investment\".</p><p></p><p>The 6-mile A30 Bodmin-Indian Queens upgrade in south-west England was supported by claims that it would bring 1,400 jobs to West Cornwall. But in both cases there has been no verification of the job creation claims and no attempt to provide audited case study material to improve decision making on other UK road construction projects.</p><p>The Thames Gateway Bridge proposals in East London were cross-examined in a public inquiry in 2005-06. Claims that 25,000 jobs would be created were <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/media_briefing/ thames_gateway_bridge0.pdf\" title=\"\">found to be flawed</a> and the planning inspector at that inquiry recommended refusal of the proposal to build.</p><p></p><p>The lack of auditing information or National Audit Office publications on the degree to which job creation claims for road building are delivered sits alongside research showing that such claims cannot be verified by empirical evidence. An <a href=\"http://www.eco-logica.co.uk/pdf/GPRoadsJobsEconomy.pdf\" title=\"\">Eco-Logica report</a> in 1994 concluded: \"Road construction is bad value for money as a way of creating jobs. Its rationale is seriously flawed, its performance rarely audited and such benefits as do materialise are rarely maintained into the future as congestion builds up and eliminates the time savings at the centre of the flawed model of economic development.\"</p><p></p><p>The report, which excluded jobs created in the construction phase of a transport project, said that as the UK was a mature economy with high levels of good accessibility in all core regions, transport costs were rarely more than 5% of total operating costs and labour availability and access to pools of highly skilled labour was a key determining factor in decisions around inward investment.</p><p></p><p>Yet claims continue: Cardiff airport (£52m), the M4 in South Wales (£1bn) and high-speed rail (£32bn), all contain promises about jobs and regeneration benefits with no scientific evaluation of the claims or reference to previous studies. And the consequences will be shared unevenly. One study of high-speed rail in Japan showed that Nagoya lost 20% of its employment after the opening of a high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka. This had an important bearing on a calculation by Derby city council <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/68952/economic-impact-of-hs2-to-derby-summary-report.pdf\" title=\"\">that Derby will gain 12,300 jobs as a result of a high-speed rail connection</a> to the city centre.</p><p></p><p><strong>There are three reasons why this all matters a great deal:</strong></p><p>• Decisions should be taken on the basis of high-quality evidence, audit and evaluation. This guarantees best value and prudent use of scarce resources at a time of deep cuts and austerity.</p><p>• Transport spending usually contributes to higher demand for travel and transport. This means more car journeys, more road freight, more air travel and more high-speed rail travel and these are very significant components of growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that challenge all our climate change policies.</p><p>• Transport spending justified wholly or in part by exaggerated claims around job creation represents a wasted opportunity. Creating jobs in local economies and supporting sustainability objectives (eg <a href=\"https://home.ph-freiburg.de/geo/igu/venue.html\" title=\"\">Freiburg, in Germany</a>, has created 10,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector) can be achieved in many different ways and at lower cost per job than a motorway, airport or high-speed rail link. Importantly, these jobs can be created in every local economy, for example by implementing an integrated public transport system in every city in the UK with more than 100,000 people (as in Freiburg or Zurich).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><em>John Whitelegg is a professor of sustainable transport at </em><a href=\"http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Liverpool John Moores University</em></a><em> and an associate of the </em><a href=\"http://www.sei-international.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Stockholm Environment Institute</em></a><em> in York</em></p><p></p><p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular briefings and the latest job opportunities</strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/efficiency-and-risk\">Efficiency and risk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/local-government-network-blog\">Local government network blog</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment\">Local government</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/local-economies\">Local economies</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/policy\">Policy</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Could we repeat the experience today?</p><p>In the early 1930s Britain recovered impressively from a double-dip recession which ended in 1932. In every year from 1933 to 1936, before rearmament could have made any difference, growth exceeded 4% per year. Growth was not driven by fiscal stimulus; indeed it blossomed at a time of fiscal consolidation. So what was the magic formula?</p><p>The main ingredient was the \"<a href=\"http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cheap+Money\" title=\"\">cheap-money policy</a>\". From the middle of 1932, short-term interest rates were reduced close to zero and monetary policy was expansionary enough to stop prices falling and sustain mild inflation in pursuit of a target, set by the chancellor, Neville Chamberlain, to return prices to the 1929 level. The approach was similar in many respects to \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics\" title=\"\">Abenomics</a>\" in today's Japan.</p><p>How did the cheap-money policy stimulate the real economy? A very important channel was through development of new housing. The number of houses built by the private sector rose from 133,000 in 1931-32 to 293,000 in 1934-35 and 279,000 in 1935-36. Many of these dwellings are the famous 1930s semi-detacheds which proliferated around London and more generally across southern England.</p><p>These figures are way ahead of any other year since the second world war. The building of these houses directly contributed an additional £55m to economic activity by 1934, and multiplier effects from increased employment probably raised the total impact to £80m – or a third of the increase in GDP between 1932 and 1934.</p><p>House building reacted to the reduction in interest rates and also to the recognition by developers that construction costs had bottomed out; both of these stimuli resulted from the cheap money policy.</p><p>House building was responsive in the 1930s for two reasons. First, the supply of mortgage finance grew rapidly and became more affordable in an economy in which there had been no financial crisis that curtailed lending. Building society mortgage debt rose from £316m with 720,000 borrowers in 1930 to £636m with 1,392,000 borrowers in 1937 when about 18% of non-agricultural working-class households were buying or owned their own homes.</p><p>In these years, deposits fell in some cases to 5% and repayment terms were extended from around 20 to 25 or even 30 years, reducing weekly outgoings by 15%.</p><p>Second, houses were affordable to an increasing number of potential buyers: 85% of new houses sold for less than £750 (£45,000 in today's money). Terraced houses in the London area could be bought for £395 in the mid-1930s when average earnings were about £165 per year. Houses were cheap because the supply of land for housing was very elastic, which in turn meant that there was no incentive for developers to sit on large land banks. Underpinning the availability of land for house-building was an almost complete absence of land-use planning restrictions which applied to only about 75,000 acres in 1932; the draconian provisions of the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act were still to come.</p><p>Could we repeat the 1930s experience today? It would be very difficult since both mortgage availability and planning rules are very different. Nevertheless, given that we build far fewer houses than are needed to cope with the number of extra households each year, it is desirable to increase the supply of new houses.</p><p>A 1930s-style house building boom would not only be a great boost to economic recovery but would also address real social need. The directions for reforms which could re-create 1930s conditions are clear enough but, sadly, politically too difficult.</p><p></p><p><em>Nicholas Crafts is professor of economics at the </em><a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Warwick</em></a><em> </em></p><p></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for analysis, best practice and the latest job vacancies</strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/future-of-housing\">Future of housing hub</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/housing-network-blog\">Housing network blog</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/finance\">Finance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/development\">Development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing\">Housing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth\">Economic growth (GDP)</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Breakfast is a bowl of muesli or porridge to give me energy for the day.</p><p>I drive to work in a van with a lift to transfer myself and my wheelchair in and out. When I was younger I used to lift the chair and myself, but now I'm older I'm not so strong.</p><p>I'll be in our Milton Keynes office by 9am, and the first thing I'll do is make another cup of tea, then go through emails.</p><p>My key responsibility is to co-ordinate our 20 peer support officers who are either based in specialist spinal cord injury centres or who visit patients in district general hospitals where they are often taken after their spinal cord injury.</p><p>During any day I'll spend time speaking with my team – all of whom have a spinal cord injury – to help in their liaisons with hospital staff and their one-to-one support of patients.</p><p>Sadly, too many spinal cord injured patients wrongly end up in orthopaedic, or even elderly, wards, and they can be the only spinal cord injured patient in the hospital. So they can be deprived of the specialist care that can be vital in the first six months after injury.</p><p>Recent days have largely been spent organising study days around the UK, starting next month, for 600 frontline healthcare professionals, such as nurses and therapists, in general hospitals. These staff can have a lack of understanding of how best to treat and care people with a spinal cord injury. For example, staff can be reticent to move newly-injured people. But, even after just eight hours of lying in one position, pressure ulcers can set in, causing permanent scarring and skin vulnerability. Plus, good bowel and bladder management is vital during a patient's stay in hospital. It is important that healthcare professionals understand how the psychological strength of a paralysed person dealing with a catastrophic event can be damaged if s/he is left lying in their own faeces, rather than introducing a programme to manage the regular removal of it.</p><p>Sometimes consultants faced with their first patient with a spinal cord injury seek our advice. But it's frustrating when we come across a consultant reluctant to ask for guidance.</p><p>I've spent time recently including my and my team's experiences in a care pathways document for <a href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">NHS England</a>.

As a charity, we have to be on top of when our funding begins and ends. My role, for example, is largely funded by The Freemasons' Grand Charity. We constantly review how we can better reach healthcare professionals, and use social media such as Linkedin and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spinalinjuries\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> alongside our <a href=\"http://www.spinal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">website's</a> healthcare portal.</p><p>My day finishes between 5.30-6pm; at home I'll cook dinner for my two sons, and be in bed by 11.30pm.</p><p>When I had my injury, I was dreaming of being a police officer, helping people.

My wife has one in chemistry. We have an 11-year-old son, who should have got his MMR jab in 2003</p><p>A lot has been written about the MMR scare of just over a decade ago. More is being written now because children who were not immunised back then are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/18/swansea-measles-cases-exceed-800\">getting measles</a>. The scare has been thoroughly debunked by people who took risks and did a lot of work. I'm not going to add anything to that.</p><p>But I do want to add a personal story. It's no big deal, but it might be helpful to some people. So here we go. </p><p>I have a doctorate in physics. My wife has one in chemistry. We have an 11-year-old son, who should have got his MMR jab in 2003. We're probably better informed scientifically than most. (You would hope so, anyway, if Oxford and Durham take care when awarding doctorates.) We're generally sceptical, with no particular trust in governments (especially when the prime minister at the time wouldn't say whether his own son had had the treatment he was recommending for everyone else). We read Private Eye, which was back then still saying the now-struck-off and discredited Andrew Wakefield was a victim of a conspiracy. Private Eye is often correct, so who was to know that this time it had its head up its arse?</p><p>Back in 2003, we were in an agony of indecision. In the end it took several days' research to decide what to do. This involved downloading academic papers from outside my own field and desperately trying to understand them. It meant doing it at work, because anyone without academic library access would have had to pay huge amounts for the privilege of reading that publicly funded research. It meant forming a judgement, and there was no escape, no easy way out, because there were risks in all decisions.</p><p>This was very frightening. </p><p>In the end, even to a physicist and a chemist, the medical evidence was overwhelming. He got his MMR. But it was hard.</p><p>The terrible media reporting, and the terrible way the scare was dealt with politically, put parents in a horrible situation. Private Eye has since <a href=\"http://drphilhammond.com/blog/2010/02/18/private-eye/dr-phil%E2%80%99s-private-eye-column-issue-1256-february-17-2010/\">retracted</a>, as have others. I hope everyone does better next time, though the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2013/04/giving-space-andrew-wakefield-mmr-isnt-balance-its-lunacy\">Independent doesn't seem to have learned much</a>.</p><p>I even remember back then, just after the jab, a Marcus Brigstocke routine on BBC Radio 4's Now Show. He made fun of the whole dilemma, but from exactly the point of view of a parent making the decision – as indeed he was at the time. It was great. For the only time ever, I wrote to the BBC Feedback programme, to defend it against some complaints they got. They read my letter out, which was also excellent, except that now I can never write to them again. Who wants to risk a 100% record? (For the same reason I never play fruit machines, as I won £2 first time. Quit while you're ahead.)</p><p>I think in the end, the reason I'm writing this is for anyone out there like me who went through similar agonies of indecision, but maybe couldn't access the papers or didn't have the arrogance with which a particle physicist approaches academic papers (\"It can't be that tricky, it's only biology … \").

It's like a magician's trick. The raw numbers for Windows revenue in Microsoft's Windows division were very substantially up – from $4.633bn (£3bn) in the first three months of 2012, to $5.7bn in the same period this year.</p><p>That's a 24% increase, at a time when we've been hearing that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/11/pc-business-slumps-windows-8\">PC sales have slumped</a>. How has Microsoft done this? Has Steve Ballmer invented antigravity? </p><p>Sadly, no (though it would make a great new business line). </p><p>Make no mistake: Windows is still incredibly important to Microsoft. In this quarter it generated 27% of revenues, and 45% of profits. But how is it doing so well when the PC business is so dismal? </p><p>Here's the first part of what happened. In June, Microsoft offered a scheme where people who bought a Windows 7 PC could update it to Windows 8 for just $15. The scheme ran through to December, and only after that could all the money received in it be cashed in. That gave a $1.1bn boost in \"deferred\" revenue which was really earned in the preceding six months, but couldn't be recognised then.</p><p>Take that away from the latest total, and you're left with $4.60bn in this latest quarter, compared to $4.63bn a year ago.</p><p>However, that still doesn't make sense in the context of a fall in PC shipments. And Peter Klein, Microsoft's outgoing chief financial officer, doesn't disagree that traditional PC sales are plunging: when asked what sort of decline, if any, Microsoft was seeing in shipments, he said: \"On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and Gartner. They're sort of in the 12-13-14 [per cent] down range this quarter.\"</p><p>And Chris Suh, Microsoft's general manager for investor relations, didn't disagree with the IDC./Gartner figures either. Asked for Microsoft's perspective, Suh <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1353291-microsoft-s-management-discusses-f3q-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\">said:</a></p><blockquote><p>\"In the Windows division, revenue was flat this quarter. Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to touch and mobile devices.\"</p></blockquote><p>\"OEM revenue\" is money paid by companies putting Windows onto PCs before they ship them. If that was in line with the underlying market, then it must have fallen, because that's what happened to PC shipments.</p><p>So how do we get to flat revenue for the division? Because of the other element – \"non-OEM\" revenue, such as people buying upgrade licences, or companies buying volume licences. </p><p>And here's what Suh had to say about that: \"Non-OEM revenue grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing. Businesses continue to value the Windows platform, and volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4bn in revenue this year, and nearly three-quarters of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows.\" </p><p>Note that point about Surface. Although Surface has only sold an estimated 1m-1.5m devices (Microsoft didn't give numbers), its revenues (and profits, if any) are allocated to the Windows division. Depending what price you put on it, you get different numbers; given that the Surface RT sold for around $900, principally through Microsoft's stores, the margins might have been thin but the revenue boost would be solid – perhaps as much as $1bn, perhaps only $500m.</p><p>Even so, those are the sorts of numbers that can make a significant difference. If Surface goosed Windows figures even by just $500m, then that boosted them from $4.10bn. And compared with the year before, that would have been 12% down. </p><p>Which, as it happens, is about the amount that PC shipments have gone down. Note that neither Klein nor Suh said that revenues from <em>Windows OEMs</em> were flat – they said \"Windows revenues\".</p><p>But even though it might seem like we've triangulated on how much Surface has contributed to Microsoft – perhaps $500m – that's almost certainly an overestimate. (Independently, <a href=\"http://www.citeworld.com/business/21749/microsofts-surface-strategy-doing-exactly-what-it-was-supposed-do\">Matt Rosoff at CITEWorld puts the figure at $420m.</a>)</p><p>Why? Suh also said: \"Additionally, this quarter we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now two-thirds of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7.\"</p><p>With only a year's support left for Windows XP, businesses are being encouraged to upgrade as fast as they can – so that also boosted non-OEM revenue, as Suh noted above.</p><p>The conclusion? Despite the brave top-line numbers, Microsoft's Windows business is actually hurting. Surface isn't contributing much yet, traditional PC sales are sliding, it doesn't have a tablet competitor yet (though Klein said clearly that it will have a \"smaller\" competitor – aka a rival to the iPad mini – soon enough), and the only thing really keeping everyone smiling is upgrades from businesses facing the wall of XP's end of life.</p><p>Hence the faintly worrying question from Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, who asked Klein: \"This time next year, do we risk a real fall-off again in the PC business, because the upgrade cycle has aided what's been a difficult PC market the last couple of quarters?\"</p><p>Klein's response: \"The upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year. I think over the longer term, what's more interesting is the long-term evolution we're seeing in the device market, which I think is actually going to be more of a driver than any temporal upgrade cycle …\"</p><p>(By this he means the shift towards tablets, and – Microsoft definitely hopes – \"ultramobiles\" such as the Surface Pro running Windows.)</p><p>\"I think that's what Windows 8 was designed to take advantage of, and so I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new services, and the experience that people can get on their devices and different kinds of devices, than it is about an upgrade cycle that's driven by something else.\"</p><p>We'll have to come back in a year's time to see how that looks.</p><p>Oh, and one other point: there wasn't a single mention in the earnings call or the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY13/Q3/default.aspx\">earnings press release</a> of Windows Phone.

But he forgot someone else was writing the script</p><p>You can usually tell when a drama involving a military dictator reaches its final act. Allies desert him, paranoia subsumes all common sense, he lashes out causing not inconsiderable damage. In the end, the fall from power is inevitable. He's booted off stage so that the life of the nation may continue without him.</p><p>So it seemed with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\" title=\"\">President Musharraf</a> when he fled Pakistan for Britain in 2008. But social media have rewritten the old template: people may still argue over precisely what role Twitter played in the Arab spring, but there is no doubt <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/pervez-musharraf-house-arrest-pakistan\" title=\"\">Facebook played a key role</a> in The Dictator's Extra Act. It was only after Pervez Musharraf received hundreds of thousands of \"likes\" on his Facebook page that he decided to cast himself in the role of civilian saviour and ride back into town just in time to contest the upcoming May elections.</p><p>But he overlooked the fact that, while he was the main actor in this drama, someone else was writing the script. First, the masses who had pressed the \"like\" button on their computers didn't actually turn up to greet him at the airport when he returned. Then the courts disqualified him from standing for elections in all four constituencies in which he'd planned to run. Finally, on Thursday, when he appeared at court for a bail hearing on charges related to his 2007 clash with the judiciary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/pervez-musharraf-flees-court-avoids-arrest\" title=\"\">the judge ordered his arrest</a> – whereupon the former commando swiftly departed the premises with his security detail and holed up in his luxury farmhouse on the outskirts of Islamabad, while his Facebook page was updated to include <a href=\"http://www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/apmlpetition\" title=\"\">a petition protesting</a> \"the ill-conceived decision of Islamabad high court\". At the time of writing the petition has 12,894 signatures – the general is no doubt awaiting responses from the rest of the 877,397 people who \"like\" his page. So far, so farcical.</p><p>But although The General's Return has, as yet, been little more than a sideshow in the runup to elections, the fact that riot police were quickly deployed to Musharraf's farmhouse to protect rather than arrest him raises a far more serious question: one that has to do with impunity and the power of the military.</p><p>There's no doubt the chief justice whom Musharraf tried to dismiss in 2007 would like nothing better than to watch due process of law send the general to prison on charges related to the wrongful confinement of judges. But will the military allow its former chief of army staff to be imprisoned for acts carried out while he was in uniform? It is impossible to overstate the significance such an outcome would have in a nation of which it is said, \"other countries have an army; in Pakistan, the army has a country\". And does the military have the power to stop such a thing from happening?</p><p>Certainly, early signs suggested that Musharraf would be treated in a manner quite different to civilian politicians, for whom imprisonment following their fall from power has almost been a rite of passage: just hours after he sped away from the high court Musharraf's farmhouse was declared a \"sub jail\" and his presence there termed \"house arrest\". Threats to his life from the Taliban were given as the reason he couldn't be shifted to a regular jail.</p><p>On Friday morning<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/pervez-musharraf-back-court-arrest\" title=\"\"> he appeared in court again</a> – the police claim to have arrested him overnight, while his threadbare political party insists he gave himself up. He wasn't in handcuffs but even so, the sight of the former head of the army surrounded by the police who had him under arrest was shocking. The judge placed him under judicial remand pending trial for two days, and added <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2013/04/19/musharraf-surrenders-to-authorities-appears-in-court/\" title=\"\">clause 780-A, pertaining to terrorism</a>, to the list of charges against him. He's now back under house arrest for the period of judicial remand, and on Sunday he must face charges in the anti-terror court. If this wasn't enough, the senate, on Friday, <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2013/04/19/senate-passes-resolution-to-try-musharraf-under-article-6/\" title=\"\">unanimously passed a resolution</a> calling for his trial under article 6 of the constitution for derailing democracy and abrogating the constitution.</p><p>Where will this unexpected act end? Anyone who wishes to see democracy strengthened can only wish for Musharraf to be prosecuted – fairly. But, of course, a dramatist's (or indeed novelist's) dreams might wander in different directions: picture the one-time president general standing for elections and all the political parties withdrawing their candidates so that he's handed a victory by default. Could there be any sweeter revenge against autocracy than to watch a former dictator lumbering around parliament, shunned even by those who must sit with him on the opposition benches, watching as other people make history?</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf\">Pervez Musharraf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/socialnetworking\">Social networking</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kamilashamsie\">Kamila Shamsie</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But he forgot someone else was writing the script</p><p>You can usually tell when a drama involving a military dictator reaches its final act. Allies desert him, paranoia subsumes all common sense, he lashes out causing not inconsiderable damage. In the end, the fall from power is inevitable. He's booted off stage so that the life of the nation may continue without him.</p><p>So it seemed with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\" title=\"\">President Musharraf</a> when he fled Pakistan for Britain in 2008. But social media have rewritten the old template: people may still argue over precisely what role Twitter played in the Arab spring, but there is no doubt <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/pervez-musharraf-house-arrest-pakistan\" title=\"\">Facebook played a key role</a> in The Dictator's Extra Act. It was only after Pervez Musharraf received hundreds of thousands of \"likes\" on his Facebook page that he decided to cast himself in the role of civilian saviour and ride back into town just in time to contest the upcoming May elections.</p><p>But he overlooked the fact that, while he was the main actor in this drama, someone else was writing the script. First, the masses who had pressed the \"like\" button on their computers didn't actually turn up to greet him at the airport when he returned. Then the courts disqualified him from standing for elections in all four constituencies in which he'd planned to run. Finally, on Thursday, when he appeared at court for a bail hearing on charges related to his 2007 clash with the judiciary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/pervez-musharraf-flees-court-avoids-arrest\" title=\"\">the judge ordered his arrest</a> – whereupon the former commando swiftly departed the premises with his security detail and holed up in his luxury farmhouse on the outskirts of Islamabad, while his Facebook page was updated to include <a href=\"http://www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/apmlpetition\" title=\"\">a petition protesting</a> \"the ill-conceived decision of Islamabad high court\". At the time of writing the petition has 12,894 signatures – the general is no doubt awaiting responses from the rest of the 877,397 people who \"like\" his page. So far, so farcical.</p><p>But although The General's Return has, as yet, been little more than a sideshow in the runup to elections, the fact that riot police were quickly deployed to Musharraf's farmhouse to protect rather than arrest him raises a far more serious question: one that has to do with impunity and the power of the military.</p><p>There's no doubt the chief justice whom Musharraf tried to dismiss in 2007 would like nothing better than to watch due process of law send the general to prison on charges related to the wrongful confinement of judges. But will the military allow its former chief of army staff to be imprisoned for acts carried out while he was in uniform? It is impossible to overstate the significance such an outcome would have in a nation of which it is said, \"other countries have an army; in Pakistan, the army has a country\". And does the military have the power to stop such a thing from happening?</p><p>Certainly, early signs suggested that Musharraf would be treated in a manner quite different to civilian politicians, for whom imprisonment following their fall from power has almost been a rite of passage: just hours after he sped away from the high court Musharraf's farmhouse was declared a \"sub jail\" and his presence there termed \"house arrest\". Threats to his life from the Taliban were given as the reason he couldn't be shifted to a regular jail.</p><p>On Friday morning<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/pervez-musharraf-back-court-arrest\" title=\"\"> he appeared in court again</a> – the police claim to have arrested him overnight, while his threadbare political party insists he gave himself up. He wasn't in handcuffs but even so, the sight of the former head of the army surrounded by the police who had him under arrest was shocking. The judge placed him under judicial remand pending trial for two days, and added <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2013/04/19/musharraf-surrenders-to-authorities-appears-in-court/\" title=\"\">clause 780-A, pertaining to terrorism</a>, to the list of charges against him. He's now back under house arrest for the period of judicial remand, and on Sunday he must face charges in the anti-terror court. If this wasn't enough, the senate, on Friday, <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2013/04/19/senate-passes-resolution-to-try-musharraf-under-article-6/\" title=\"\">unanimously passed a resolution</a> calling for his trial under article 6 of the constitution for derailing democracy and abrogating the constitution.</p><p>Where will this unexpected act end? Anyone who wishes to see democracy strengthened can only wish for Musharraf to be prosecuted – fairly. But, of course, a dramatist's (or indeed novelist's) dreams might wander in different directions: picture the one-time president general standing for elections and all the political parties withdrawing their candidates so that he's handed a victory by default. Could there be any sweeter revenge against autocracy than to watch a former dictator lumbering around parliament, shunned even by those who must sit with him on the opposition benches, watching as other people make history?</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf\">Pervez Musharraf</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/socialnetworking\">Social networking</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kamilashamsie\">Kamila Shamsie</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were identified, users of both pored endlessly and publicly over photographs and videos of the packed crowd at the marathon finish, hunting for clues.</p><p>There was a particular <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1cipl7/photo_dump_compilation_megathread/\" title=\"\">mass of this on Reddit</a>, which operates a system in which readers' votes push items up a ranking list. Much of this involved crudely computer-drawn circles highlighting people in the marathon crowd who happened to be carrying a rucksack or, to a Reddit user's eye, looked suspicious in some other way. It seemed that being non-white was often a cause for suspicion.</p><p>The efforts of these \"self-deputised internet detectives\", as <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/4chan-reddit-users-claim-identify-potential-suspects-boston-195842168.html\" title=\"\">one journalist called them</a>, saw unwelcome attention focus on several people who, it soon emerged, had nothing to do with the bombings. Some of the speculation bordered on the farcical. One bag-toting presumed suspect, named \"Blue Robe Guy\" by users, was accused of such actions as \"trying to look nonchalant\".</p><p>But there were serious repercussions. A Moroccan-born 17-year-old, Salah Eddin Barhoum, and his friend, Yassine Zaime, were highlighted incorrectly as potential suspects on Reddit, and later on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMatthewKeys/status/324860840392159232/photo/1\" title=\"\">the front page of the New York Post</a>. Barhoum's father <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57580370/teen-stunned-at-portrayal-as-boston-bombing-suspect/\" title=\"\">said later he was worried for the safety of his son and the rest of his family</a>.</p><p>Even when authorities issued pictures of the Tsarnaevs, without names, the potentially harmful tide of misinformation did not stop. Reddit users <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cn9ga/is_missing_student_sunil_tripathi_marathon_bomber/\" title=\"\">quickly, and wrongly, identified</a> the younger of the pair as Sunil Tripathi, a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/25/sunil-tripathi-missing-brown-university_n_2947997.html\" title=\"\">reportedly depressed</a> Brown University student who disappeared in March.</p><p>There was a similar mass of fevered speculation at 4chan, a pointedly anarchic site which began as a discussion point for Japanese animation. The grandly-styled <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/sUrnA#eePetDU\" title=\"\">\"4chan think tank\"</a>, a mass of photographs and videos of the bomb scene with people highlighted for reasons such as looking in a different direction to everyone else, was so clearly ludicrous it soon <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cLvqvEz.jpg\" title=\"\">spawned a parody on the very same website</a>.</p><p>Amid the chaos, however, there were signs of both self-regulation and also the sheer power of information on such an industrial scale. Reddit users <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1civf6/does_anyone_remember_richard_jewell/\" title=\"\">reminded others about Richard Jewell</a>, the security guard falsely accused of involvement in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing. When the FBI circulated photos of the Tsarnaevs, moderators began deleting images of anyone else. Posters then began tracking the brothers' progress using their own photos, including <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/fEZhX\" title=\"\">a chilling image</a> of the white-hatted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev standing just yards from the youngest victim of the blasts, eight-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-martin-richard-killed\" title=\"\">Martin Richard</a>.</p><p>It is undeniable that, in some instances, crowdsourcing can be hugely powerful. Earlier this year a Reddit user <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/1510ap/car_part_left_at_hit_and_run_scene_any_idea_what\" title=\"\">posted a photo of a car's front headlight</a>, the only clue left at the scene of a hit-and-run. A knowledgeable reader was able to pin down not just the model but the precise year.</p><p>The greatest paradox is that the most significant single clue for police seems to have come from a very old-fashioned piece of detective work: first-hand testimony from a brave eyewitness. One of the iconic images of the bombs' aftermath was Jeff Bauman, 27, being taken away in a wheelchair, the bottom half of his legs shattered. As soon as Bauman awoke from sedation, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/boston-bombing-victim-in-iconic-photo-helped-identify-attackers.html\" title=\"\">his brother has since recounted</a>, he was able to give FBI investigators a vital description of a man who dropped a bag at his feet shortly before the explosion.</p><p>Police face \"a double edged sword\" in dealing with the mass of information after such a public crime, said Peter Kirkham, former detective chief inspector with the Metropolitan police.</p><p>The benefits come when police can release images of a particular suspect and use the internet and social media as a gigantic wanted poster. The difficulties arise beforehand, he said: \"Unless you see someone doing something you know is part of the act of the crime, you cannot say, 'That's my suspect.'

Before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were identified, users of both pored endlessly and publicly over photographs and videos of the packed crowd at the marathon finish, hunting for clues.</p><p>There was a particular <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1cipl7/photo_dump_compilation_megathread/\" title=\"\">mass of this on Reddit</a>, which operates a system in which readers' votes push items up a ranking list. Much of this involved crudely computer-drawn circles highlighting people in the marathon crowd who happened to be carrying a rucksack or, to a Reddit user's eye, looked suspicious in some other way. It seemed that being non-white was often a cause for suspicion.</p><p>The efforts of these \"self-deputised internet detectives\", as <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/4chan-reddit-users-claim-identify-potential-suspects-boston-195842168.html\" title=\"\">one journalist called them</a>, saw unwelcome attention focus on several people who, it soon emerged, had nothing to do with the bombings. Some of the speculation bordered on the farcical. One bag-toting presumed suspect, named \"Blue Robe Guy\" by users, was accused of such actions as \"trying to look nonchalant\".</p><p>But there were serious repercussions. A Moroccan-born 17-year-old, Salah Eddin Barhoum, and his friend, Yassine Zaime, were highlighted incorrectly as potential suspects on Reddit, and later on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMatthewKeys/status/324860840392159232/photo/1\" title=\"\">the front page of the New York Post</a>. Barhoum's father <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57580370/teen-stunned-at-portrayal-as-boston-bombing-suspect/\" title=\"\">said later he was worried for the safety of his son and the rest of his family</a>.</p><p>Even when authorities issued pictures of the Tsarnaevs, without names, the potentially harmful tide of misinformation did not stop. Reddit users <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cn9ga/is_missing_student_sunil_tripathi_marathon_bomber/\" title=\"\">quickly, and wrongly, identified</a> the younger of the pair as Sunil Tripathi, a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/25/sunil-tripathi-missing-brown-university_n_2947997.html\" title=\"\">reportedly depressed</a> Brown University student who disappeared in March.</p><p>There was a similar mass of fevered speculation at 4chan, a pointedly anarchic site which began as a discussion point for Japanese animation. The grandly-styled <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/sUrnA#eePetDU\" title=\"\">\"4chan think tank\"</a>, a mass of photographs and videos of the bomb scene with people highlighted for reasons such as looking in a different direction to everyone else, was so clearly ludicrous it soon <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/cLvqvEz.jpg\" title=\"\">spawned a parody on the very same website</a>.</p><p>Amid the chaos, however, there were signs of both self-regulation and also the sheer power of information on such an industrial scale. Reddit users <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1civf6/does_anyone_remember_richard_jewell/\" title=\"\">reminded others about Richard Jewell</a>, the security guard falsely accused of involvement in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing. When the FBI circulated photos of the Tsarnaevs, moderators began deleting images of anyone else. Posters then began tracking the brothers' progress using their own photos, including <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/fEZhX\" title=\"\">a chilling image</a> of the white-hatted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev standing just yards from the youngest victim of the blasts, eight-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-martin-richard-killed\" title=\"\">Martin Richard</a>.</p><p>It is undeniable that, in some instances, crowdsourcing can be hugely powerful. Earlier this year a Reddit user <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/1510ap/car_part_left_at_hit_and_run_scene_any_idea_what\" title=\"\">posted a photo of a car's front headlight</a>, the only clue left at the scene of a hit-and-run. A knowledgeable reader was able to pin down not just the model but the precise year.</p><p>The greatest paradox is that the most significant single clue for police seems to have come from a very old-fashioned piece of detective work: first-hand testimony from a brave eyewitness. One of the iconic images of the bombs' aftermath was Jeff Bauman, 27, being taken away in a wheelchair, the bottom half of his legs shattered. As soon as Bauman awoke from sedation, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/boston-bombing-victim-in-iconic-photo-helped-identify-attackers.html\" title=\"\">his brother has since recounted</a>, he was able to give FBI investigators a vital description of a man who dropped a bag at his feet shortly before the explosion.</p><p>Police face \"a double edged sword\" in dealing with the mass of information after such a public crime, said Peter Kirkham, former detective chief inspector with the Metropolitan police.</p><p>The benefits come when police can release images of a particular suspect and use the internet and social media as a gigantic wanted poster. The difficulties arise beforehand, he said: \"Unless you see someone doing something you know is part of the act of the crime, you cannot say, 'That's my suspect.' You will not see suspicious behaviour from video footage, let alone still pictures. People have their own pet theories, based on racism or another prejudice, as to why something is suspicious. That's how names get out, which devastates people's lives and distracts law enforcement.\"</p><p><strong>Peter Walker</strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/social-media\">Social media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/reddit\">Reddit</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/crowdsourcing\">Crowdsourcing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Pride parades with muscle boys in leather hot pants? Kylie Minogue? Antiquated drag queens miming to Shirley Bassey? \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/13/lip-service-groundbreaking-lesbian-drama\" title=\"\">Lip Service</a>\"?</p><p>A recent piece in The Huffington Post described Grindr as an example of \"gay culture\". For those unfamiliar with modern gay dating rituals, Grindr is an app which enables men to track the locations of potential sexual partners. First launched in 2009, it now claims to have four million users worldwide. In fact, so successful has Grindr been that it recently spawned a lesbian version, called FindHrr.</p><p>Is this what passes for gay culture these days? An app which offers the quickest, easiest way to arrange sexual hook-ups? If Grindr really is an example of gay culture then is dogging an example of \"straight culture\"? And if not, why not?</p><p>Britain's lesbian and gay community has made massive strides in recent years. We have an equal age of consent, employment rights and a whole raft of legal protections we didn't have a decade ago. Soon the UK will even follow in the footsteps of countries like Spain and South Africa and grant same sex couples the right to marry.</p><p>So where does that leave gay culture? For many people, gay culture begins and ends with the gay scene. There are gay magazines devoted to it, and gay people who devote their lives to it. And compared to many countries, we have a gay scene we can be proud of. But all is not well in this rosy pink world. The impact of <a href=\"http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/drug-epidemic-hitting-gay-men-hard010412\" title=\"\">drugs like GHB</a> has led to numerous deaths on the London gay scene. Next month, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the capital is hosting a panel discussion to address the problem. The fact that it's presented by someone called Sleazy Michael gives some idea of the target audience.</p><p>Of course, gay culture isn't confined to the scene. There's also the mainstream. Take television. A decade ago, people said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/15/channel4.gayrights\" title=\"\">Queer As Folk </a>had changed everything. But creator Russell T Davies was the first to admit that it hadn't. As wonderful as Queer As Folk was, it didn't change the way gay men are routinely portrayed on TV. We still have the familiar line-up of camp comedians we've had since the 1970s. The names have changed, but the mannerisms haven't. Once, gay men were associated with the wit and wisdom of Oscar Wilde. Now it's the huff and puff of – well, take your pick.</p><p>Coming up soon on ITV we have the much publicised sitcom Vicious, starring gay national treasures <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/05/ian-mckellen-derek-jacobi-vicious\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi</a>. The original title was Vicious Old Queens. Nothing wrong with that, of course. Such people exist. But this story could have been told 40 years ago – and was, with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase_%28film%29\" title=\"\">Richard Burton and Rex Harrison</a> as an older, squabbling gay couple in the film Staircase.</p><p>We've climbed a long way up the social ladder since Staircase was first shown in 1969. From this vantage point, it's easier to see things from a wider perspective. And with greater legislative freedoms, we have an opportunity to take a broader view of gay politics, and redefine what we mean by gay culture.</p><p>It was with this in mind that Guardian writer Julie Bindel and I decided to launch a new online magazine called <a href=\"http://www.gaze-amodernreview.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gaze – A Modern Review</a>. We didn't want to write about gay lifestyle or pander to straight soap hunks who love their gay fans. We wanted to tackle issues one doesn't generally read about in the lesbian and gay press. For too long, gay people were defined by the expectations of heterosexuals – and we ended up in a ghetto, with a narrow view of the world beyond.

Pride parades with muscle boys in leather hot pants? Kylie Minogue? Antiquated drag queens miming to Shirley Bassey? \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/13/lip-service-groundbreaking-lesbian-drama\" title=\"\">Lip Service</a>\"?</p><p>A recent piece in The Huffington Post described Grindr as an example of \"gay culture\". For those unfamiliar with modern gay dating rituals, Grindr is an app which enables men to track the locations of potential sexual partners. First launched in 2009, it now claims to have four million users worldwide. In fact, so successful has Grindr been that it recently spawned a lesbian version, called FindHrr.</p><p>Is this what passes for gay culture these days? An app which offers the quickest, easiest way to arrange sexual hook-ups? If Grindr really is an example of gay culture then is dogging an example of \"straight culture\"? And if not, why not?</p><p>Britain's lesbian and gay community has made massive strides in recent years. We have an equal age of consent, employment rights and a whole raft of legal protections we didn't have a decade ago. Soon the UK will even follow in the footsteps of countries like Spain and South Africa and grant same sex couples the right to marry.</p><p>So where does that leave gay culture? For many people, gay culture begins and ends with the gay scene. There are gay magazines devoted to it, and gay people who devote their lives to it. And compared to many countries, we have a gay scene we can be proud of. But all is not well in this rosy pink world. The impact of <a href=\"http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/drug-epidemic-hitting-gay-men-hard010412\" title=\"\">drugs like GHB</a> has led to numerous deaths on the London gay scene. Next month, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the capital is hosting a panel discussion to address the problem. The fact that it's presented by someone called Sleazy Michael gives some idea of the target audience.</p><p>Of course, gay culture isn't confined to the scene. There's also the mainstream. Take television. A decade ago, people said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/15/channel4.gayrights\" title=\"\">Queer As Folk </a>had changed everything. But creator Russell T Davies was the first to admit that it hadn't. As wonderful as Queer As Folk was, it didn't change the way gay men are routinely portrayed on TV. We still have the familiar line-up of camp comedians we've had since the 1970s. The names have changed, but the mannerisms haven't. Once, gay men were associated with the wit and wisdom of Oscar Wilde. Now it's the huff and puff of – well, take your pick.</p><p>Coming up soon on ITV we have the much publicised sitcom Vicious, starring gay national treasures <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/05/ian-mckellen-derek-jacobi-vicious\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi</a>. The original title was Vicious Old Queens. Nothing wrong with that, of course. Such people exist. But this story could have been told 40 years ago – and was, with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase_%28film%29\" title=\"\">Richard Burton and Rex Harrison</a> as an older, squabbling gay couple in the film Staircase.</p><p>We've climbed a long way up the social ladder since Staircase was first shown in 1969. From this vantage point, it's easier to see things from a wider perspective. And with greater legislative freedoms, we have an opportunity to take a broader view of gay politics, and redefine what we mean by gay culture.</p><p>It was with this in mind that Guardian writer Julie Bindel and I decided to launch a new online magazine called <a href=\"http://www.gaze-amodernreview.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gaze – A Modern Review</a>. We didn't want to write about gay lifestyle or pander to straight soap hunks who love their gay fans. We wanted to tackle issues one doesn't generally read about in the lesbian and gay press. For too long, gay people were defined by the expectations of heterosexuals – and we ended up in a ghetto, with a narrow view of the world beyond. Now the legal battles are mostly won, isn't it time we reclaimed all of culture – not just the \"gay\" bits – for ourselves?</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights\">Gay rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality\">Sexuality</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps\">Apps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paul-burston\">Paul Burston</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Because not only does MPG Man try to use the accelerator as little as possible, but he's reluctant to go anywhere near the brake. Plus he's so obsessed with the display that he's not thinking about anything else.</p><p>I become him in this Auris Hybrid. I'm not slowing down for corners, junctions, anything. Even though the battery charges when I brake, it means I'll only have to accelerate again: better to stick to one speed. So I'm sailing round tight turns in narrow residential streets at 30mph. I'm not indicating: that would use precious battery power, compromise my electricity and mean that the petrol engine will kick in sooner. Why bother with lights at all, in fact, when there are street lights? Was that a school back there? Who knows. Oh, and I'm freezing – numb with cold – but I'm certainly not going to risk the heater. I still never achieved Toyota's claimed 72.4mpg.</p><p>All that aside (actually, I think there might even be the teeniest something in the above), the Auris isn't a bad car. The design has been sharpened up (you don't remember the previous Auris? Exactly), though its ugly rear doesn't look as if it belongs to its more successful front end. Inside, it's blandsville central, though not entirely unpleasant. There's more room in the boot than in the hybrid version of the last model because they've moved the battery under the back seat.</p><p>To drive? Around town it's quiet and easy. It makes a bit of a fuss getting up to speed on the motorway, but once there it's more relaxed about it. The ride is firm, quite harsh on the speed bumps (don't forget we're not slowing down for them), and the steering is surprisingly precise – good for those tight 30mph turns... Oh yes. Once the green mist descends and you're transformed into MPG Man, the Auris Hybrid becomes much more exciting to drive.

I still never achieved Toyota's claimed 72.4mpg.</p><p>All that aside (actually, I think there might even be the teeniest something in the above), the Auris isn't a bad car. The design has been sharpened up (you don't remember the previous Auris? Exactly), though its ugly rear doesn't look as if it belongs to its more successful front end. Inside, it's blandsville central, though not entirely unpleasant. There's more room in the boot than in the hybrid version of the last model because they've moved the battery under the back seat.</p><p>To drive? Around town it's quiet and easy. It makes a bit of a fuss getting up to speed on the motorway, but once there it's more relaxed about it. The ride is firm, quite harsh on the speed bumps (don't forget we're not slowing down for them), and the steering is surprisingly precise – good for those tight 30mph turns... Oh yes. Once the green mist descends and you're transformed into MPG Man, the Auris Hybrid becomes much more exciting to drive. But on the downside, you are now a major threat to road safety.</p><h2>Toyota Auris Hybrid </h2><p><strong>Price</strong> £21,745 <br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 112mph <br /><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62mph in 10.9 seconds<br /><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 72.4mpg (they say)<br /><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong> 91g/km<br /><strong>Green rating</strong> 9/10 <br /><strong>Cool rating</strong> 6/10</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/motoring\">Motoring</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/toyota\">Toyota</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samwollaston\">Sam Wollaston</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's a game that favours plot, so much that there's a feeling of loss when your failures result in the death of a character – the game's default position is that war fatalities are gone forever, adding a knife-edge to decisions. Story exposition is via lengthy text-only scenes that suffer from lacklustre translation, although it's not enough to spoil the unique personality and sense of character development as the story unfolds. Protagonists bring their relationships with them to the battlefield, providing better support to their chums and even getting married if they get really friendly. While beautifully orchestrated, dexterity-free battles are the focus, the RPG-style levelling-up provides its own fascinating risk and reward.<em> </em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/games\">Games</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nintendo\">Nintendo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/3ds\">3DS</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nickgillett\">Nick Gillett</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth. Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example. So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible. </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO. </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\" </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave. </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google. </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet. </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet. North Korea, I now understand, has its own internet. They have people copying the content that the respected leader thinks is OK and they put it on internal servers and they call that the internet. That's the crudest and least effective strategy, in my view.</p><p>Let me give you some examples of what governments could do. There is something called the DNS, which is the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DNS.html\">Domain Name Service</a>, which is how you get to things, so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">guardian.co.uk</a>. If you go in and you programme that in a certain way, you can actually delete things. You can also, at the protocol level, lock ports, so you can block, for example, access to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> in its entirety. So those have the property that it's not a flat open internet but rather it depends on which country you're in. </p><p>There are things called VPNs. The Chinese Government, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/13/china-cracks-down-on-vpn-use\">plays a game we call whack-a-mole</a>, where every time a VPN shows up, they shut it down and people move. Using modern encryption there are ways of getting even more sophisticated versions of this kind of thing working. The problem is that if you put these restrictions in place, the elites will figure out a way to get around it, but the average person won't, because they don't have time, or knowledge, or education, so there's a real loss of information. </p><h2>On education</h2><p>What's the number one education problem in the developing world? Literacy and childhood education. Can we solve that? Absolutely, at a 100% level. We simply preload phones with all that teaching material. You do it in their local language and, because people are going to be using their phones, they might as well use them to learn how to read. That's easy.</p><p>What's the next problem? The developing world don't have textbooks. So what's another solution? Preload their tablets. We have the textbooks for maths and science, in their languages. </p><p>So now let's talk about college. Well in college you've got new online courses, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">they're called MOOCs</a>, and the anecdotal evidence is that 90% of the viewers are not from the US, and the majority are not from the developed world. That tells me that if you go to Rwanda, Kenya, so forth, you've got an incredibly smart person who does not have textbooks and is hungry for the latest college and graduate school level education, they're going to get it online. </p><p>So what do you need for that? You need bandwidth. If you're in a city in those countries you're going to get that education. If you're in a rural area, you may not, unless those governments are smart enough to get the 3G/4G networks out to the rural areas. </p><p>In South Sudan we asked, \"How do you get information to the people who are in north Sudan, or the Sudan people the government is busy hurting?\" The simplest way to get them information is to smuggle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/sep/16/guardian-android-app-faqs\">SD cards</a> in - you know, the tiny little SD cards, because everybody has a phone. </p><p>They turn out to be incredibly cheap, incredibly standardised, and it's a great way to get information about what's really going on in the world to closed societies. Even if you don't have an internet connection, or your internet connection is too expensive, you could have an SD card which would have the information that I'm describing. And these SD cards are getting more and more powerful. </p><p>People in the developing world are much more clever than we think because they have to work with what they're given. So they'll find a way to solve their information problem with the tools at hand, and this SD card is an example.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/privacy\">Privacy & the media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange\">Julian Assange</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones\">Mobile phones</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer\">Tablet computers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

You do it in their local language and, because people are going to be using their phones, they might as well use them to learn how to read. That's easy.</p><p>What's the next problem? The developing world don't have textbooks. So what's another solution? Preload their tablets. We have the textbooks for maths and science, in their languages. </p><p>So now let's talk about college. Well in college you've got new online courses, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">they're called MOOCs</a>, and the anecdotal evidence is that 90% of the viewers are not from the US, and the majority are not from the developed world. That tells me that if you go to Rwanda, Kenya, so forth, you've got an incredibly smart person who does not have textbooks and is hungry for the latest college and graduate school level education, they're going to get it online. </p><p>So what do you need for that? You need bandwidth. If you're in a city in those countries you're going to get that education. If you're in a rural area, you may not, unless those governments are smart enough to get the 3G/4G networks out to the rural areas. </p><p>In South Sudan we asked, \"How do you get information to the people who are in north Sudan, or the Sudan people the government is busy hurting?\" The simplest way to get them information is to smuggle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/sep/16/guardian-android-app-faqs\">SD cards</a> in - you know, the tiny little SD cards, because everybody has a phone. </p><p>They turn out to be incredibly cheap, incredibly standardised, and it's a great way to get information about what's really going on in the world to closed societies. Even if you don't have an internet connection, or your internet connection is too expensive, you could have an SD card which would have the information that I'm describing. And these SD cards are getting more and more powerful. </p><p>People in the developing world are much more clever than we think because they have to work with what they're given. So they'll find a way to solve their information problem with the tools at hand, and this SD card is an example.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/privacy\">Privacy & the media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange\">Julian Assange</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones\">Mobile phones</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer\">Tablet computers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

An average morning might look something like this:</p><p>There will be no alarm clock in your wake-up routine – at least, not in the traditional sense. Instead, you'll be roused by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, by light entering your room as curtains open automatically, and by a gentle back massage administered by your hi-tech bed. You're more likely to awake refreshed, because inside your mattress there's a special sensor that monitors your sleeping rhythms, determining precisely when to wake you so as not to interrupt an REM cycle.</p><p>Your apartment is an electronic orchestra and you are the conductor. With simple flicks of the wrist and spoken instructions, you can control temperature, humidity, ambient music and lighting. You are able to skim through the day's news on translucent screens while a freshly cleaned suit is retrieved from your automated closet. You head to the kitchen for breakfast and the translucent news display follows, as a projected hologram hovering just in front of you. You grab a mug of coffee and a fresh pastry, cooked to perfection in your humidity-controlled oven, and skim new emails on a holographic tablet projected in front of you. Your central computer system suggests a list of chores your housekeeping robots should tackle today, all of&nbsp;which you approve.</p><p>You pull up notes for a presentation you'll give&nbsp;later that day to important new clients abroad. All of your data – from your personal and&nbsp;professional life – is accessible through all&nbsp;of&nbsp;your various devices, as it's stored in the&nbsp;cloud,&nbsp;a remote digital-storage system with&nbsp;near&nbsp;limitless capacity. You own a&nbsp;few&nbsp;different and interchangeable digital&nbsp;devices; one is the size of a&nbsp;tablet, another the size of a&nbsp;pocket watch, while others might&nbsp;be flexible or wearable. All&nbsp;will be lightweight, incredibly fast and will use&nbsp;more&nbsp;powerful processors&nbsp;than&nbsp;anything available today.</p><p>As you move about your kitchen, you stub your&nbsp;toe, hard, on the edge of a cabinet – ouch! You grab your mobile device and open the diagnostics app. Inside your device there is a tiny microchip that uses low-radiation submillimetre waves to scan your body, like an x-ray. A quick scan reveals that your toe is just bruised, not broken. You decline the invitation to get a second opinion at a nearby doctor's office.</p><p>There's a bit of time left before you need to leave for work – which you'll get to by driverless car, of course. Your commute will be as productive or relaxing as you desire.</p><p>Before you head out, your device reminds you&nbsp;to buy a gift for your nephew's upcoming birthday. You scan the system's proposed gift ideas, derived from anonymous, aggregated data on other nine-year-old boys with his profile and interests, but none of the suggestions inspires you. Then you remember a story his parents told you that had everyone 40 and older laughing: your nephew hadn't understood a reference to the old excuse \"a dog ate my homework\"; how could a dog eat his cloud storage drive? You do a&nbsp;quick search for a robotic dog and buy one with a single click. In the card input, you type: \"Just in&nbsp;case.\" It will arrive at his house within a five-minute window of your selected delivery time.</p><p>You think about having another cup of coffee, but then a haptic device (\"haptic\" refers to technology that involves touch and feeling) that is embedded in the heel of your shoe gives you a&nbsp;gentle pinch – a signal that you'll be late for your morning meeting if you linger any longer.</p><p>Being able to do more in the virtual world will make the mechanics of our physical world more efficient. As digital connectivity reaches the far corners of the globe, new users will employ it&nbsp;to improve a wide range of inefficient markets, systems and behaviours, in&nbsp;both the most and least advanced societies. The resulting gains in efficiency and productivity will be&nbsp;profound, particularly in developing countries, where technological isolation and bad policies have stymied growth and progress for years.</p><p>The accessibility of affordable smart devices, including phones and tablets, will be transformative in these countries. Consider the impact of basic mobile phones for a group of Congolese fisherwomen today. Whereas they used to bring their daily catch to the market and watch it slowly spoil as the day progressed, now they keep it on the line, in the river, and wait for calls from customers. Once an order is placed, a fish is brought out of the water and prepared for the buyer. There is no need for an expensive refrigerator, no need for someone to guard it at night, no danger of spoiled fish losing their value (or poisoning customers) and no unnecessary overfishing. The size of these women's market can even expand as other fishermen in surrounding areas coordinate with them over their own phones. As a substitute for a formal market economy (which would take years to develop), that's not a bad work-around for these women or the community at large.</p><p>Mobile phones are transforming how people in the developing world access and use information, and adoption rates are soaring. There are already more than 650m mobile phone users in Africa, and close to 3bn across Asia. The majority of these people are using basic-feature phones – voice calls and text messages only – because the cost of data service in their countries is often prohibitively expensive. This will change and, when it does, the smartphone revolution will profoundly benefit these populations.</p><p>What connectivity also brings, beyond mobile phones, is the ability to collect and use data. Data itself is a tool, and in places where unreliable statistics about health, education, economics and&nbsp;the population's needs have stalled growth and development, the chance to gather data effectively is a game-changer. Everyone in society benefits, as governments can better measure the success of their programmes, and media and other nongovernmental organisations can use data to support their work and check facts.</p><p>And the developing world will not be left out of&nbsp;the advances in gadgetry and other hi-tech machinery. Even if the prices for sophisticated smartphones and robots remain high, illicit markets such as China's expansive shanzhai network for knock-off consumer electronics will produce and distribute imitations that bridge the&nbsp;gap.</p><p>In \"additive manufacturing\", or 3D printing, machines can actually \"print\" physical objects ultra-thin layer by ultra-thin layer. Communal 3D&nbsp;printers in poor countries would allow people to make whatever tool or item they require from open-source templates. In wealthier countries, 3D printing will be the perfect partner for advanced manufacturing. New materials and products will all be built uniquely to a specification from the internet and on demand by a machine run by a&nbsp;sophisticated, trained operator.</p><p>As for life's daily tasks, information systems will&nbsp;free us of many small burdens that today add stress and chip away at our mental focus. Our own neurological limits, which lead us to forgetfulness and oversights, will be supplemented by information systems designed to support our needs. Two such examples are memory prosthetics – calendar reminders and to-do lists – and social prosthetics, which instantly connect you with your friend who has relevant expertise in whatever task you are facing.</p><p>By relying on these integrated systems, we'll be&nbsp;able to use our time more effectively each day – whether that means having a \"deep think\", spending more time preparing for an important presentation or guaranteeing that a parent can attend his or her child's football match without distraction.</p><p>Yet despite these advancements, a&nbsp;central and singular caveat exists: the&nbsp;impact of this data revolution will be to strip citizens of much of their control over their&nbsp;personal information in virtual space, and that will have significant consequences in the physical world.</p><p>In the future, our identities in everyday life will come to be defined more and more by our virtual activities and associations. Our highly documented pasts will have an impact on our prospects, and our ability to influence and control how we are perceived by others will decrease dramatically. The potential for someone else to access, share or manipulate parts of our online identities will increase, particularly due to our reliance on cloud-based data storage.</p><p>The basics of online identity could also change. Some governments will consider it too risky to have thousands of anonymous, untraceable and unverified citizens. Your online identity in the future is unlikely to be a simple Facebook page; instead, it will be a constellation of profiles, from every online activity, that will be verified and perhaps even regulated by the government. Imagine all of your accounts – Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Google+, Netflix, newspaper&nbsp;subscription – linked to&nbsp;an \"official profile\".</p><p>Identity will be the most valuable commodity for citizens in the future, and it will exist primarily online. We will see a&nbsp;proliferation of businesses that cater to privacy and reputation concerns. We will even see the rise of a new black market, where people can buy real or invented identities.</p><p>Without question, the increased access to people's lives that the data revolution brings will give some repressive autocracies a dangerous advantage in targeting their citizens. Yet demand for tools and software to help safeguard citizens living under digital repression will give rise to a growing and aggressive industry. And that is the power of this new information revolution: for every negative, there will be a counter-response that has the potential to be a substantial positive. More people will fight for privacy and security than look to restrict it, even in the most repressive parts of the world.</p><p>• <strong>© Google Inc. and Jared Cohen</strong></p><p>This is an edited extract from The New Digital Age: Reshaping The Future Of People, Nations And Business, by Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen, published on 25 April by John Murray at £25.

The resulting gains in efficiency and productivity will be&nbsp;profound, particularly in developing countries, where technological isolation and bad policies have stymied growth and progress for years.</p><p>The accessibility of affordable smart devices, including phones and tablets, will be transformative in these countries. Consider the impact of basic mobile phones for a group of Congolese fisherwomen today. Whereas they used to bring their daily catch to the market and watch it slowly spoil as the day progressed, now they keep it on the line, in the river, and wait for calls from customers. Once an order is placed, a fish is brought out of the water and prepared for the buyer. There is no need for an expensive refrigerator, no need for someone to guard it at night, no danger of spoiled fish losing their value (or poisoning customers) and no unnecessary overfishing. The size of these women's market can even expand as other fishermen in surrounding areas coordinate with them over their own phones. As a substitute for a formal market economy (which would take years to develop), that's not a bad work-around for these women or the community at large.</p><p>Mobile phones are transforming how people in the developing world access and use information, and adoption rates are soaring. There are already more than 650m mobile phone users in Africa, and close to 3bn across Asia. The majority of these people are using basic-feature phones – voice calls and text messages only – because the cost of data service in their countries is often prohibitively expensive. This will change and, when it does, the smartphone revolution will profoundly benefit these populations.</p><p>What connectivity also brings, beyond mobile phones, is the ability to collect and use data. Data itself is a tool, and in places where unreliable statistics about health, education, economics and&nbsp;the population's needs have stalled growth and development, the chance to gather data effectively is a game-changer. Everyone in society benefits, as governments can better measure the success of their programmes, and media and other nongovernmental organisations can use data to support their work and check facts.</p><p>And the developing world will not be left out of&nbsp;the advances in gadgetry and other hi-tech machinery. Even if the prices for sophisticated smartphones and robots remain high, illicit markets such as China's expansive shanzhai network for knock-off consumer electronics will produce and distribute imitations that bridge the&nbsp;gap.</p><p>In \"additive manufacturing\", or 3D printing, machines can actually \"print\" physical objects ultra-thin layer by ultra-thin layer. Communal 3D&nbsp;printers in poor countries would allow people to make whatever tool or item they require from open-source templates. In wealthier countries, 3D printing will be the perfect partner for advanced manufacturing. New materials and products will all be built uniquely to a specification from the internet and on demand by a machine run by a&nbsp;sophisticated, trained operator.</p><p>As for life's daily tasks, information systems will&nbsp;free us of many small burdens that today add stress and chip away at our mental focus. Our own neurological limits, which lead us to forgetfulness and oversights, will be supplemented by information systems designed to support our needs. Two such examples are memory prosthetics – calendar reminders and to-do lists – and social prosthetics, which instantly connect you with your friend who has relevant expertise in whatever task you are facing.</p><p>By relying on these integrated systems, we'll be&nbsp;able to use our time more effectively each day – whether that means having a \"deep think\", spending more time preparing for an important presentation or guaranteeing that a parent can attend his or her child's football match without distraction.</p><p>Yet despite these advancements, a&nbsp;central and singular caveat exists: the&nbsp;impact of this data revolution will be to strip citizens of much of their control over their&nbsp;personal information in virtual space, and that will have significant consequences in the physical world.</p><p>In the future, our identities in everyday life will come to be defined more and more by our virtual activities and associations. Our highly documented pasts will have an impact on our prospects, and our ability to influence and control how we are perceived by others will decrease dramatically. The potential for someone else to access, share or manipulate parts of our online identities will increase, particularly due to our reliance on cloud-based data storage.</p><p>The basics of online identity could also change. Some governments will consider it too risky to have thousands of anonymous, untraceable and unverified citizens. Your online identity in the future is unlikely to be a simple Facebook page; instead, it will be a constellation of profiles, from every online activity, that will be verified and perhaps even regulated by the government. Imagine all of your accounts – Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Google+, Netflix, newspaper&nbsp;subscription – linked to&nbsp;an \"official profile\".</p><p>Identity will be the most valuable commodity for citizens in the future, and it will exist primarily online. We will see a&nbsp;proliferation of businesses that cater to privacy and reputation concerns. We will even see the rise of a new black market, where people can buy real or invented identities.</p><p>Without question, the increased access to people's lives that the data revolution brings will give some repressive autocracies a dangerous advantage in targeting their citizens. Yet demand for tools and software to help safeguard citizens living under digital repression will give rise to a growing and aggressive industry. And that is the power of this new information revolution: for every negative, there will be a counter-response that has the potential to be a substantial positive. More people will fight for privacy and security than look to restrict it, even in the most repressive parts of the world.</p><p>• <strong>© Google Inc. and Jared Cohen</strong></p><p>This is an edited extract from The New Digital Age: Reshaping The Future Of People, Nations And Business, by Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen, published on 25 April by John Murray at £25.

Google's executive chairman tells all</p><p>I am face to face with the man who knows everything about me. He knows where I've been, who I know and what I think.&nbsp;He knows what I&nbsp;do and when I do it; who I talk to and what I want to do next.&nbsp;He knows about my health, my work, my home, my finances, my dreams.</p><p>His face is a foot away from mine. He is middle aged, with steel-rimmed glasses and a white open-necked shirt. He&nbsp;looks pleasant.</p><p>He is not a government agent or a policeman. My instinct is to trust this man, so mildly spoken and full of precisely articulated reason. He is telling me about my future – for he knows about that, as well. He knows about your future, too – yours and billions like you.</p><p>He begins to explain this future. He knows how human beings will learn, travel, heal themselves, do politics, conduct business and wage war. He sees everything and can rationalise everything. And – I can't quite get this thought out of my head – he knows all about me.</p><p>But I know I'm getting carried away. It's not that Eric Schmidt does actually know all these things about me.&nbsp;Not me by name. But his company collects and stores an extraordinary amount of data about all of us, albeit in an anonymised form. Which is all well and good, until government agencies come knocking on Schmidt's door – as they did <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html\" title=\"\">more than 20,000 times in the second half of last year</a>. The company usually obliges with US officials. (It's more complicated with others.) This will only get worse.</p><p>The balance between the power for good of this infinite ocean of data – benignly represented by the man in front of me – and the awful potential of its misuse clearly troubles Schmidt. So much so that he has written a <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848546202\" title=\"\">book</a> about it.</p><p>This is the second time in a week or so that we have hung out. The first time is in Delhi, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/media-network-blog/video/activate-india-schmidt-rusbridger-video\" title=\"\">when I&nbsp;interview him in front of an audience of Indian media and technology types</a>. On stage he's confident, quick-witted and even a bit puckish.</p><p>We're due to meet again in London but he tells me he's going to cancel as he's damaged his shoulder in a sporting injury. I'm intrigued by his choice of work-out – not your average exercise for a 57-year-old engineer-turned-global-executive chairman. Was it public knowledge that he had this particular (entirely blameless) pastime? \"No,\" he says emphatically, adding without apparent irony, \"You have to fight for your privacy or you lose it.\"</p><p>So the second time we literally hang out, on a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/\" title=\"\">Google Hangout</a> – Skype with bells and whistles – of the sort he built for just this kind of encounter. He's in New York; I'm in London, hoping he won't notice the clutter in my office. Eric Schmidt looks like a clear-desk man.</p><p>His shoulder is better, though he advises me off&nbsp;the meds his doctors had given him in India. \"I&nbsp;was totally out of it for about four days.\"</p><p>I hadn't noticed. He'd seemed the same Schmidt as now – thoughtful, controlled, precise, sharp. It's just over 12 years since the managerial computer scientist joined Google as the \"adult\" to babysit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" title=\"\">Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the kids who'd started it all</a>. He'd begun life writing programmes on old mainframes before discovering he had an entrepreneurial streak – and&nbsp;that he wasn't bad at figures, strategy and running things. He's now executive chairman of one of the most powerful companies in history.</p><p>Blessed are the geeks etc: Schmidt is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/eric-schmidt/\" title=\"\">said to be worth $8.2bn</a> (£5.4bn). But, while he has indeed inherited quite a bit of the Earth, he remains a most unusual chairman. Within the past few weeks he has been hanging out in North Korea. Physically, not just down a computer line. (Asked why, he deadpans: \"Free food, you know, hang out with the basketball players, that kind of thing. Sorry, wrong guy.\")</p><p>What's more, it was in Iraq that he struck on the idea of writing a book – at a chance encounter with his future co-author, the writer and foreign policy adviser <a href=\"http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/jared-cohen\" title=\"\">Jared Cohen</a>. That was in 2009, a time when there wasn't a long queue of Fortune 500 bosses at Baghdad International Airport. \"It&nbsp;was the first of these kinds of trips, of seeing what the world was really like.\"</p><p>Among his main discoveries was that people are the same the world over. \"I've never met a person who does not want a safer world, better medical care and education for their children, and&nbsp;peace with their neighbours.&nbsp;I just don't meet those people.&nbsp;What I meet, over and over again, as I travel around, is that the essential human condition is optimistic – in every one of these places.&nbsp;They may or may not have reasonable governments, but the people are the same as us.\"</p><p>These expeditions – to several parts of Africa, the Middle East, Burma, Malaysia, Iran – developed a triple function. To make money for Google, obviously. To gather material for the book (co-writing it along the way on Google Docs, naturally). And – how to put it? – a kind of global corporate social responsibility for a company that believes in the public realm as well as in keeping its shareholders happy.</p><p>Schmidt re-orders these. \"Google was founded to get information to everybody,\" he says. \"A&nbsp;by-product of that strategy is that we invented an advertising business which has provided great economics that allows us to build the servers, hire&nbsp;the employees, create value. The book was an old-world artefact intended to start a conversation about what's going to happen to the&nbsp;planet when another five billion people become digitally connected. Which, thanks to mobile technologies, is sooner than you think.</p><p>\"There's a lot of discussion in the world about&nbsp;the two billion that are connected,\" he says. \"We spend all day talking about the issues of e-commerce and start-ups and globalisation and so forth, and we forget that the majority of people are not online and that they will come online, the majority of them in the next five years.</p><p>\"It's going to happen very fast. It's going to happen in countries which don't have the same principles that we in America have from the British legal system – around law and privacy and those sorts of things. All sorts of crazy stuff is going to happen. Human societies can't change that fast without both good and negative implications.\"</p><p>Schmidt has generally been thought a technological optimist – and he still overwhelmingly celebrates the way connectivity will rapidly revolutionise medicine, education, agriculture and productivity for the rest of the world. But the book is also very alive to the downsides of what is to come – either through the&nbsp;behaviour of repressive states or the actions of a tiny minority, including terrorists. \"The future for us is great. The quality of life of the first world just gets better and better and better. But for these people, they're going to go through a rough patch where all this information shows up and they can't quite figure out what to&nbsp;do.\"</p><p>It's a mantra in everything he talks about. He doesn't waste much breath on China – Google's very public falling-out is well-documented. He was shocked to find that North Korea had built its own version of the internet – a kind of national intranet. He chides India and Russia for various restrictive bits of legislation around the liability for content. Burma's new press laws \"look like Stalin's Russia\".</p><p>In Mexico, he worries about the government building a dossier on every citizen as part of the narco wars. He ridicules the leaders of Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, past or present, for misunderstanding the open nature of the internet. In South Sudan he becomes excited at the possibilities of how much information can be&nbsp;smuggled via tiny SD micro-cards.</p><p>He is more circumspect about Europe: a hefty chunk of Google's vast legal team has had its work cut out in recent months and years trying to navigate the political and commercial eddies in both Germany and France.</p><p>\"We've been engaged in lengthy conversations, through the [French] president's office, with the chief publishers,\" he says with a barely masked sigh of frustration. \"They have a problem where the digital transition is not happening fast enough from a revenue perspective, something you understand very well in Britain as well. And so what we agreed, after a lot of give and take with the president, was to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/feb/01/google-52m-fund-help-french-publishers\" title=\"\">create a digital transition fund of <em>€</em>50m or <em>€</em>60m</a>, I believe, over a five-year period. And that money will be run by a board [that] will then choose the technologies and new ways of monetising digital content for France. I&nbsp;think this is an excellent outcome for France.\"</p><p>That sounds great, I say. Can we have one, too?</p><p>\"I'm sure we can talk about it.\" Nervous laugh.</p><p>You can just say yes.</p><p>Schmidt sighs again. The prospect of European governments (and media companies) forming an orderly queue behind the French is obviously one that has occurred to him. He prevaricates: \"The reason I like this model is it's… I don't like the idea of randomly writing cheques to publishers in the old model, and I think it's a very good idea for Google to assist in the transformation of their business model from old to new. So it's a very good positioning.\"</p><p>Change of subject. He wants to return to the future. The book has sections on how domestic life will change – how your mobile phone will make you dinner in the evening while your fridge does your son's homework and your smart lawn mower performs a hip-replacement operation on your husband… that sort of thing. All this from the man who is about to bring you glasses you can talk to. (\"You don't say much to it, by the way.\") The future is going to be great for robots, it turns out – but also, he insists, for human beings, so long as they can become more creative. Which they will.</p><p>But the bigger stuff – on the future of nation states, politics and war, the Balkanisation of the internet – is less familiar. He is particularly exercised about the miniaturisation of war – for example, the prospect of privately owned drones, which have the potential to act as a new type of IED, able to be used in the air or on the ground.</p><p>\"Let me do it as a 'How would you feel?',\" he&nbsp;says. \"You're having a dispute with your neighbour. How would you feel if your neighbour went over and bought a commercial observation drone that they can launch from their back yard. It just flies over your house all day. How would you feel about it?</p><p>\"If you look at the miniaturisation of drones, there will be restrictions on them. I can give you worse examples, but you get the idea. So it's probable that robotics becomes a significant component of nation state warfare. I'm not going to pass judgment on whether armies should exist, but I would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to fight war to every single human being.</p><p>\"It's got to be regulated. You just can't imagine that British people would allow this sort of thing, and I can't imagine American people would allow this sort of thing. It's one thing for governments, who have some legitimacy in what they're doing,&nbsp;but have other people doing it… It's not going to happen.\"</p><p>I suggest that the question of what you do about bad things that can't be uninvented applies&nbsp;to Google itself. He bridles at the word \"Frankenstein\".</p><p>\"Google is not a bunch of engineers who throw stuff over the wall,\" he says rather stiffly.</p><p>\"A classic example is that a team built a facial-recognition tool. It was just really good – state of the art at the time. We stopped that product for two reasons. One is that it turned out to be illegal in Europe and the second was that it was not a good product to offer in the US for the same reasons. So we didn't do it.\"</p><p>What stopped it in the US?</p><p>\"Our judgment. I made the decision; I was literally in the room.\"</p><p>\"Facial recognition, completely unmonitored, can&nbsp;be used for very bad things. It can be used for stalking, for example. You know, it's just we don't want to be part of that as a company. There are cases where facial recognition can be used, but they need to be fairly carefully boxed. If you look at Facebook, for example, they have this Facebook tagging thing which is essentially face recognition, and they went through a huge cycle where they made it too aggressive. People got freaked out, and then they had to pull back on it. So we're super-sensitive on any of these privacy issues.</p><p>He warns of the dangers of combining London-style traffic cameras with this technology. \"You could imagine the sort of aggressive, obnoxious autocrats saying, 'Well, we need this to keep our people under control', and once those things are in place, they're very hard to turn off. They really are.\"</p><p>His research led him to a conversation with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. He was struck by one \"important\" argument Assange advanced – that systematic evil has to be written down, and therefore can be subverted by leaking. He ponders how events in Hitler's Germany or Rwanda might have been different with the internet. \"So I had sympathy for the Assange intellectual argument, but not sympathy for the implementation.\"</p><p>Why not the implementation, if whistleblowing is an answer to bad things happening?</p><p>His instincts as a cautious Fortune 500 executive chairman kick in. \"I want to be careful about what I'm saying about leaking. This is a minefield.\"</p><p>Pressed further, he picks his words with care: \"The problem is… who gets to decide who does&nbsp;the leaking? Well, Assange's answer was himself,&nbsp;and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision, because it's a pretty weighty&nbsp;decision. \"</p><p>Finally, some questions about Schmidt himself. The announcement that he's soon <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/09/us-google-schmidt-idUSBRE91712W20130209\" title=\"\">selling off 40% of his Google stock</a> has provoked people to suggest his time with the company is coming to an end. \"Completely false.\" Not thinking about a job in government? \"No, never.\"</p><p>Kindle or BlackBerry?</p><p>\"I'm a BlackBerry user. I like the keyboard, although BlackBerry is certainly in trouble.\"</p><p>Facebook or Twitter?</p><p>\"Twitter has a more distinct model because of the celebrity and publishing model. Facebook is in a transition and I don't know enough about what they're transitioning to.

Google's executive chairman tells all</p><p>I am face to face with the man who knows everything about me. He knows where I've been, who I know and what I think.&nbsp;He knows what I&nbsp;do and when I do it; who I talk to and what I want to do next.&nbsp;He knows about my health, my work, my home, my finances, my dreams.</p><p>His face is a foot away from mine. He is middle aged, with steel-rimmed glasses and a white open-necked shirt. He&nbsp;looks pleasant.</p><p>He is not a government agent or a policeman. My instinct is to trust this man, so mildly spoken and full of precisely articulated reason. He is telling me about my future – for he knows about that, as well. He knows about your future, too – yours and billions like you.</p><p>He begins to explain this future. He knows how human beings will learn, travel, heal themselves, do politics, conduct business and wage war. He sees everything and can rationalise everything. And – I can't quite get this thought out of my head – he knows all about me.</p><p>But I know I'm getting carried away. It's not that Eric Schmidt does actually know all these things about me.&nbsp;Not me by name. But his company collects and stores an extraordinary amount of data about all of us, albeit in an anonymised form. Which is all well and good, until government agencies come knocking on Schmidt's door – as they did <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html\" title=\"\">more than 20,000 times in the second half of last year</a>. The company usually obliges with US officials. (It's more complicated with others.) This will only get worse.</p><p>The balance between the power for good of this infinite ocean of data – benignly represented by the man in front of me – and the awful potential of its misuse clearly troubles Schmidt. So much so that he has written a <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848546202\" title=\"\">book</a> about it.</p><p>This is the second time in a week or so that we have hung out. The first time is in Delhi, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/media-network-blog/video/activate-india-schmidt-rusbridger-video\" title=\"\">when I&nbsp;interview him in front of an audience of Indian media and technology types</a>. On stage he's confident, quick-witted and even a bit puckish.</p><p>We're due to meet again in London but he tells me he's going to cancel as he's damaged his shoulder in a sporting injury. I'm intrigued by his choice of work-out – not your average exercise for a 57-year-old engineer-turned-global-executive chairman. Was it public knowledge that he had this particular (entirely blameless) pastime? \"No,\" he says emphatically, adding without apparent irony, \"You have to fight for your privacy or you lose it.\"</p><p>So the second time we literally hang out, on a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/\" title=\"\">Google Hangout</a> – Skype with bells and whistles – of the sort he built for just this kind of encounter. He's in New York; I'm in London, hoping he won't notice the clutter in my office. Eric Schmidt looks like a clear-desk man.</p><p>His shoulder is better, though he advises me off&nbsp;the meds his doctors had given him in India. \"I&nbsp;was totally out of it for about four days.\"</p><p>I hadn't noticed. He'd seemed the same Schmidt as now – thoughtful, controlled, precise, sharp. It's just over 12 years since the managerial computer scientist joined Google as the \"adult\" to babysit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\" title=\"\">Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the kids who'd started it all</a>. He'd begun life writing programmes on old mainframes before discovering he had an entrepreneurial streak – and&nbsp;that he wasn't bad at figures, strategy and running things. He's now executive chairman of one of the most powerful companies in history.</p><p>Blessed are the geeks etc: Schmidt is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/eric-schmidt/\" title=\"\">said to be worth $8.2bn</a> (£5.4bn). But, while he has indeed inherited quite a bit of the Earth, he remains a most unusual chairman. Within the past few weeks he has been hanging out in North Korea. Physically, not just down a computer line. (Asked why, he deadpans: \"Free food, you know, hang out with the basketball players, that kind of thing. Sorry, wrong guy.\")</p><p>What's more, it was in Iraq that he struck on the idea of writing a book – at a chance encounter with his future co-author, the writer and foreign policy adviser <a href=\"http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/jared-cohen\" title=\"\">Jared Cohen</a>. That was in 2009, a time when there wasn't a long queue of Fortune 500 bosses at Baghdad International Airport. \"It&nbsp;was the first of these kinds of trips, of seeing what the world was really like.\"</p><p>Among his main discoveries was that people are the same the world over. \"I've never met a person who does not want a safer world, better medical care and education for their children, and&nbsp;peace with their neighbours.&nbsp;I just don't meet those people.&nbsp;What I meet, over and over again, as I travel around, is that the essential human condition is optimistic – in every one of these places.&nbsp;They may or may not have reasonable governments, but the people are the same as us.\"</p><p>These expeditions – to several parts of Africa, the Middle East, Burma, Malaysia, Iran – developed a triple function. To make money for Google, obviously. To gather material for the book (co-writing it along the way on Google Docs, naturally). And – how to put it? – a kind of global corporate social responsibility for a company that believes in the public realm as well as in keeping its shareholders happy.</p><p>Schmidt re-orders these. \"Google was founded to get information to everybody,\" he says. \"A&nbsp;by-product of that strategy is that we invented an advertising business which has provided great economics that allows us to build the servers, hire&nbsp;the employees, create value. The book was an old-world artefact intended to start a conversation about what's going to happen to the&nbsp;planet when another five billion people become digitally connected. Which, thanks to mobile technologies, is sooner than you think.</p><p>\"There's a lot of discussion in the world about&nbsp;the two billion that are connected,\" he says. \"We spend all day talking about the issues of e-commerce and start-ups and globalisation and so forth, and we forget that the majority of people are not online and that they will come online, the majority of them in the next five years.</p><p>\"It's going to happen very fast. It's going to happen in countries which don't have the same principles that we in America have from the British legal system – around law and privacy and those sorts of things. All sorts of crazy stuff is going to happen. Human societies can't change that fast without both good and negative implications.\"</p><p>Schmidt has generally been thought a technological optimist – and he still overwhelmingly celebrates the way connectivity will rapidly revolutionise medicine, education, agriculture and productivity for the rest of the world. But the book is also very alive to the downsides of what is to come – either through the&nbsp;behaviour of repressive states or the actions of a tiny minority, including terrorists. \"The future for us is great. The quality of life of the first world just gets better and better and better. But for these people, they're going to go through a rough patch where all this information shows up and they can't quite figure out what to&nbsp;do.\"</p><p>It's a mantra in everything he talks about. He doesn't waste much breath on China – Google's very public falling-out is well-documented. He was shocked to find that North Korea had built its own version of the internet – a kind of national intranet. He chides India and Russia for various restrictive bits of legislation around the liability for content. Burma's new press laws \"look like Stalin's Russia\".</p><p>In Mexico, he worries about the government building a dossier on every citizen as part of the narco wars. He ridicules the leaders of Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, past or present, for misunderstanding the open nature of the internet. In South Sudan he becomes excited at the possibilities of how much information can be&nbsp;smuggled via tiny SD micro-cards.</p><p>He is more circumspect about Europe: a hefty chunk of Google's vast legal team has had its work cut out in recent months and years trying to navigate the political and commercial eddies in both Germany and France.</p><p>\"We've been engaged in lengthy conversations, through the [French] president's office, with the chief publishers,\" he says with a barely masked sigh of frustration. \"They have a problem where the digital transition is not happening fast enough from a revenue perspective, something you understand very well in Britain as well. And so what we agreed, after a lot of give and take with the president, was to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/feb/01/google-52m-fund-help-french-publishers\" title=\"\">create a digital transition fund of <em>€</em>50m or <em>€</em>60m</a>, I believe, over a five-year period. And that money will be run by a board [that] will then choose the technologies and new ways of monetising digital content for France. I&nbsp;think this is an excellent outcome for France.\"</p><p>That sounds great, I say. Can we have one, too?</p><p>\"I'm sure we can talk about it.\" Nervous laugh.</p><p>You can just say yes.</p><p>Schmidt sighs again. The prospect of European governments (and media companies) forming an orderly queue behind the French is obviously one that has occurred to him. He prevaricates: \"The reason I like this model is it's… I don't like the idea of randomly writing cheques to publishers in the old model, and I think it's a very good idea for Google to assist in the transformation of their business model from old to new. So it's a very good positioning.\"</p><p>Change of subject. He wants to return to the future. The book has sections on how domestic life will change – how your mobile phone will make you dinner in the evening while your fridge does your son's homework and your smart lawn mower performs a hip-replacement operation on your husband… that sort of thing. All this from the man who is about to bring you glasses you can talk to. (\"You don't say much to it, by the way.\") The future is going to be great for robots, it turns out – but also, he insists, for human beings, so long as they can become more creative. Which they will.</p><p>But the bigger stuff – on the future of nation states, politics and war, the Balkanisation of the internet – is less familiar. He is particularly exercised about the miniaturisation of war – for example, the prospect of privately owned drones, which have the potential to act as a new type of IED, able to be used in the air or on the ground.</p><p>\"Let me do it as a 'How would you feel?',\" he&nbsp;says. \"You're having a dispute with your neighbour. How would you feel if your neighbour went over and bought a commercial observation drone that they can launch from their back yard. It just flies over your house all day. How would you feel about it?</p><p>\"If you look at the miniaturisation of drones, there will be restrictions on them. I can give you worse examples, but you get the idea. So it's probable that robotics becomes a significant component of nation state warfare. I'm not going to pass judgment on whether armies should exist, but I would prefer to not spread and democratise the ability to fight war to every single human being.</p><p>\"It's got to be regulated. You just can't imagine that British people would allow this sort of thing, and I can't imagine American people would allow this sort of thing. It's one thing for governments, who have some legitimacy in what they're doing,&nbsp;but have other people doing it… It's not going to happen.\"</p><p>I suggest that the question of what you do about bad things that can't be uninvented applies&nbsp;to Google itself. He bridles at the word \"Frankenstein\".</p><p>\"Google is not a bunch of engineers who throw stuff over the wall,\" he says rather stiffly.</p><p>\"A classic example is that a team built a facial-recognition tool. It was just really good – state of the art at the time. We stopped that product for two reasons. One is that it turned out to be illegal in Europe and the second was that it was not a good product to offer in the US for the same reasons. So we didn't do it.\"</p><p>What stopped it in the US?</p><p>\"Our judgment. I made the decision; I was literally in the room.\"</p><p>\"Facial recognition, completely unmonitored, can&nbsp;be used for very bad things. It can be used for stalking, for example. You know, it's just we don't want to be part of that as a company. There are cases where facial recognition can be used, but they need to be fairly carefully boxed. If you look at Facebook, for example, they have this Facebook tagging thing which is essentially face recognition, and they went through a huge cycle where they made it too aggressive. People got freaked out, and then they had to pull back on it. So we're super-sensitive on any of these privacy issues.</p><p>He warns of the dangers of combining London-style traffic cameras with this technology. \"You could imagine the sort of aggressive, obnoxious autocrats saying, 'Well, we need this to keep our people under control', and once those things are in place, they're very hard to turn off. They really are.\"</p><p>His research led him to a conversation with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. He was struck by one \"important\" argument Assange advanced – that systematic evil has to be written down, and therefore can be subverted by leaking. He ponders how events in Hitler's Germany or Rwanda might have been different with the internet. \"So I had sympathy for the Assange intellectual argument, but not sympathy for the implementation.\"</p><p>Why not the implementation, if whistleblowing is an answer to bad things happening?</p><p>His instincts as a cautious Fortune 500 executive chairman kick in. \"I want to be careful about what I'm saying about leaking. This is a minefield.\"</p><p>Pressed further, he picks his words with care: \"The problem is… who gets to decide who does&nbsp;the leaking? Well, Assange's answer was himself,&nbsp;and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision, because it's a pretty weighty&nbsp;decision. \"</p><p>Finally, some questions about Schmidt himself. The announcement that he's soon <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/09/us-google-schmidt-idUSBRE91712W20130209\" title=\"\">selling off 40% of his Google stock</a> has provoked people to suggest his time with the company is coming to an end. \"Completely false.\" Not thinking about a job in government? \"No, never.\"</p><p>Kindle or BlackBerry?</p><p>\"I'm a BlackBerry user. I like the keyboard, although BlackBerry is certainly in trouble.\"</p><p>Facebook or Twitter?</p><p>\"Twitter has a more distinct model because of the celebrity and publishing model. Facebook is in a transition and I don't know enough about what they're transitioning to. I will tell you that, if you have a billion users, you can make money.\"</p><p>Amazon or Apple?</p><p>\"I have a soft spot for Apple. They're both going&nbsp;to do well. Apple will continue to be a tremendous technology innovator and build beautiful products regardless of the market share of the products, and that's a great strength. Amazon has well passed any expectations of its ability to change distribution and marketing.\"</p><p>iPad mini or iPad?</p><p>\"iPad.\"</p><p>You don't like the little one?</p><p>\"It's too small.\"</p><p>That's the point of it!</p><p>\"Take a look at the Samsung 10in tablet called the Nexus.\"</p><p>India or China?</p><p>\"In the short term, China gets all the attention; the maths favours India. And I am a mathematician.\"</p><p>The hang-out comes to an end and the mathematician disappears from my screen, leaving&nbsp;quite a few dreams in the air. And not a few&nbsp;nightmares.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If you were born a hundred years ago, and did anything, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" title=\"\">Google</a> might celebrate you on its search page. It's a random way to remember culture heroes – but better than oblivion.</p><p>Norman Parkinson, who is, as I write, a Google star because he was born on 21 April 1913, is in no danger of oblivion. This <a href=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/57987000/jpg/_57987486_untitled.jpg\" title=\"\">British fashion photographer</a> , who died in 1990, currently has an <a href=\"http://www.normanparkinson.com/\" title=\"\">exhibition of his work</a> at the National Theatre in London and another in Bath:</p><p>his pictures are especially loved and <a href=\"http://materialwhirl.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/fashion-through-a-legendary -lens/\" title=\"\">admired in the world of fashion</a> .</p><p>Parkinson's brilliance has everything to do with time, and defying it – for he managed to be something that should be logically impossible, a \"timeless\" fashion photographer whose art danced through the decades and always <a href=\"http://materialwhirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tumblr_mc3mobcy4r1 qe9qato1_1280.jpg\" title=\"\">remained in style</a>.</p><p>Born just before the first world war, Parkinson lived through a century of extreme change and yet his pictures did not get relegated to yesterday's model. He defined the look of Vogue in the mid-20th century with pictures like his monochrome shot of a <a href=\"http://images.artnet.com/aoa_lot_images/72246/norman-parkinson-le-groux-so eurs-hat-vogue-photographs-silver-print.jpg\" title=\"\">thin lady in a very wide hat</a>. Surely, style like that should have made him old hat when the 1960s, miniskirts and sex blew 50s elegance out of the water, yet Parkinson took stunning images that captured the revolution of the 60s. His <a href=\"http://pleasurephoto.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/traffic-1960-norman-park inson.jpg\" title=\"\">1960 photograph Traffic, Queen</a> is a phenomenal distillation of the new spirit. A woman is posed in front of a moving bus: in a typical Parkinson device, she is in sharp focus while everything else is allowed to blur. The bus becomes an abstract mass of speed – Parkinson's use of colour is scintillating, with the slender model wearing a red cap and black dress and leaning against a black and white pelican-crossing signpost.</p><p></p><h2>Speed, modernity, abstraction – and beauty</h2><p></p><p>Parkinson's eye was kept fresh by the passion for beautiful women that electrifies his photography across the decades. His 1951 Vogue picture <a href=\"http://pleasurephoto.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-art-of-travel-wenda-parkinson-nc3a9e-rogerson-photo-norman-parkinson-1949.jpg\" title=\"\">The Art of Travel</a> has a visionary quality as a superbly elegant adventurer walks across a remote wild landscape towards her waiting plane: she is an unforgettable dream image.</p><p>This rapturous sense of glamour never left him. In 1975, he photographed <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxPt1HtXOM/UV1YrqbN4TI/AAAAAAAAE_k/7mSc4vKiv5g /s1600/normanparkinson7.jpg\" title=\"\">Jerry Hall </a>standing on a stone pedestal, preparing to dive into shallow water: he reveals the strong grace of her body in a frozen moment of surreal formality. The picture fascinated <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/Roxysiren.jpg\" title=\"\">Brian Ferry</a>, who got Hall to pose for a Roxy Music album cover and became her boyfriend.</p><p>Parkinson in his 60s was still able to craft pop icons.

If you were born a hundred years ago, and did anything, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" title=\"\">Google</a> might celebrate you on its search page. It's a random way to remember culture heroes – but better than oblivion.</p><p>Norman Parkinson, who is, as I write, a Google star because he was born on 21 April 1913, is in no danger of oblivion. This <a href=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/57987000/jpg/_57987486_untitled.jpg\" title=\"\">British fashion photographer</a> , who died in 1990, currently has an <a href=\"http://www.normanparkinson.com/\" title=\"\">exhibition of his work</a> at the National Theatre in London and another in Bath:</p><p>his pictures are especially loved and <a href=\"http://materialwhirl.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/fashion-through-a-legendary -lens/\" title=\"\">admired in the world of fashion</a> .</p><p>Parkinson's brilliance has everything to do with time, and defying it – for he managed to be something that should be logically impossible, a \"timeless\" fashion photographer whose art danced through the decades and always <a href=\"http://materialwhirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tumblr_mc3mobcy4r1 qe9qato1_1280.jpg\" title=\"\">remained in style</a>.</p><p>Born just before the first world war, Parkinson lived through a century of extreme change and yet his pictures did not get relegated to yesterday's model. He defined the look of Vogue in the mid-20th century with pictures like his monochrome shot of a <a href=\"http://images.artnet.com/aoa_lot_images/72246/norman-parkinson-le-groux-so eurs-hat-vogue-photographs-silver-print.jpg\" title=\"\">thin lady in a very wide hat</a>. Surely, style like that should have made him old hat when the 1960s, miniskirts and sex blew 50s elegance out of the water, yet Parkinson took stunning images that captured the revolution of the 60s. His <a href=\"http://pleasurephoto.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/traffic-1960-norman-park inson.jpg\" title=\"\">1960 photograph Traffic, Queen</a> is a phenomenal distillation of the new spirit. A woman is posed in front of a moving bus: in a typical Parkinson device, she is in sharp focus while everything else is allowed to blur. The bus becomes an abstract mass of speed – Parkinson's use of colour is scintillating, with the slender model wearing a red cap and black dress and leaning against a black and white pelican-crossing signpost.</p><p></p><h2>Speed, modernity, abstraction – and beauty</h2><p></p><p>Parkinson's eye was kept fresh by the passion for beautiful women that electrifies his photography across the decades. His 1951 Vogue picture <a href=\"http://pleasurephoto.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/the-art-of-travel-wenda-parkinson-nc3a9e-rogerson-photo-norman-parkinson-1949.jpg\" title=\"\">The Art of Travel</a> has a visionary quality as a superbly elegant adventurer walks across a remote wild landscape towards her waiting plane: she is an unforgettable dream image.</p><p>This rapturous sense of glamour never left him. In 1975, he photographed <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-koxPt1HtXOM/UV1YrqbN4TI/AAAAAAAAE_k/7mSc4vKiv5g /s1600/normanparkinson7.jpg\" title=\"\">Jerry Hall </a>standing on a stone pedestal, preparing to dive into shallow water: he reveals the strong grace of her body in a frozen moment of surreal formality. The picture fascinated <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/Roxysiren.jpg\" title=\"\">Brian Ferry</a>, who got Hall to pose for a Roxy Music album cover and became her boyfriend.</p><p>Parkinson in his 60s was still able to craft pop icons.

In his day job, he has pioneered painstaking research into the binding properties of molecules and contributed extensively to understanding the particular influences on ion channel function in the development of drugs. In his after-hours alter ego, however, he is the take-no-prisoners scourge of quackery and mumbo-jumbo in his unmissable blog, <a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/\" title=\"\">DC's Improbable Science</a>.</p><p>For a decade or more, no homeopath or acupuncturist has been safe from Professor Colquhoun's scathing, and often comic, online analysis. No newspaper report of the latest carcinogen – sausages or coffee or cheese – can survive his statistical scrutiny. He wages rigorous war against the march of managerialism and corporate speak through academia and the NHS. And, at 76, you would have to say he rather enjoys it.</p><p>Sitting in his office at UCL, surrounded by shelves of box files yellowed with the smoke of the pipe that was always a necessary accompaniment to his algebra, he dwells with some amusement on the two halves of his public life. \"I once wrote a textbook on statistics, which has been enormously useful to me in many ways,\" he says. \"But that book, though pretty well received, sold 5,000 copies over several years. The latest blog I did on the Department of Health had 7,000 hits in three days. I have to say it is fun to have a big audience. All my life, I have been writing papers that have been read by a handful of people around the world. I love the science and I remain addicted to stochastic processes, but to write something that gets picked up on Twitter and has an immediate response is a different kind of addiction. If I get asked to go to a university these days to speak they ask me to do a seminar on ion channels and another on management gobbledegook or something. One gets a dozen committed students, the other fills a large lecture hall…\"</p><p>The General Medical Council currently requires all medical students to be familiarised with alternative medicine as part of their studies. Some universities apparently ask practising homeopaths to conduct this briefing; others, such as King's in London, invite Colquhoun. \"I tend,\" he says, with a guffaw, \"to give them a version of my '<a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733\" title=\"\">Patient's Guide to Magic Medicine</a>', which was originally written as a response to the witterings of the Prince of Wales on the subject.\"</p><p>Colquhoun's guide is a <em>Devil's Dictionary</em> of all things holistic: \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety… Reflexology: plain old foot massage, overlaid with utter nonsense about non-existent connections between your feet and your thyroid gland… Spiritual healing: tea and sympathy, accompanied by arm-waving… Kinesiology, iridology, vega test, etc: various forms of fraud, designed to sell you cures that don't work, for problems you haven't got.\" And so on.</p><p>Colquhoun has lately won a series of victories against what he calls the \"endarkenment\" of healthcare. After lodging a freedom of information request, he obtained the background correspondence from the prince's homeopathic charity that apparently influenced the creation of an infamous page on alternative treatments on the NHS Choices web page. Colquhoun subsequently gained an admission that the advice had \"let down the general public\" and a reworking of the page to include the wording: <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">\"There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition…\"</a> Also long in his sights have been the universities that offer MSc qualifications in anti-science. \"I discovered for example that 'amethysts emit high yin energy' was being taught as part of a BSc at Westminster just down the road.\" As a result of the attention brought by his blog, science degrees in homeopathy are a thing of the past in British universities.</p><p>Inevitably, none of this has been achieved without some fallout. After protracted complaints by one herbalist to the provost of UCL, Colquhoun was quietly, and outrageously, asked to remove his blog from the university site in 2007. When he did so, \"all hell broke loose\" <a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2007/06/the-mighty-david-colquhoun/\" title=\"\">after a column by Ben Goldacre</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> exposed the academic cowardice of the university hierarchy. No stranger to lawyers, Colquhoun now worries that unless the much-debated defamation bill is passed, legitimate scientific opinion will continue to be suppressed by anyone with money.</p><p>At the same time, he hopes that the \"fashion for irrationality\", which he dates back to the Beatles going to India \"when flower power stopped being fun and started being mystical bollocks\", may be fading. His abiding hero is Bertrand Russell, and he laces his conversation with favourite quotes, including Russell's maxim that \"it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true\".</p><p>Colquhoun ascribes some of his critical scepticism to his father, the only boy from Birkenhead to get a scholarship to Liverpool University in his year in the 1920s, who went on to become a schoolmaster, teaching languages to Harold Wilson and the geneticist Steve Jones among others. Colquhoun was hopeless at school and started to make his mark as an academic only after a miserable couple of years as an apprentice pharmacist in a branch of Timothy Whites & Taylors chemists in&nbsp;Birkenhead.</p><p>Having eventually gained tenure at UCL in the 60s, he devoted himself to solving the \"affinity-efficacy problem\". This dwelt on the idea that if \"drug design is to become rational, it is essential to be able to measure separately the binding affinity of the drug for its receptor and the effectiveness of the drug in opening an ion channel once it has bound\".</p><p>The only way to solve the problem was by measurement of single molecules. In collaboration with Alan Hawkes, the necessary mathematics was worked out for the interpretation of experiments done initially with Bert Sakmann, who, with Erwin Neher, got the Nobel prize in 1991 for discovering how to record from single molecules. \"I don't think drug design will become fully rational in my lifetime,\" Colquhoun says. \"But I have tried to make a small contribution to that long-term goal.\"</p><p>He doesn't link the two halves of his career very closely in his own mind, but talking to him you can see clearly how one has fuelled the other. Having spent half a lifetime trying to establish the smallest conceivable causalities at the molecular level, you can well imagine his righteous frustration when policy-makers disregard evidence-based models entirely in putting forward advice in relation to health or diet or anything else.</p><p>\"People simply still don't get that to prove 'effect B' is caused by 'intervention A', you have to use randomised controlled testing,\" he says.</p><p>In his current semi-retirement, Colquhoun was hoping to complete a book on the mathematical and statistical principles of pharmacology, but he worries the sheer irrationality of the world might yet prevent him. \"There is so much to do on the blog,\" he says, both cheerfully and guiltily, \"that I fear that might get in the way…\"</p><h2><strong>Ten questions for </strong>David Colquhoun</h2><p><strong>What is the most exciting field of science at the moment?</strong></p><p>Too often what's trendy now turns out not to live up to its promise. Predictions are impossible: that's why it's called research.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you believe in a God?</strong></p><p>Not since I was 15. A nurse took me to an Easter mass, which struck me as a sadomasochistic orgy (of course I didn't know then that so many priests acted out their perversities).

But be realistic about career prospects. At the moment they are lousy.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you have a fantasy experiment or study that you have been unable to do for logistical/ethical/cost reasons?</strong></p><p>No. Single ion channel biophysics is cheap compared with many areas. The limitation is my brain, not cost.</p><p></p><p><strong>What scientific advance would make the most difference to your daily life?</strong></p><p>Factors that limit my daily life are not to do with lack of science (unless you count the inability of medicine to fix my spine).</p><p></p><p><strong>Outside of your work, do you live an evidence-based life?</strong></p><p>Yes, I think so. The exception is my pipe, without which I can't do algebra (or much else).</p><p></p><p><strong>Why do so few scientists enter politics?</strong></p><p>Because science is one of very few occupations where you can put honesty above expediency (though even in science that doesn't always happen). That being said, the lack of scientific education among politicians is scary.

In his day job, he has pioneered painstaking research into the binding properties of molecules and contributed extensively to understanding the particular influences on ion channel function in the development of drugs. In his after-hours alter ego, however, he is the take-no-prisoners scourge of quackery and mumbo-jumbo in his unmissable blog, <a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/\" title=\"\">DC's Improbable Science</a>.</p><p>For a decade or more, no homeopath or acupuncturist has been safe from Professor Colquhoun's scathing, and often comic, online analysis. No newspaper report of the latest carcinogen – sausages or coffee or cheese – can survive his statistical scrutiny. He wages rigorous war against the march of managerialism and corporate speak through academia and the NHS. And, at 76, you would have to say he rather enjoys it.</p><p>Sitting in his office at UCL, surrounded by shelves of box files yellowed with the smoke of the pipe that was always a necessary accompaniment to his algebra, he dwells with some amusement on the two halves of his public life. \"I once wrote a textbook on statistics, which has been enormously useful to me in many ways,\" he says. \"But that book, though pretty well received, sold 5,000 copies over several years. The latest blog I did on the Department of Health had 7,000 hits in three days. I have to say it is fun to have a big audience. All my life, I have been writing papers that have been read by a handful of people around the world. I love the science and I remain addicted to stochastic processes, but to write something that gets picked up on Twitter and has an immediate response is a different kind of addiction. If I get asked to go to a university these days to speak they ask me to do a seminar on ion channels and another on management gobbledegook or something. One gets a dozen committed students, the other fills a large lecture hall…\"</p><p>The General Medical Council currently requires all medical students to be familiarised with alternative medicine as part of their studies. Some universities apparently ask practising homeopaths to conduct this briefing; others, such as King's in London, invite Colquhoun. \"I tend,\" he says, with a guffaw, \"to give them a version of my '<a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733\" title=\"\">Patient's Guide to Magic Medicine</a>', which was originally written as a response to the witterings of the Prince of Wales on the subject.\"</p><p>Colquhoun's guide is a <em>Devil's Dictionary</em> of all things holistic: \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety… Reflexology: plain old foot massage, overlaid with utter nonsense about non-existent connections between your feet and your thyroid gland… Spiritual healing: tea and sympathy, accompanied by arm-waving… Kinesiology, iridology, vega test, etc: various forms of fraud, designed to sell you cures that don't work, for problems you haven't got.\" And so on.</p><p>Colquhoun has lately won a series of victories against what he calls the \"endarkenment\" of healthcare. After lodging a freedom of information request, he obtained the background correspondence from the prince's homeopathic charity that apparently influenced the creation of an infamous page on alternative treatments on the NHS Choices web page. Colquhoun subsequently gained an admission that the advice had \"let down the general public\" and a reworking of the page to include the wording: <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">\"There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition…\"</a> Also long in his sights have been the universities that offer MSc qualifications in anti-science. \"I discovered for example that 'amethysts emit high yin energy' was being taught as part of a BSc at Westminster just down the road.\" As a result of the attention brought by his blog, science degrees in homeopathy are a thing of the past in British universities.</p><p>Inevitably, none of this has been achieved without some fallout. After protracted complaints by one herbalist to the provost of UCL, Colquhoun was quietly, and outrageously, asked to remove his blog from the university site in 2007. When he did so, \"all hell broke loose\" <a href=\"http://www.badscience.net/2007/06/the-mighty-david-colquhoun/\" title=\"\">after a column by Ben Goldacre</a> in the <em>Guardian</em> exposed the academic cowardice of the university hierarchy. No stranger to lawyers, Colquhoun now worries that unless the much-debated defamation bill is passed, legitimate scientific opinion will continue to be suppressed by anyone with money.</p><p>At the same time, he hopes that the \"fashion for irrationality\", which he dates back to the Beatles going to India \"when flower power stopped being fun and started being mystical bollocks\", may be fading. His abiding hero is Bertrand Russell, and he laces his conversation with favourite quotes, including Russell's maxim that \"it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true\".</p><p>Colquhoun ascribes some of his critical scepticism to his father, the only boy from Birkenhead to get a scholarship to Liverpool University in his year in the 1920s, who went on to become a schoolmaster, teaching languages to Harold Wilson and the geneticist Steve Jones among others. Colquhoun was hopeless at school and started to make his mark as an academic only after a miserable couple of years as an apprentice pharmacist in a branch of Timothy Whites & Taylors chemists in&nbsp;Birkenhead.</p><p>Having eventually gained tenure at UCL in the 60s, he devoted himself to solving the \"affinity-efficacy problem\". This dwelt on the idea that if \"drug design is to become rational, it is essential to be able to measure separately the binding affinity of the drug for its receptor and the effectiveness of the drug in opening an ion channel once it has bound\".</p><p>The only way to solve the problem was by measurement of single molecules. In collaboration with Alan Hawkes, the necessary mathematics was worked out for the interpretation of experiments done initially with Bert Sakmann, who, with Erwin Neher, got the Nobel prize in 1991 for discovering how to record from single molecules. \"I don't think drug design will become fully rational in my lifetime,\" Colquhoun says. \"But I have tried to make a small contribution to that long-term goal.\"</p><p>He doesn't link the two halves of his career very closely in his own mind, but talking to him you can see clearly how one has fuelled the other. Having spent half a lifetime trying to establish the smallest conceivable causalities at the molecular level, you can well imagine his righteous frustration when policy-makers disregard evidence-based models entirely in putting forward advice in relation to health or diet or anything else.</p><p>\"People simply still don't get that to prove 'effect B' is caused by 'intervention A', you have to use randomised controlled testing,\" he says.</p><p>In his current semi-retirement, Colquhoun was hoping to complete a book on the mathematical and statistical principles of pharmacology, but he worries the sheer irrationality of the world might yet prevent him. \"There is so much to do on the blog,\" he says, both cheerfully and guiltily, \"that I fear that might get in the way…\"</p><h2><strong>Ten questions for </strong>David Colquhoun</h2><p><strong>What is the most exciting field of science at the moment?</strong></p><p>Too often what's trendy now turns out not to live up to its promise.

A nurse took me to an Easter mass, which struck me as a sadomasochistic orgy (of course I didn't know then that so many priests acted out their perversities).

His aim was to distil into a set of elegant essays everything he had learned from the OS/360 experience. The striking title came from his epiphany – the realisation that man-months are a hopeless metric for assessing the size of a complex software project.</p><p>Why? Basically because a big software project involves two kinds of work: the actual writing of computer code; and co-ordinating the work of the dozens – or maybe hundreds – of programmers working on different parts of the overall system. Co-ordination represents an essential but unproductive overhead: and the more programmers you have, the bigger that overhead becomes. Hence Brooks's law: adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p><p>Over the years, fragments of Fred Brooks's wisdom have percolated into the consciousness of ministers, civil servants and chief executives. But only fragments. In Britain we are wearily familiar with the long, dreary catalogue of botched or outlandishly expensive government IT projects. This is not just a public sector problem, however. Research conducted by two Oxford academics and <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0265v1.pdf\" title=\"\">published in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> suggests that the private sector has almost as much difficulty managing big software projects, and that some such projects have even endangered the survival of the companies that embarked upon them.</p><p>A case in point was the venerable clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss. In 2003 it was a global corporation, with operations in more than 110 countries but with an IT system that was an antiquated, \"Balkanised\" mix of incompatible country-specific systems. So its bosses decided to migrate to a single SAP system and hired a team of fancy consultants (from Deloitte) to lead the effort. \"The risks seemed small,\" wrote the researchers. \"The proposed budget was less than $5m.\" But very quickly things fell apart. One major customer, Walmart, required that the system interface with its supply chain management system, creating additional work. During the switchover to the new system, Levi Strauss was unable to fulfil orders and had to close its three US distribution centres for a week. In 2008, the company took a $192.5m charge against earnings to compensate for the botched project — and fired its chief information officer.</p><p>The Oxford researchers examined more than 1,400 big IT projects – comparing their budgets and estimated performance benefits with the actual costs and results. The average project cost $167m and the largest a whopping $33bn. The researchers' sample drew heavily on US-based projects but found little difference between them and European projects. Likewise, they found little difference between private companies and public agencies. One in six had a cost overrun of 200%.</p><p>The message is clear: if you run a big company or a government department and are contemplating a big IT product, ask yourself this question: can your company or your ministerial career survive if the project goes over budget by 40% or more, or if only 25-50% of the projected benefits are realised? If the answer is \"no\" go back to square one. And read Fred Brooks's lovely book.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/software\">Software</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing\">Computing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/management\">Management</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnnaughton\">John Naughton</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But only fragments. In Britain we are wearily familiar with the long, dreary catalogue of botched or outlandishly expensive government IT projects. This is not just a public sector problem, however. Research conducted by two Oxford academics and <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0265v1.pdf\" title=\"\">published in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> suggests that the private sector has almost as much difficulty managing big software projects, and that some such projects have even endangered the survival of the companies that embarked upon them.</p><p>A case in point was the venerable clothing manufacturer Levi Strauss. In 2003 it was a global corporation, with operations in more than 110 countries but with an IT system that was an antiquated, \"Balkanised\" mix of incompatible country-specific systems. So its bosses decided to migrate to a single SAP system and hired a team of fancy consultants (from Deloitte) to lead the effort. \"The risks seemed small,\" wrote the researchers. \"The proposed budget was less than $5m.\" But very quickly things fell apart. One major customer, Walmart, required that the system interface with its supply chain management system, creating additional work. During the switchover to the new system, Levi Strauss was unable to fulfil orders and had to close its three US distribution centres for a week. In 2008, the company took a $192.5m charge against earnings to compensate for the botched project — and fired its chief information officer.</p><p>The Oxford researchers examined more than 1,400 big IT projects – comparing their budgets and estimated performance benefits with the actual costs and results. The average project cost $167m and the largest a whopping $33bn. The researchers' sample drew heavily on US-based projects but found little difference between them and European projects. Likewise, they found little difference between private companies and public agencies. One in six had a cost overrun of 200%.</p><p>The message is clear: if you run a big company or a government department and are contemplating a big IT product, ask yourself this question: can your company or your ministerial career survive if the project goes over budget by 40% or more, or if only 25-50% of the projected benefits are realised? If the answer is \"no\" go back to square one. And read Fred Brooks's lovely book.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/software\">Software</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing\">Computing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/management\">Management</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnnaughton\">John Naughton</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's a broadly interesting story concerning the struggle for survival on a near-future Earth ravaged by an inconclusive war between humans and an alien alliance called Votans.</p><p>Players take on the role of an Ark Hunter, a scavenger for hire scouring the San Francisco wasteland in search of useful relics from the decaying Votan fleet breaking up in low orbit.

On Monday, I manned a busy beach bar and had to remember a range of ice-cream and pizza orders for a constant stream of customers.</p><p>On Tuesday, I had to shoot down a selection of rapidly moving birds in a forest dense with autumnal leaves. On Wednesday, I had to think of as many words as I could beginning with \"TO\". And that was before I'd even started on memorising a repetitive polygon shape as it flashed up at ever-increasing speed.</p><p>This is the wonderful world of \"brain training\". For the past month, I have been completing a series of computer games designed to test my memory, verbal reasoning, concentration and spatial awareness. The beach bar was made out of pixels. The birds were shot down with the click of a mouse. It turns out there are loads of words beginning with TO, many of which I hadn't guessed in the requisite 60-second time.</p><p>According to the website for <a href=\"http://www.lumosity.com/\" title=\"\">Lumosity</a>, which devised these games and is one of the best-known internet providers of brain training, setting aside a few minutes each day to complete the above tasks can make you feel \"smarter, sharper, and brighter\". By factoring in a mental workout in the same way that we might go to the gym to exercise, we get cleverer and our IQ rockets.</p><p>That, at least, is the idea. And there are lots of people who buy it. In recent years, brain training has become a multimillion-pound business with companies such as <a href=\"http://junglememory.com/\" title=\"\">Jungle Memory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nintendo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cognifit.com/\" title=\"\">CogniFit</a> developing a wide range of user-friendly neuroscientific puzzles for the average punter. Lumosity itself has grown by 150% year-on-year since its launch in 2005 and now reaches more than 35 million people worldwide. In January alone, the company's mobile app was downloaded nearly 50,000 times a day and its revenue hit $24m (£16m).</p><p>Co-founded by Michael Scanlon <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/lumosity/\" title=\"\">after he abandoned his neuroscience PhD at Stanford University, California</a>, the business also has an extensive research programme that studies the effects of computerised cognitive training as well as conducting experiments over the web.</p><p>\"Lumosity is based on the science of neuroplasticity, the idea that the brain can change and reorganise itself given the right kinds of challenges,\" says Erica Perng, Lumosity's head of communications. \"People have a variety of reasons for wanting to boost their brain power, whether it's to focus at work, do better at school and standardised tests, or just to stay sharp.\"</p><p>In the US, brain-training programmes are used in schools, at a cost of up to $300 per child. Some ambitious parents on this side of the Atlantic have started using the games in place of hiring a private tutor to improve their children's academic scores. And there is anecdotal evidence that keeping a brain lively is helpful in staving off early-onset dementia.</p><p>But do such initiatives have any kind of scientific basis? The evidence appears to be contradictory. A <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105.abstract\" title=\"\">2008 study</a> by the psychologist Susanne Jaeggi found that memory training increased intelligence and implied that a person could boost their IQ by a full point per hour of training. However, when a group of psychologists working at Georgia Tech <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22708717\" title=\"\">set out to replicate her findings</a> with tougher controls, there was no evidence for a rise in intelligence.</p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20407435\" title=\"\">2010 study</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/neurophilosophy/2011/sep/02/detecting-covert-consciousness-vegetative-state\" title=\"\">neuroscientist Dr Adrian Owen</a>, which tracked 11,000 adults over a six-week computer-based training regime designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention, reported benefits in executing the tasks themselves but little general advantage in other areas.</p><p>Owen concluded that regular players of brain games got better at the games themselves through familiarity rather than showing any marked improvement in <a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/article/4293671/finding-work-a-guide-for-the-over-40s/\" title=\"\">fluid intelligence </a>(the ability to solve novel problems and adapt to new situations as opposed to accumulating knowledge).</p><p>In an attempt to sort out the hype from the reality, I embarked on my own experiment – albeit an experiment with an unimpressive cohort of one and without the controls that would be necessary to get the results peer-reviewed in any respectable scientific publication.</p><p>The idea was that I'd measure my intelligence at the start of the month using a <a href=\"http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/challenge/introduction\" title=\"\">variety of tests developed by the Medical Research Council at Cambridge University</a>, designed to give a more sophisticated take on the brain's 100bn neurons than a single IQ test. I would then embark on a rigorous routine of brain training with Lumosity, doing regular exercises designed to make me journalism's answer to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/hawking\" title=\"\">Professor Stephen Hawking</a>. At the end of the month, I'd take the intelligence tests again and see if there was any improvement.</p><p>\"I think it is a fascinating idea,\" said Dr Adam Hampshire, who developed the MRC tests. \"It really gets to the nub of the issue, which is that showing improvements on the exact tasks that are trained is not really sufficient to claim a 'brain-training' effect. This is because such improvements may be specific to the exact tasks that are trained and consequently should not be classified as learning unless a generalised effect is shown.</p><p>\"I am unaware of any convincing evidence to support the view that the commercially available brain-training devices have general benefits in normal healthy adults.\"</p><p>Sitting down to take the initial intelligence test, I am fairly confident. I have a degree and good A-levels. Occasionally, I even get a few questions right on <em>University Challenge</em>. But it turns out to be much harder than expected: a battery of complex, time-pressure tests involving flashing shapes (trying to work out which overlapping triangles are exactly the same size) and long number sequences. One of them, called \"Double Trouble\" requires me to identify the colour a particular word is written in. Which sounds easy, until you realise that the words in question are \"red\", written in blue, or \"blue\", written in red. Even trying to explain the games to someone else taxes my intelligence.</p><p>The process isn't helped by the fact that I'm at work and keep getting interrupted by colleagues who, not unreasonably, assume that I'm simply time-wasting. The excuse \"Actually, I'm training my brain\" doesn't cut much ice in a busy newsroom. My scores, when they are calculated, are pretty pathetic. I'm in the top half of the population for planning. My concentration needs some work (top 26%). My reasoning is well above average (top 15%) and my memory is… so bad I can't even remember what I scored.</p><p>I take a couple of days to recover and then I sign up to Lumosity. The Lumosity games are far less intimidating. An effort has been made to make them entertaining rather than hardcore versions of the 11-plus. They are short and sweet and include plenty of encouragement – gold stars leap across the screen when I do something right. Having said that, it's difficult to fit a 20-minute session into my daily life. I don't find the games sufficiently interesting to get out of bed and do them each morning, so my training is rather sporadic – more like once a week than once every 24 hours.</p><p>But regular monitoring of my performance by Lumosity shows that I gradually improve in all the games the more I play them. Unsurprising, says David Z Hambrick, associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University. In an <a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/q-a-new-evidence-shows-brain-training-games-dont-work/11758\" title=\"\">interview last year, Hambrick</a> said brain-training games are \"designed to tap into this ability to control attention. Their idea is that if we can improve the ability to control attention then we can, by extension, improve people's intelligence... [but] if you find that people get better in one test of reasoning, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're smart; it means they're better on one test of reasoning.\"</p><p>Most research that suggests brain-training works is <a href=\"http://psychfiledrawer.org/topics/view.php?t=brain-training--far-transfer-effects-643-763\" title=\"\">fraught with difficulties:</a> little has been peer-reviewed or conducted alongside control groups. Several companies use scans of brains \"lighting up\" to support claims that their programmes are effective, but these simply show a measure of the energy that the brain is using rather than providing any evidence that the brain is being altered in any long-term way. Moreover, it is unclear whether training benefits are only evident for certain sectors of the population – for example children, patients or older people.</p><p>\"Overall, I would suggest that more research is needed,\" says Hampshire. \"Some people have been motivated by greed to try and cash in early by selling poorly thought-out and insufficiently validated brain-training devices. They have flashy marketing but little data to back up their claims. There is tantalising evidence to suggest that, when properly validated cognitive training regimes are developed, they may have some general benefits.\"</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/retrieve/pii/S0896627312005843\" title=\"\">Hampshire published research </a>showing that out of 44,600 individuals who took an earlier version of the MRC tests, those who had regularly brain-trained showed no advantage in any form of intelligence relative to those who did not. By contrast, those who regularly played video games did better in short-term memory capacity and reasoning.</p><p>\"This is an interesting finding because it is really counter to the general zeitgeist that video computer games are bad for us whereas we should all be investing in brain-training devices,\" he says. \"We might just be better off spending our money on a new video games console!\"</p><p>So how do I fare when I return to measure my intelligence at the end of a month of weekly training with Lumosity? Fairly well, it turns out. I have improved in every single test apart from one (\"Monkey Ladder\", where I need to remember an ever-increasing sequence of coloured tiles in order), in which I score exactly the same. In \"Double Trouble\" – the pesky red/blue words – I have soared from 33 points to 51, putting me in the top 6% of the population for reasoning.</p><p>Overall, I'm now in the top 29% of the population for short-term memory and the top 13% for concentration. My planning skills have stayed more or less static. Although I'm happy that I'm now supposedly more intelligent than when I started, part of me remains sceptical. I was taking the end tests in a different context: at home, with a mug of strong coffee and no other distractions. And, arguably, it was the second time I was taking the tests, so I was therefore more familiar with them.</p><p>There's also the fact that I wanted to get better, so perhaps I tried harder, in much the same way that paying for a monthly gym membership is likely to make you feel more motivated to exercise.

On Monday, I manned a busy beach bar and had to remember a range of ice-cream and pizza orders for a constant stream of customers.</p><p>On Tuesday, I had to shoot down a selection of rapidly moving birds in a forest dense with autumnal leaves. On Wednesday, I had to think of as many words as I could beginning with \"TO\". And that was before I'd even started on memorising a repetitive polygon shape as it flashed up at ever-increasing speed.</p><p>This is the wonderful world of \"brain training\". For the past month, I have been completing a series of computer games designed to test my memory, verbal reasoning, concentration and spatial awareness. The beach bar was made out of pixels. The birds were shot down with the click of a mouse. It turns out there are loads of words beginning with TO, many of which I hadn't guessed in the requisite 60-second time.</p><p>According to the website for <a href=\"http://www.lumosity.com/\" title=\"\">Lumosity</a>, which devised these games and is one of the best-known internet providers of brain training, setting aside a few minutes each day to complete the above tasks can make you feel \"smarter, sharper, and brighter\". By factoring in a mental workout in the same way that we might go to the gym to exercise, we get cleverer and our IQ rockets.</p><p>That, at least, is the idea. And there are lots of people who buy it. In recent years, brain training has become a multimillion-pound business with companies such as <a href=\"http://junglememory.com/\" title=\"\">Jungle Memory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nintendo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cognifit.com/\" title=\"\">CogniFit</a> developing a wide range of user-friendly neuroscientific puzzles for the average punter. Lumosity itself has grown by 150% year-on-year since its launch in 2005 and now reaches more than 35 million people worldwide. In January alone, the company's mobile app was downloaded nearly 50,000 times a day and its revenue hit $24m (£16m).</p><p>Co-founded by Michael Scanlon <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/lumosity/\" title=\"\">after he abandoned his neuroscience PhD at Stanford University, California</a>, the business also has an extensive research programme that studies the effects of computerised cognitive training as well as conducting experiments over the web.</p><p>\"Lumosity is based on the science of neuroplasticity, the idea that the brain can change and reorganise itself given the right kinds of challenges,\" says Erica Perng, Lumosity's head of communications. \"People have a variety of reasons for wanting to boost their brain power, whether it's to focus at work, do better at school and standardised tests, or just to stay sharp.\"</p><p>In the US, brain-training programmes are used in schools, at a cost of up to $300 per child. Some ambitious parents on this side of the Atlantic have started using the games in place of hiring a private tutor to improve their children's academic scores. And there is anecdotal evidence that keeping a brain lively is helpful in staving off early-onset dementia.</p><p>But do such initiatives have any kind of scientific basis? The evidence appears to be contradictory. A <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105.abstract\" title=\"\">2008 study</a> by the psychologist Susanne Jaeggi found that memory training increased intelligence and implied that a person could boost their IQ by a full point per hour of training. However, when a group of psychologists working at Georgia Tech <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22708717\" title=\"\">set out to replicate her findings</a> with tougher controls, there was no evidence for a rise in intelligence.</p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20407435\" title=\"\">2010 study</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/neurophilosophy/2011/sep/02/detecting-covert-consciousness-vegetative-state\" title=\"\">neuroscientist Dr Adrian Owen</a>, which tracked 11,000 adults over a six-week computer-based training regime designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention, reported benefits in executing the tasks themselves but little general advantage in other areas.</p><p>Owen concluded that regular players of brain games got better at the games themselves through familiarity rather than showing any marked improvement in <a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/article/4293671/finding-work-a-guide-for-the-over-40s/\" title=\"\">fluid intelligence </a>(the ability to solve novel problems and adapt to new situations as opposed to accumulating knowledge).</p><p>In an attempt to sort out the hype from the reality, I embarked on my own experiment – albeit an experiment with an unimpressive cohort of one and without the controls that would be necessary to get the results peer-reviewed in any respectable scientific publication.</p><p>The idea was that I'd measure my intelligence at the start of the month using a <a href=\"http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/challenge/introduction\" title=\"\">variety of tests developed by the Medical Research Council at Cambridge University</a>, designed to give a more sophisticated take on the brain's 100bn neurons than a single IQ test. I would then embark on a rigorous routine of brain training with Lumosity, doing regular exercises designed to make me journalism's answer to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/hawking\" title=\"\">Professor Stephen Hawking</a>. At the end of the month, I'd take the intelligence tests again and see if there was any improvement.</p><p>\"I think it is a fascinating idea,\" said Dr Adam Hampshire, who developed the MRC tests. \"It really gets to the nub of the issue, which is that showing improvements on the exact tasks that are trained is not really sufficient to claim a 'brain-training' effect. This is because such improvements may be specific to the exact tasks that are trained and consequently should not be classified as learning unless a generalised effect is shown.</p><p>\"I am unaware of any convincing evidence to support the view that the commercially available brain-training devices have general benefits in normal healthy adults.\"</p><p>Sitting down to take the initial intelligence test, I am fairly confident. I have a degree and good A-levels. Occasionally, I even get a few questions right on <em>University Challenge</em>. But it turns out to be much harder than expected: a battery of complex, time-pressure tests involving flashing shapes (trying to work out which overlapping triangles are exactly the same size) and long number sequences. One of them, called \"Double Trouble\" requires me to identify the colour a particular word is written in. Which sounds easy, until you realise that the words in question are \"red\", written in blue, or \"blue\", written in red. Even trying to explain the games to someone else taxes my intelligence.</p><p>The process isn't helped by the fact that I'm at work and keep getting interrupted by colleagues who, not unreasonably, assume that I'm simply time-wasting. The excuse \"Actually, I'm training my brain\" doesn't cut much ice in a busy newsroom. My scores, when they are calculated, are pretty pathetic. I'm in the top half of the population for planning. My concentration needs some work (top 26%). My reasoning is well above average (top 15%) and my memory is… so bad I can't even remember what I scored.</p><p>I take a couple of days to recover and then I sign up to Lumosity. The Lumosity games are far less intimidating. An effort has been made to make them entertaining rather than hardcore versions of the 11-plus. They are short and sweet and include plenty of encouragement – gold stars leap across the screen when I do something right. Having said that, it's difficult to fit a 20-minute session into my daily life. I don't find the games sufficiently interesting to get out of bed and do them each morning, so my training is rather sporadic – more like once a week than once every 24 hours.</p><p>But regular monitoring of my performance by Lumosity shows that I gradually improve in all the games the more I play them. Unsurprising, says David Z Hambrick, associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University. In an <a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/q-a-new-evidence-shows-brain-training-games-dont-work/11758\" title=\"\">interview last year, Hambrick</a> said brain-training games are \"designed to tap into this ability to control attention. Their idea is that if we can improve the ability to control attention then we can, by extension, improve people's intelligence... [but] if you find that people get better in one test of reasoning, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're smart; it means they're better on one test of reasoning.\"</p><p>Most research that suggests brain-training works is <a href=\"http://psychfiledrawer.org/topics/view.php?t=brain-training--far-transfer-effects-643-763\" title=\"\">fraught with difficulties:</a> little has been peer-reviewed or conducted alongside control groups. Several companies use scans of brains \"lighting up\" to support claims that their programmes are effective, but these simply show a measure of the energy that the brain is using rather than providing any evidence that the brain is being altered in any long-term way. Moreover, it is unclear whether training benefits are only evident for certain sectors of the population – for example children, patients or older people.</p><p>\"Overall, I would suggest that more research is needed,\" says Hampshire. \"Some people have been motivated by greed to try and cash in early by selling poorly thought-out and insufficiently validated brain-training devices. They have flashy marketing but little data to back up their claims. There is tantalising evidence to suggest that, when properly validated cognitive training regimes are developed, they may have some general benefits.\"</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/retrieve/pii/S0896627312005843\" title=\"\">Hampshire published research </a>showing that out of 44,600 individuals who took an earlier version of the MRC tests, those who had regularly brain-trained showed no advantage in any form of intelligence relative to those who did not. By contrast, those who regularly played video games did better in short-term memory capacity and reasoning.</p><p>\"This is an interesting finding because it is really counter to the general zeitgeist that video computer games are bad for us whereas we should all be investing in brain-training devices,\" he says. \"We might just be better off spending our money on a new video games console!\"</p><p>So how do I fare when I return to measure my intelligence at the end of a month of weekly training with Lumosity? Fairly well, it turns out. I have improved in every single test apart from one (\"Monkey Ladder\", where I need to remember an ever-increasing sequence of coloured tiles in order), in which I score exactly the same. In \"Double Trouble\" – the pesky red/blue words – I have soared from 33 points to 51, putting me in the top 6% of the population for reasoning.</p><p>Overall, I'm now in the top 29% of the population for short-term memory and the top 13% for concentration. My planning skills have stayed more or less static. Although I'm happy that I'm now supposedly more intelligent than when I started, part of me remains sceptical. I was taking the end tests in a different context: at home, with a mug of strong coffee and no other distractions. And, arguably, it was the second time I was taking the tests, so I was therefore more familiar with them.</p><p>There's also the fact that I wanted to get better, so perhaps I tried harder, in much the same way that paying for a monthly gym membership is likely to make you feel more motivated to exercise. Still, there's a sense of achievement, nonetheless.</p><p>I might not be a genius yet, but I'm really good at identifying when the word red is written in blue ink. That's probably enough to be getting on with for now.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/neuroscience\">Neuroscience</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/psychology\">Psychology</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps\">Apps</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/elizabethday\">Elizabeth Day</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One is that it turned out to be illegal in Europe and the second was that it was not a good product to offer in the US for the same reasons.\"</p><p>Schmidt, who said he was \"literally in the room\" when the decision was made to kill the product, said it had been a judgment call taken on Google's own initiative.</p><p>\"Facial recognition, completely unmonitored, can be used for very bad things,\" he said. \"It can be used for stalking, for example. You know, it's just we don't want to be part of that as a company.
