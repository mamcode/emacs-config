(description nil "<i>Editor&#8217;s Note: <a href=\"http://www.pamelafox.org\">Pamela Fox</a> is Coursera’s Lead Student Team Engineer.  Here is her post about a useful new Coursera feature called &#8220;Deadline Calendar&#8221;!</i><br/><br/><p>
I know it&#8217;s a matter of much debate, but I personally love that Coursera 
classes actually impose schedules and deadlines on students. 
I have a lot of things I want to get done in life, and if I don&#8217;t have a deadline for them, 
I don&#8217;t accomplish 99% of them. There&#8217;s always something else that needs to be done first, you know?
</p>

<p>
But I hate the feeling of missing a deadline in a class, especially if I&#8217;ve been meeting all the deadlines 
for a few weeks and been feeling good about my steak of good-student-ness. It&#8217;s that sudden, sinking feeling of 
&#8220;Awww, man, why didn&#8217;t I remember that an hour ago?&#8221; that can throw off your motivation for the rest of the class. 
</p>

<p>
So we have been working on ways to make it easier for all of us to remember our deadlines, 
because we think there should be less sinking feelings in the world. <br/><br/>Over the last week, 
we&#8217;ve started enabling a new feature in our classes: Deadlines Calendar. <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/351b03b68c87dfcaff6a2a8201095f90/tumblr_inline_ml288q9wft1qz4rgp.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"image\"/><br/>We&#8217;re outputting 
the deadlines for all the currently opened quizzes, assignments, homeworks, exams, and assessments, 
in the ICS or &#8220;iCal&#8221; format. This is a standard format that&#8217;s supported by many calendaring applications, 
notably the two most popular: Google Calendar and iCal, so that you can visualize the deadlines alongside 
your other very important life events.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here is how it works</b>: <br/><br/>
1. If the calendar is available for your class, you&#8217;ll see it on the sidebar underneath the upcoming 
deadlines on the main page:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/28a6a80fec1599257d33fba61faacad4/tumblr_inline_ml27rugUeP1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>

<p>
2. When you click that link, you&#8217;ll be brought to a page with instructions on how to use the iCal
file in Google Calendar and iCal.
</p>

<p>
3. Once I followed those instructions, here&#8217;s what my calendar looked like with Dan Ariely&#8217;s 
class added (and yes, I&#8217;m happy to report that I already finished this week&#8217;s quizzes!): <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/49676c21262457becb56e7e444702503/tumblr_inline_ml27fpsaL31qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>

<p>
4. I also followed the last step to set notifications on that calendar so that I&#8217;ll automatically get an email a day before: <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/53aadcc7dbb25e6ec0832adee883cef0/tumblr_inline_ml27g4mgzt1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>
<p>
Please try it out and let us know what you think. Hopefully it helps you plan and prioritize your life better, 
so that you can be a (bum ba BUM BUM) super student!

Greetings fellow Courserians!
<br/><br/>
Like you, I am enjoying the thrill of learning new things from some of the world&#8217;s best professors for
free. But, unlike you, I may be taking more courses than would generally be considered healthy.
<br/><br/>
You see, I decided earlier this year to try my own experiment within the greater MOOC experiment and
find out if it&#8217;s possible to learn as much as I&#8217;d get out of a four year liberal arts degree in just twelve
months using entirely free learning tools like Coursera.
<br/><br/>
At my <a href=\"http://degreeoffreedom.org/\">Degree of Freedom</a> web site, I&#8217;ve been writing about the experience in order to help students,
teachers, educational technology providers, and policy makers understand what works and what still
needs work in different areas of massive online learning.
<br/><br/>
But while my site is communicating with many audiences, the kind folks at Coursera thought it would be
valuable to share insights with fellow students regarding how to get the most out of their own MOOC
experiences. Which is why I&#8217;ll be visiting the Coursera blog semi-regularly to offer suggestions on how to
maximize success (which really translates to maximizing learning) based on what I discover as I continue
to cram four years of college into a single year.
<br/><br/>
Here&#8217;s a video to give you an idea of what I look like…
<br/><br/><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/z2znYceI0Ys\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>

<br/><br/>
As you can see, I&#8217;m old enough to have gone to a traditional brick-and-mortar college (during a decade
when we still used typewriters – albeit electric ones). Which has helped me identity a key theme for
success in online learning that will inform most of the things I&#8217;ll be sharing with you over the coming
months.
<br/><br/>
It&#8217;s kind of a cliché to say that you get as much out of college as you put into it, but this seemingly
trite observation becomes critical in an online world where classroom attendance and attentiveness,
dedication to keeping up with reading, and a commitment to doing your best on homework, tests,
papers and other types of assignments are all in your hands.
<br/><br/>
I&#8217;ll be talking about what this translates to over the coming months, but in the meantime you should be
thinking about not just what Coursera can do for you, but what you can do to maximize your own self-
motivated learning experience.</p>") (link nil "http://blog.coursera.org/post/46610254827") (guid nil "http://blog.coursera.org/post/46610254827") (pubDate nil "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 14:33:29 -0400") (dc:creator nil "helloyinner")) (item nil (title nil "An Easier Way to Find Yourselves in the Forums") (description nil "<b><i>Editor’s Note: Coursera’s Lead Student Team Engineer <a href=\"http://www.pamelafox.org\">Pamela Fox</a> shares with us a useful new Coursera feature: Forum Activity Profiles!<br/><br/></i></b><p>
I have to admit something embarrassing that all of our active forum participants know: before this week, the only way to find your posts or the posts of classmates in the forums was to search by name (or to keep a long list of browser bookmarks). 
</p>
<p>
We know that you are all really keen to keep up to date with the threads you&#8217;re participating in, and to find interesting posts by your classmates, so we&#8217;ve rolled out new functionality this week to make that all easier for you.
</p>

<h3>Forum Activity Profiles</h3>

<p>
For every student that participates in the forums, we&#8217;ve created a forum profile with their name, link to Coursera profile (if they&#8217;ve made one), and a list of their most recent threads, posts, and comments. There&#8217;s also an option to browse back further, for those prolific posters.
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the forum profile looks like for Joe Warren, a professor from our Interactive Python course that loves to answer questions and give students more challenges:
<br/><br/><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/~_6z_6c6tmyl.png\" alt=\"screenshot of Joe's forum profile\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc\"/></p>

<h3>Your Own Activity</h3>

<p>
We&#8217;ve added a quick link for your own profile to the forums. Just visit the main page of the forums and click &#8220;View your own activity&#8221;:
<br/><br/><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/2bit~ni6oz5u.png\" alt=\"screenshot of link to your own profile\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc\"/></p>

my first project was to redesign our front page in anticipation of our upcoming growth
from 4 to 17 universities. So many! How would we showcase them all?! But hey, I figured it out and we moved on.
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;ve grown quite a bit since then and we&#8217;re now up to 62 universities and  320+ courses, plus we&#8217;ve added the options for
Signature Track and ACE, all the while managing never to upgrade our poor year-old front page.
By the time we realized it was high time for renovation, it was quite the &#8220;fixer-upper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With the combined efforts of our designer Payam, our prolific intern Marc, and our newest
full-time web engineer Josh, we crafted a new front page and browsing experience.
Our new <a href=\"http://www.coursera.org/welcome\">front page</a> includes:
<br/><br/>• A prominent
search box, which takes potential students directly to our new course catalog.
<br/>• A showcase of beautiful imagery from our universities (seriously, have you seen <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/ep\">École Polytechnique</a>? I know where I&#8217;m traveling for next vacation). 
<br/>• A highlight of the courses that are starting soon as well as recently added courses.
</p>
<p>
We hope that we can help students find what they&#8217;re looking for faster, because 
that means more students to learn alongside all of you. ☺

The Learning Cafe (TLC) is an evening hours community ‘learning environment’ housed
in our public high school located in a high poverty community. The purpose of our
program is to raise community engagement in education by providing fresh enrichment
and advancement learning opportunities.We do what many community schools do: offer
a dinner, transportation, access to social services and childcare along with a wide range
of classes. We want to entice reluctant learners back to school while we challenge our
seasoned students with new learning choices as well.
<br/><br/>
My husband brought MOOC’s and Coursera to my attention last fall. We host TED
Talk discussion groups at TLC and so I watched Daphne Koller’s talk on Coursera.
This seemed a perfect option to offer. It was free. It honored and enticed our people by
providing instruction from some of the best in our country. It offered not only knowledge
but the potential to lead to additional learning or employment pursuits.
<br/><br/>
We marketed the opportunity for 3 months by word of mouth, online newsletters and
general announcements throughout the community. I wanted to deliberately reach out to
adults who did not have a college background and to high school students. I personally
approached several folks and asked them to take the risk with me. We had 14 show up
to our informational meeting and ended up with 10 who enrolled in the business class
they selected. Their ages ranged from 16 to 70+ and all but two had no college degree.
I hired a facilitator to assist. Of the 10 who initially enrolled, nine completed the class,
8 took the exam and 6 passed the exam! Most of them are on low or fixed income - not
the typical successful MOOC student. But they are eager, enthusiastic learners and
their pride in doing this was inspiring! I was so excited to hear about what this meant to
them!
<br/><br/>
Working as a cohort matters. Everyone talked about the importance of a peer group and
the facilitator in helping them complete the course. We provided access to a computer
lab several hours a week and worked hard to regularly encourage and follow up with
our students. They have greater confidence now as learners. I will never forget their
courage and joy when they finished and we celebrated together!<br/><br/>&#8212;<i>Sharon Watkins</i><br/><br/><i>If you&#8217;re interested in taking a business course like The Learning Cafe group did, please click below!

Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke, Dan Ariely is no ordinary man. With 70% of his body burned in an explosion when he was a teenager, a day in the life of Dan is plagued with aching limbs and hands that don’t always work, much less fit into ski gloves. But that doesn’t stop him from conquering the field of behavioral economics as the expert on all things “irrational.” One of the main themes in Dan’s research is the contrast between what a rational agent should do, at least according to standard economic theory, and how we humans actually behave. In his upcoming course on Coursera, “A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior,” Dan will provide an introduction to behavioral economics that makes you scratch your head and wonder why we act in the curious ways we do. How stable and consistent are our preferences? How do we think about money? How do we justify unethical behavior? What motivates us to work? How can we exhibit self-control in our lives? And what effect can emotion have on our behavior?
<br/><br/>
Back home in Durham, North Carolina, Dan is taking advantage of his experience with Coursera in a different way. At Duke, he is currently teaching an interdisciplinary undergraduate class that culminates in the production of MOOC-like material from the students themselves (<a href=\"http://today.duke.edu/2013/02/davidsonariely\" target=\"_blank\">which you can read about here</a>), and will experiment with the flipped classroom approach with his next batch of MBA students using the videos he created for Coursera to generate discussion in the classroom. 

<br/><br/>
If you’re interested, you can check out Dan’s book bundle.  The bundle isn&#8217;t required for the course but provides an interesting perspective on irrational behavior.  They are available here: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Irrational-Bundle-Irrationality-ebook/dp/B00BHEJ4IW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363210779&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=irrational+bundle&amp;tag=coursera-course123-20\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-irrational-bundle-dan-ariely/1114763210?ean=9780062288745\" target=\"_blank\">Nook</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-irrational-bundle/id606715318?mt=11\" target=\"_blank\">iBookstore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/The-Irrational-Bundle/book-EhitrXpidUq3OFuPXr1jQw/page1.html?s=dSd0sPFawEuz-tMJmjSZjQ&amp;r=1\" target=\"_blank\">Kobo</a>, or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Dan_Ariely_Dan_Ariely_s_Irrational_Bundle?id=ogcCO9qMTCAC\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>.

<p><span>A: I have taken a circuitous academic path to where I am today at Stanford. As an undergraduate I focused on physics and mathematics, with a few forays into English literature. I then went to the University of California at Berkeley to pursue a Ph.D. in physics. Along the way, however, I discovered that I was most interested in the history and philosophy of science, so I ended up with an M.A. in physics and a Ph.D. in history. I then made another detour and taught computer science for a number of years, first at Berkeley and then at the University of California at Davis. Coming to Stanford four years ago as an Academic Director has allowed me to return to some of my interests in the history of science. The energy and vibrancy of a place like Stanford is incredible, for all the obvious reasons, but especially because of its emphasis on the importance of a liberal education that crosses disciplinary boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What attracted you to the history of science? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: Besides the opportunity to retrace the paths of great thinkers like Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, I am particularly fascinated by the period of physics from the second half of the nineteenth century into the early twentieth century, because it’s a time of grand unifying theories (thermodynamics and electromagnetism), startling discoveries (X rays, radioactivity, and the electron), the rise of physics-based industries (the telegraph, electric lighting and power, and radio), and the transition from classical to modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics). </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What course are you teaching?</strong> </em></p>
<p><span>A: I am teaching “Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity.” </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Why should students be interested in this course? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: Nearly everyone has heard of Einstein—he is the most recognizable scientist of all time, he was chosen as “Person of the Century” by Time magazine and, if nothing else, his quotations seem to be all over the Internet (some of which are not actually by him, but that’s another story). They also may have heard that he came up with some of his revolutionary ideas, such as the special theory of relativity, while working as a lowly patent clerk. And they vaguely know that there’s some esoteric and mind-bending stuff involved. But they may not realize that the real story of his early troubles and triumphs is more interesting (and relevant) than the myths, and that it is well within their abilities to bend their minds a little and actually understand the basic concepts and implications of relativity. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Will students need to do a lot of math in the course? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: The good news is that the level of math required to gain a deeper understanding of the special theory of relativity is basic algebra. The even better news is that students will have a choice as to how much math they want to do. I have designed the course so that students can choose to follow a more quantitative approach or a more qualitative approach to the material. Those who choose the more quantitative approach will be doing some math (at the level of algebra), while those who choose the more qualitative approach will have to do little or no math in their assignments (though they need to be willing to try to follow along with the math in some of the video clips). Instead, one of the main assignments for the qualitative approach will be the completion of a creative project. In addition, a brief math review will be provided for those whose algebra skills are rusty. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Can you tell us more about the creative project?</strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: I hope that the opportunity to do a creative project on the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity will allow students to engage with the material in a way that’s different from what is usually done. The project might consist of a video, musical piece, work of art, poem, or animation, and the approach may be instructional, humorous, serious, or dramatic, or some combination thereof. So although I will have a few general guidelines within which students must work, there will be a lot of room for creativity.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><i><b>Q: What is the one thing that you hope students will take away from your course?</b></i> </span></p>
<p><span>A: Einstein talked about how the quest for understanding is an enriching and even an ennobling experience, and I hope that students will find the course to be exactly that kind of experience for them.</span></p>

<br/><br/>
Dear Walter and Ram,
<br/><br/>
I am writing on behalf of a study group for your Think Again course in Mashad, Iran. You guys probably get this kind of reaction a lot, but I can barely begin to communicate all the excitement your course caused among us. Not only did it inspire us to study the material you provided on Coursera, but we also got hold of a copy of Walter&#8217;s book (Understanding Arguments) and read the corresponding chapters every week. So, in the spirit of thanking you for all the time and effort you put into preparing the material, we decided to email you guys to thank you personally. Also, apparently, you are planning to offer the course again shortly, but we were wondering if any of you were planning to offer any new courses with a similar theme?
<br/><br/>
We learned a lot, and hope we can put it to some good use in our lives, and we are forever grateful.
<br/><br/>
Best,<br/>
Dan.

When most people think of Coursera, they think about the video lectures, 
the quizzes,and the peer-graded assignments. But there is another part which we 
think is equally important: the discussion forums. That&#8217;s where students debate 
what they&#8217;ve learnt in class, where instructors see what creative things their 
students have done on the side, where community TAs help guide students through 
problems, and where students give feedback about improving the platform and course. 
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;ve been collecting feedback from students and instructors about the forums, 
and finally found the time to start addressing that feedback. To start with, we 
realized that we want to be able to iterate quickly on our forums in the future, 
so we&#8217;ve re-written the forum codebase to use a more modern architecture and 
web technologies (it&#8217;s now a Backbone single-page web app, for the techies out there). 
Along with that re-writing, we&#8217;ve addressed some of the top usability concerns. 
Here&#8217;s a run-down of the changes you might notice:
</p>
<ul><li>When you post, comment or vote, the page will not reload and you will
 not lose your place by going to the top of the page.</li>
 <li>You will be able to undo votes and vote in the opposite direction.</li>
 <li>You will be able to link to specific posts or comments, not just the whole thread.
 If you click the timestamp on a post or comment, your window URL will change to
  the permalink for that post and you can share that URL.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/pqhrx-gnd3_1.png\">See screenshot.</a>
  </li>
  <li>Forum notification emails will link to specific posts/comments, not 
  just the whole thread, and the comment being linked to will be highlighted.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/w1qyz20-0-7p.png\">See screenshot.</a>
  </li>
  <li>The threads are no longer paginated, but instead use &#8220;infinite loading&#8221;, so that you can scroll
  up or down to load earlier/later posts in the thread.
  </li>
  <li>The original poster will now be able to edit the title of his/her thread without deleting it.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/uk6yiwbtukur.png\">See screenshot.</a></li>
  <li>The post labels (pinned, approved, etc) now use a yellow/red color scheme.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/gh8nw4vzq4-r.png\">See screenshot.</a>
  </li>
  <li>Forum posts are now composed using a Wysiwyg editor instead of the Markdown editor,
  so the preview is the same as when you’re typing it. The wysiwig editor includes options for inserting
  links, code, images, and MathJax.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/2zok6983aov1.png\">See screenshot.</a>
  </li>
  <li>When creating a new thread, you can change the subforum it will be posted in.
  <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/7~6m93~952c3.png\">See screenshot.</a>
  </li>
  <li>We added a way for students to see their own forum activity as well as see other students&#8217; (non-anonymous) activities. To view the forum activity for another student, you can click on their name in bylines in the forum. To view your own activity, click &#8220;View your latest activity&#8221; from main forum page. (<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/b8_q6mg5b8dp.png\">See screenshot.</a>) </li>
</ul><p>
We will start to roll out the new forums to classes this week, so you should all 
see it quite soon. We look forward to continuing to iterate on the forums, like 
giving you ways to follow eachother&#8217;s posts, better subscription options, 
a better dashboard of the posts you care about, and forums embedded in other parts 
of the class experience.  
</p>
<p>
We love seeing what all of you post in the forums. Thank you for all of your feedback in making forum functionalities more connected and dynamic.

<p><span>I took the Coursera course, &#8220;Modern and Contemporary American Poetry&#8221;, taught by Al Filreis of the University of Pennsylvania. I chose it because as a physics major in college I didn&#8217;t have time to take a poetry course. When I saw that we would be reading William Carlos Williams, one of my favorite poets, I signed up. I didn&#8217;t learn about Coursera until the course had already started so I began the third week in and tried to catch up. I never did; I am now signed up to take it again in September. I am very happy that I can do that. And they are adding Wallace Stevens!</span></p>
<p><span>It was wonderful to be able to take a class on poetry taught by a fabulous teacher and a great group of TA&#8217;s. </span><span>I was impressed by how Professor Filreis used a variety of instructional strategies and technology to create a community of learners.</span></p>
<p><span>The TA&#8217;s were great and they provided an in-house classroom that we could all watch and be a part of. We learned from watching and listening to them how to read poems closely and talk about them. The class included weekly live webcasts, online readings of the poems, quizzes and writing assignments. Participants joined online forums and in some parts of the world met in person. In the last live webcast several students talked about how the course was transformative. </span></p>
<p><span>In my experience one is lucky to have a teacher who is passionate about what s/he studies and wants to share it with you. Al Filreis does that with modern poetry.

"<i>Editor’s Note: <a href=\"http://www.pamelafox.org\">Pamela Fox</a> is Coursera’s Lead Student Team Engineer.  Here is her post about a useful new Coursera feature called “Deadline Calendar”!</i><br/><br/><p>
I know it’s a matter of much debate, but I personally love that Coursera
classes actually impose schedules and deadlines on students.
I have a lot of things I want to get done in life, and if I don’t have a deadline for them,
I don’t accomplish 99% of them. There’s always something else that needs to be done first, you know?
</p>
<p>
But I hate the feeling of missing a deadline in a class, especially if I’ve been meeting all the deadlines
for a few weeks and been feeling good about my steak of good-student-ness. It’s that sudden, sinking feeling of
“Awww, man, why didn’t I remember that an hour ago?” that can throw off your motivation for the rest of the class.
</p>
<p>
So we have been working on ways to make it easier for all of us to remember our deadlines,
because we think there should be less sinking feelings in the world. <br/><br/>Over the last week,
we’ve started enabling a new feature in our classes: Deadlines Calendar. <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/351b03b68c87dfcaff6a2a8201095f90/tumblr_inline_ml288q9wft1qz4rgp.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"image\"/><br/>We’re outputting
the deadlines for all the currently opened quizzes, assignments, homeworks, exams, and assessments,
in the ICS or “iCal” format. This is a standard format that’s supported by many calendaring applications,
notably the two most popular: Google Calendar and iCal, so that you can visualize the deadlines alongside
your other very important life events.
</p>
<p>
<b>Here is how it works</b>: <br/><br/>
1. If the calendar is available for your class, you’ll see it on the sidebar underneath the upcoming
deadlines on the main page:<br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/28a6a80fec1599257d33fba61faacad4/tumblr_inline_ml27rugUeP1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>
<p>
2. When you click that link, you’ll be brought to a page with instructions on how to use the iCal
file in Google Calendar and iCal.
</p>
<p>
3. Once I followed those instructions, here’s what my calendar looked like with Dan Ariely’s
class added (and yes, I’m happy to report that I already finished this week’s quizzes!): <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/49676c21262457becb56e7e444702503/tumblr_inline_ml27fpsaL31qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>
<p>
4. I also followed the last step to set notifications on that calendar so that I’ll automatically get an email a day before: <br/><br/><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/53aadcc7dbb25e6ec0832adee883cef0/tumblr_inline_ml27g4mgzt1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/></p>
<p>
Please try it out and let us know what you think. Hopefully it helps you plan and prioritize your life better,
so that you can be a (bum ba BUM BUM) super student!

Greetings fellow Courserians!
<br/><br/>
Like you, I am enjoying the thrill of learning new things from some of the world’s best professors for
free. But, unlike you, I may be taking more courses than would generally be considered healthy.
<br/><br/>
You see, I decided earlier this year to try my own experiment within the greater MOOC experiment and
find out if it’s possible to learn as much as I’d get out of a four year liberal arts degree in just twelve
months using entirely free learning tools like Coursera.
<br/><br/>
At my <a href=\"http://degreeoffreedom.org/\">Degree of Freedom</a> web site, I’ve been writing about the experience in order to help students,
teachers, educational technology providers, and policy makers understand what works and what still
needs work in different areas of massive online learning.
<br/><br/>
But while my site is communicating with many audiences, the kind folks at Coursera thought it would be
valuable to share insights with fellow students regarding how to get the most out of their own MOOC
experiences. Which is why I’ll be visiting the Coursera blog semi-regularly to offer suggestions on how to
maximize success (which really translates to maximizing learning) based on what I discover as I continue
to cram four years of college into a single year.
<br/><br/>
Here’s a video to give you an idea of what I look like…
<br/><br/><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/z2znYceI0Ys\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>
<br/><br/>
As you can see, I’m old enough to have gone to a traditional brick-and-mortar college (during a decade
when we still used typewriters – albeit electric ones). Which has helped me identity a key theme for
success in online learning that will inform most of the things I’ll be sharing with you over the coming
months.
<br/><br/>
It’s kind of a cliché to say that you get as much out of college as you put into it, but this seemingly
trite observation becomes critical in an online world where classroom attendance and attentiveness,
dedication to keeping up with reading, and a commitment to doing your best on homework, tests,
papers and other types of assignments are all in your hands.
<br/><br/>
I’ll be talking about what this translates to over the coming months, but in the meantime you should be
thinking about not just what Coursera can do for you, but what you can do to maximize your own self-
motivated learning experience.</p>" "http://blog.coursera.org/post/46610254827" (20821 56953) old 6 nil nil ((title nil "The 1 Year MOOC BA Experiment: Degree of Freedom") (description nil "<p><i><b>Editor&#8217;s note: Jonathan Haber is a Courserian who is taking classes for 12 months on Coursera to experiment with a project of his called &#8220;Degree of Freedom&#8221;.

We’ve grown quite a bit since then and we’re now up to 62 universities and  320+ courses, plus we’ve added the options for

With the combined efforts of our designer Payam, our prolific intern Marc, and our newest

Our new <a href=\"http://www.coursera.org/welcome\">front page</a> includes:
<br/><br/>• A prominent

<br/>• A showcase of beautiful imagery from our universities (seriously, have you seen <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/ep\">École Polytechnique</a>? I know where I’m traveling for next vacation).

The Learning Cafe (TLC) is an evening hours community ‘learning environment’ housed
in our public high school located in a high poverty community. The purpose of our
program is to raise community engagement in education by providing fresh enrichment
and advancement learning opportunities.We do what many community schools do: offer
a dinner, transportation, access to social services and childcare along with a wide range
of classes. We want to entice reluctant learners back to school while we challenge our
seasoned students with new learning choices as well.
<br/><br/>
My husband brought MOOC’s and Coursera to my attention last fall. We host TED
Talk discussion groups at TLC and so I watched Daphne Koller’s talk on Coursera.
This seemed a perfect option to offer. It was free. It honored and enticed our people by
providing instruction from some of the best in our country. It offered not only knowledge
but the potential to lead to additional learning or employment pursuits.
<br/><br/>
We marketed the opportunity for 3 months by word of mouth, online newsletters and
general announcements throughout the community. I wanted to deliberately reach out to
adults who did not have a college background and to high school students. I personally
approached several folks and asked them to take the risk with me. We had 14 show up
to our informational meeting and ended up with 10 who enrolled in the business class
they selected. Their ages ranged from 16 to 70+ and all but two had no college degree.
I hired a facilitator to assist. Of the 10 who initially enrolled, nine completed the class,
8 took the exam and 6 passed the exam! Most of them are on low or fixed income - not
the typical successful MOOC student. But they are eager, enthusiastic learners and
their pride in doing this was inspiring! I was so excited to hear about what this meant to
them!
<br/><br/>
Working as a cohort matters. Everyone talked about the importance of a peer group and
the facilitator in helping them complete the course. We provided access to a computer
lab several hours a week and worked hard to regularly encourage and follow up with
our students. They have greater confidence now as learners. I will never forget their
courage and joy when they finished and we celebrated together!<br/><br/>—<i>Sharon Watkins</i><br/><br/><i>If you’re interested in taking a business course like The Learning Cafe group did, please click below!

"<p><center><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/dacc1a27f13823c9d1e52436361859f3/tumblr_inline_mjvb657xFs1qz4rgp.png\" alt=\"image\"/><br/></center>
Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke, Dan Ariely is no ordinary man. With 70% of his body burned in an explosion when he was a teenager, a day in the life of Dan is plagued with aching limbs and hands that don’t always work, much less fit into ski gloves. But that doesn’t stop him from conquering the field of behavioral economics as the expert on all things “irrational.” One of the main themes in Dan’s research is the contrast between what a rational agent should do, at least according to standard economic theory, and how we humans actually behave. In his upcoming course on Coursera, “A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior,” Dan will provide an introduction to behavioral economics that makes you scratch your head and wonder why we act in the curious ways we do. How stable and consistent are our preferences? How do we think about money? How do we justify unethical behavior? What motivates us to work? How can we exhibit self-control in our lives? And what effect can emotion have on our behavior?
<br/><br/>
Back home in Durham, North Carolina, Dan is taking advantage of his experience with Coursera in a different way. At Duke, he is currently teaching an interdisciplinary undergraduate class that culminates in the production of MOOC-like material from the students themselves (<a href=\"http://today.duke.edu/2013/02/davidsonariely\" target=\"_blank\">which you can read about here</a>), and will experiment with the flipped classroom approach with his next batch of MBA students using the videos he created for Coursera to generate discussion in the classroom.
<br/><br/>
If you’re interested, you can check out Dan’s book bundle.  The bundle isn’t required for the course but provides an interesting perspective on irrational behavior.

Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke, Dan Ariely is no ordinary man. With 70% of his body burned in an explosion when he was a teenager, a day in the life of Dan is plagued with aching limbs and hands that don’t always work, much less fit into ski gloves. But that doesn’t stop him from conquering the field of behavioral economics as the expert on all things “irrational.” One of the main themes in Dan’s research is the contrast between what a rational agent should do, at least according to standard economic theory, and how we humans actually behave. In his upcoming course on Coursera, “A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior,” Dan will provide an introduction to behavioral economics that makes you scratch your head and wonder why we act in the curious ways we do. How stable and consistent are our preferences? How do we think about money? How do we justify unethical behavior? What motivates us to work? How can we exhibit self-control in our lives? And what effect can emotion have on our behavior?
<br/><br/>
Back home in Durham, North Carolina, Dan is taking advantage of his experience with Coursera in a different way. At Duke, he is currently teaching an interdisciplinary undergraduate class that culminates in the production of MOOC-like material from the students themselves (<a href=\"http://today.duke.edu/2013/02/davidsonariely\" target=\"_blank\">which you can read about here</a>), and will experiment with the flipped classroom approach with his next batch of MBA students using the videos he created for Coursera to generate discussion in the classroom. 

<br/><br/>
If you’re interested, you can check out Dan’s book bundle.  The bundle isn&#8217;t required for the course but provides an interesting perspective on irrational behavior.

<p><span>A: I have taken a circuitous academic path to where I am today at Stanford. As an undergraduate I focused on physics and mathematics, with a few forays into English literature. I then went to the University of California at Berkeley to pursue a Ph.D. in physics. Along the way, however, I discovered that I was most interested in the history and philosophy of science, so I ended up with an M.A. in physics and a Ph.D. in history. I then made another detour and taught computer science for a number of years, first at Berkeley and then at the University of California at Davis. Coming to Stanford four years ago as an Academic Director has allowed me to return to some of my interests in the history of science. The energy and vibrancy of a place like Stanford is incredible, for all the obvious reasons, but especially because of its emphasis on the importance of a liberal education that crosses disciplinary boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What attracted you to the history of science? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: Besides the opportunity to retrace the paths of great thinkers like Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, I am particularly fascinated by the period of physics from the second half of the nineteenth century into the early twentieth century, because it’s a time of grand unifying theories (thermodynamics and electromagnetism), startling discoveries (X rays, radioactivity, and the electron), the rise of physics-based industries (the telegraph, electric lighting and power, and radio), and the transition from classical to modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics). </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: What course are you teaching?</strong> </em></p>
<p><span>A: I am teaching “Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity.” </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Why should students be interested in this course? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: Nearly everyone has heard of Einstein—he is the most recognizable scientist of all time, he was chosen as “Person of the Century” by Time magazine and, if nothing else, his quotations seem to be all over the Internet (some of which are not actually by him, but that’s another story). They also may have heard that he came up with some of his revolutionary ideas, such as the special theory of relativity, while working as a lowly patent clerk. And they vaguely know that there’s some esoteric and mind-bending stuff involved. But they may not realize that the real story of his early troubles and triumphs is more interesting (and relevant) than the myths, and that it is well within their abilities to bend their minds a little and actually understand the basic concepts and implications of relativity. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Will students need to do a lot of math in the course? </strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: The good news is that the level of math required to gain a deeper understanding of the special theory of relativity is basic algebra. The even better news is that students will have a choice as to how much math they want to do. I have designed the course so that students can choose to follow a more quantitative approach or a more qualitative approach to the material. Those who choose the more quantitative approach will be doing some math (at the level of algebra), while those who choose the more qualitative approach will have to do little or no math in their assignments (though they need to be willing to try to follow along with the math in some of the video clips). Instead, one of the main assignments for the qualitative approach will be the completion of a creative project. In addition, a brief math review will be provided for those whose algebra skills are rusty. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Can you tell us more about the creative project?</strong></em></p>
<p><span>A: I hope that the opportunity to do a creative project on the young Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity will allow students to engage with the material in a way that’s different from what is usually done. The project might consist of a video, musical piece, work of art, poem, or animation, and the approach may be instructional, humorous, serious, or dramatic, or some combination thereof. So although I will have a few general guidelines within which students must work, there will be a lot of room for creativity.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><i><b>Q: What is the one thing that you hope students will take away from your course?</b></i> </span></p>
<p><span>A: Einstein talked about how the quest for understanding is an enriching and even an ennobling experience, and I hope that students will find the course to be exactly that kind of experience for them.</span></p>

Dear Walter and Ram,
<br/><br/>
I am writing on behalf of a study group for your Think Again course in Mashad, Iran. You guys probably get this kind of reaction a lot, but I can barely begin to communicate all the excitement your course caused among us. Not only did it inspire us to study the material you provided on Coursera, but we also got hold of a copy of Walter’s book (Understanding Arguments) and read the corresponding chapters every week. So, in the spirit of thanking you for all the time and effort you put into preparing the material, we decided to email you guys to thank you personally. Also, apparently, you are planning to offer the course again shortly, but we were wondering if any of you were planning to offer any new courses with a similar theme?
<br/><br/>
We learned a lot, and hope we can put it to some good use in our lives, and we are forever grateful.
<br/><br/>
Best,<br/>
Dan.

When most people think of Coursera, they think about the video lectures,
the quizzes,and the peer-graded assignments. But there is another part which we
think is equally important: the discussion forums. That’s where students debate
what they’ve learnt in class, where instructors see what creative things their
students have done on the side, where community TAs help guide students through
problems, and where students give feedback about improving the platform and course.
</p>
<p>
We’ve been collecting feedback from students and instructors about the forums,
and finally found the time to start addressing that feedback. To start with, we
realized that we want to be able to iterate quickly on our forums in the future,
so we’ve re-written the forum codebase to use a more modern architecture and
web technologies (it’s now a Backbone single-page web app, for the techies out there).
Along with that re-writing, we’ve addressed some of the top usability concerns.
Here’s a run-down of the changes you might notice:
</p>
<ul><li>When you post, comment or vote, the page will not reload and you will
not lose your place by going to the top of the page.</li>
<li>You will be able to undo votes and vote in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>You will be able to link to specific posts or comments, not just the whole thread.
If you click the timestamp on a post or comment, your window URL will change to
the permalink for that post and you can share that URL.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/pqhrx-gnd3_1.png\">See screenshot.</a>
</li>
<li>Forum notification emails will link to specific posts/comments, not
just the whole thread, and the comment being linked to will be highlighted.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/w1qyz20-0-7p.png\">See screenshot.</a>
</li>
<li>The threads are no longer paginated, but instead use “infinite loading”, so that you can scroll
up or down to load earlier/later posts in the thread.
</li>
<li>The original poster will now be able to edit the title of his/her thread without deleting it.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/uk6yiwbtukur.png\">See screenshot.</a></li>
<li>The post labels (pinned, approved, etc) now use a yellow/red color scheme.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/gh8nw4vzq4-r.png\">See screenshot.</a>
</li>
<li>Forum posts are now composed using a Wysiwyg editor instead of the Markdown editor,
so the preview is the same as when you’re typing it. The wysiwig editor includes options for inserting
links, code, images, and MathJax.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/2zok6983aov1.png\">See screenshot.</a>
</li>
<li>When creating a new thread, you can change the subforum it will be posted in.
<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/7~6m93~952c3.png\">See screenshot.</a>
</li>
<li>We added a way for students to see their own forum activity as well as see other students’ (non-anonymous) activities. To view the forum activity for another student, you can click on their name in bylines in the forum. To view your own activity, click “View your latest activity” from main forum page. (<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10998095/Screenshots/b8_q6mg5b8dp.png\">See screenshot.</a>) </li>
</ul><p>
We will start to roll out the new forums to classes this week, so you should all
see it quite soon. We look forward to continuing to iterate on the forums, like
giving you ways to follow eachother’s posts, better subscription options,
a better dashboard of the posts you care about, and forums embedded in other parts
of the class experience.
</p>
<p>
We love seeing what all of you post in the forums. Thank you for all of your feedback in making forum functionalities more connected and dynamic.

<p><span>I took the Coursera course, “Modern and Contemporary American Poetry”, taught by Al Filreis of the University of Pennsylvania. I chose it because as a physics major in college I didn’t have time to take a poetry course. When I saw that we would be reading William Carlos Williams, one of my favorite poets, I signed up. I didn’t learn about Coursera until the course had already started so I began the third week in and tried to catch up. I never did; I am now signed up to take it again in September. I am very happy that I can do that. And they are adding Wallace Stevens!</span></p>
<p><span>It was wonderful to be able to take a class on poetry taught by a fabulous teacher and a great group of TA’s. </span><span>I was impressed by how Professor Filreis used a variety of instructional strategies and technology to create a community of learners.</span></p>
<p><span>The TA’s were great and they provided an in-house classroom that we could all watch and be a part of.

Participants joined online forums and in some parts of the world met in person. In the last live webcast several students talked about how the course was transformative. </span></p>
