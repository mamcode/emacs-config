But how common are they?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu\">Global Terrorism Database</a> has recorded terror attacks across the world - with data from 1970 covering up to the end of 2011. It's a huge dataset: over 104,000 attacks, including around 2,600 in the US - and its collection is funded by an agency of the US government: the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/st-centers-excellence\">Science and Technology Directorate</a> of the US Department of Homeland Security through a Center of Excellence program based at the University of Maryland.</p><p>There is a lot of detail in there - and it shows how there are actually fewer attacks now than in the 1970s. There were a total of 207 terrorist attacks in the US between 2001 and 2011. They went down from a high of 40 in 2001 to nine in 2011. The smallest number of attacks occurred in 2006 when the database recorded six. Between 2001 and 2011, it shows a total of 21 fatal terror attacks.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>But the other side of that is the more recent attacks have been incredibly deadly - with 9/11 obviously dominating the data. This great post from the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/16/eight-facts-about-terrorism-in-the-united-states/\">Washington Post</a> points this - and more - out. It's based on this report from the <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu/start/publications/START_IUSSDDataTerroristAttacksUS_1970-2011.pdf\">National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism</a>, reporting on last year's GTD figures. </p><p>The biggest caveat about these figures is that these are all attacks, not necessarily those that cause more loss of life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>This chart of total attacks shows how 9/11 distorts the total figures - comprising 85% of all the terror deaths recorded. Those other peaks? The 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the 1984 wounding peak was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Rajneeshee_bioterror_attack\">Rajneeshee bioterror attack</a> where restaurants were deliberately contaminated with salmonella. One caveat on the 9/11 figures is the number of wounded - which here is not from teh GTD. As they say:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />We report the number of wounded as unknown because of the wide discrepancy in reports on the World Trade Center attacks. Unlike total fatalities, no official totals have ever been given for injuries, and reports vary considerably. For example, some reports suggest that over 2,000 first responders alone were injured, while others suggest that total number of wounded is somewhere in the hundreds. The general consensus (though not \"our\" number) is that more than 2,000 people were injured in the attacks on World Trade Center towers 9/11. For further reference too <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9087/index1.html\">RAND</a> lists it as 2261, but even they note that it probably isn't terribly accurate.</p></blockquote><p>Very few parts of the US have managed to avoid attacks of one sort or another. We've mapped the database, using CartoDB. Click the image below to explore it.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The data also shows how the nature of those attacks have changed too. As the Post points out: \"Bombings have dropped in popularity over the last decade — accounting for just 27% of the attacks since 2001 … And, notably, guns have never figured heavily in US terrorist attacks\".</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/terrorism-in-us-real-threat-level\">Harry Enten writes</a>, the Boston attack is unusual for a number of reasons:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>About the only characteristic that perhaps doesn't fit the conventional pattern is that it occurred at a sports event, rather than the target being a government building or business. Indeed, the targeting of ordinary civilian members of the public is the truly scary part of the Boston Marathon bombing: with the exception of the Atlanta Olympics bombing of 1996, the idea of attacking a sports event in the United States is novel and unusual.</p></blockquote><p>The final point is a sense of perspective: bad as the number of US attacks are, there are far fewer there than in many countries around the world.</p><p>Here are the key findings from the report:</p><blockquote><p>• The highest proportion of unsuccessful attacks since 1970 occurred in 2011 - four out of nine recorded attacks were unsuccessful<br />• From 2001 to 2011 California (40) and New York (19) experienced the most total terrorist attacks against the US homeland<br />• The three cities in the United States that experienced the most attacks from 2001 to 2011 were New York City (12), Washington, DC (9) and Los Angeles (8)<br />• The most common weapons used in terrorist attacks in the United States from 2001 to 2011 were bombs (53% of all weapons used) and explosives (20% of all weapons used)<br />• For the period from 2001 to 2011, biological weapons were tied with firearms as the third most common weapon used in terrorist attacks (both represented 8% of all weapons used). This is due to the anthrax attacks in October 2001<br />• From 2001 to 2011, the most common targets of terrorists in the United States were businesses (62 attacks), private citizens and property (59 attacks), and government (43 attacks)<br />• The three terrorist organizations with the largest number of attacks on the US from 2001 to 2011 were the Earth Liberation Front (50), the Animal <br />Liberation Front (34) and al-Qa'ida (4)</p></blockquote><p>The data is <a href=\"#data\">below for you to download</a>.

This what that data shows.</p><p>Although 26,839 people had registered to race, in the end, some 23,336 actually set off - this is normal for huge events like this. </p><p>The biggest group of competitors were aged 18 to 39 - 9,801 people, over half of whom were men. 181 of the competitors have some sort of disability - that's more than the number of people who competed from France and nearly as many as came from Mexico. It testifies to incredible determination: 54 racers were in wheelchairs, 40 were 'visually impaired'. </p><p>Fifteen of the racers were aged over 80.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>It was a United Nations of marathon running. Of all those who started the race, 18,816 were citizens of the US - which means nearly a fifth were from other countries. The biggest group, 40%, were from Canada - 1,831, followed by the UK, which saw 320 start the race, or 6% of all the non-US competitors. They are followed by Japan (238), Germany (224), Italy (202) and Mexico (192).</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Looking at where racers came from, you can see how the North East of the US dominates the map - even when it takes account, as the map below does, of population.

Social media, both good and bad, has filled the information space <br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-explosions-hunt-begins-for-perperators-live-updates\">Live updates on Boston marathon explosions from Paul Owen</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-explosion-map-interactive\">Guardian interactive tool on the blasts</a></p><p>At around 2.50pm ET (7.50pm GMT) two explosions were detonated near the finish line of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston Marathon</a>. Since then, there has been a frantic attempt to collect and visualise information about events and the number of victims. Here, look at some of the tools used to gain clarity about what happened, assist those seeking help and those providing it.</p><h2>Information</h2><p><a href=\"http://live.boston.com/Event/Live_blog_Explosion_in_Copley_Square/72936164\">Boston.com</a> quickly set up two Google forms in response to the explosion: one '<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/forms/d/1r2dbf7q2sIiiQWynPNgH74qNeheNycTyk7hXue9AJhs/viewform\">need a place to stay</a>' and one '<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/forms/d/1dqIKVq6IqX4BVXqOW_a9-qmXt1KJ_4Nu3NPNnC1g1mw/viewform\">I have a place to offer</a>'. Users were also able to see the information already submitted by others, including phone numbers and e-mail addresses so that they could contact others directly.</p><p>Using <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/\">Tableau</a>, we've shown how the number of offers of accommodation has changed over time as the link to the spreadsheet was shared on social media, news and official websites. The graph shows how in the space of two minutes, the number of offers increased from 3 to 85 and stayed high over the next ten minutes. This peaked again around an hour later, when 33 offers to help those needing shelter were received via Google. </p><p>As has been the case in the aftermath of other crises (such as the Mumbai attacks in 2011), social media has played a central role. Boston's mayor's office quickly tweeted information about which areas to avoid and Boston's police department used its twitter account to request information from members of the public, announce street closures and press conferences.</p><p>In fact, not tweeting was a decision which had to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BostonFire\">publicly justified</a> by Boston's fire department.</p><p><a href=\"http://trendsmap.com/\">Trendsmap</a> tracks twitter trends in real time and maps them using the location in users' twitter profiles. As it's so soon after the event, several of these visualisations are still being developed, however as this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlL-foAGizk&feature=player_embeddedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlL-foAGizk&feature=player_embedded\">video after the Samoa earthquake demonstrates</a>, Trendsmap is also able to show how twitter trends evolve over time.</p><p>Because it can process tweets in all languages, Trendsmap can also show global twitter trends. These screengrabs (taken at 11am GMT) show that the Boston marathon explosion was not just the main topic of American twitter users, but also those in Western Europe, South Africa, Australia, East Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>Maps have also been important in order to understand the impact of the explosion at the micro-level. This interactive map developed by The Guardian shows where the devices were detonated and includes verified pictures taken after the blasts. </p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>Misinformation</h2><p>Inevitably, a small number of opportunists have sought to use the explosions to further their own agendas. A twitter account promising a $1 donation to victims for every retweet received more than 50,000 retweets and 800 favourites before being <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/04/15/fake-boston-marathon-twitter-account-appears-after-explosions-quickly-suspended/\">suspended</a> by Twitter. Another account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HopeForBoston?tw_i=323948385952473088&tw_p=tweetembed\">@HopeforBoston</a>, claims to have images of children killed in Boston's explosions who were running for victims of last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a>. Despite receiving more than 100,000 retweets, the images are fake and were taken from a <a href=\"http://www.saxonscope.com/top-stories/2012/05/20/hundreds-turn-out-for-3rd-annual-joe-cassella-5k/\">school run</a> in May last year.</p><h2>More open data</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">Data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p>• <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/GuardianData\">Follow us on Twitter</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mona-chalabi\">Mona Chalabi</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/john-burn-murdoch\">John Burn-Murdoch</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The ONS state that \"over the last six months, the CPI 12-month rate has been particularly stable, standing at 2.7% for four months followed by 2.8% for February and March 2013\". <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/katieallen\">Katie Allen</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/16/inflation-newspapers-books\">writes today</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The rate of inflation stayed at its highest level for almost a year in March, keeping up the squeeze on consumers.</p><p>The annual rate of consumer price inflation held at 2.8%, according to official data. That is the highest since last May and in line with economists' forecasts.</p></blockquote><p>There is more than one method of measuring inflation. Up until today, we were mostly concerned with the consumer price index (CPI) measure - which is the government's favoured one. In September 2011, when the CPI stood at 5.2%, it had never been higher in recorded history. The CPI is important because it is used for uprating pensions, wages and benefits.</p><p>The second measure is the retail price index (RPI) which has now been dumped as a national statistic (although the ONS will keep publishing it for a while).</p><p>Instead we now have CPIH, which includes owner occupiers' housing costs and RPIJ - the new version of the Retail Prices Index (RPI). If you're interested, the old RPI measure stands at 3.3% this month, up from 3.2% last month.</p><p>This is how the indexes compare:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We have also added in pay data - and you can see how inflation has been racing ahead of average earnings. Even with the falls in previous months, people's wages are not increasing as fast as the cost of living.</p><p>There are some important differences between the two ways the ONS measures inflation. The government prefers the <strong>consumer price index</strong>, which also includes services, housing, electricity, food, and transportation, but the <strong>retail price index</strong> covers more items. The RPI includes housing costs and is used for many pay negotiations and used to be used for pension payments.

Amnesty does not provide a precise figure of executions in China as Beijing keeps such figures secret.</p><p>China, together with Iran, North Korea, Yemen and the US (the only G7 country to still execute people) carried out the most executions last year. Excluding China, the report says:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>At least 1,722 people were sentenced to death in 58 countries in 2012. This is a decrease from 2011, when at least 1,923 people were known to have been sentenced in 63 countries worldwide, and a reduction for the second year running (2010: 2,024 death sentences in 67 countries). In 2012 Amnesty International recorded executions in 21 countries. It cannot be excluded that executions took place in Egypt and Syria, though none could be confirmed. This figure reflects the significant overall decline of the death penalty from a decade earlier, when 28 countries carried out executions in 2003. </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Latvia abolished the death penalty, meaning that there are nearly five times as many countries not executing prisoners as those that do in 2012.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Setting China aside, Amnesty said at least 680 executions were carried out last year - up by four on the previous year. Half of those took place in Iran (314). Iraq executed 129, Saudi Arabia 79 and the US 43. The minimum number of executions was down from at least 712 in 2009. </p><p>The Middle East saw 557 executions in six countries - the vast majority of the list. In Tunisia, 125 people on death row had their sentence commuted to life by the transitional government.</p><p>Methods of execution included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and various kinds of shooting (by firing squad, and at close range to the heart or the head). Public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. In Saudi Arabia, executions are usually beheadings with a sword. In one case recorded by Amnesty, a Sudanese man's head was sewn back onto his body and hung from a pole in a <br />public place.</p><p>Amnesty has given us the <a href=\"#data\">data</a>, right back to 2007.

But 120 of the roles – a figure almost unchanged since the coalition's first parliamentary session – have gone to consultants, lobbyists, or senior managers and executives in charities and businesses.<br />In opposition, David Cameron referred to lobbying as \"the next big scandal waiting to happen\" and the coalition agreement included pledges on lobbying reform, including a statutory register of lobbyists. But as progress in these areas has stalled, transparency advocates have raised concerns over the unchanges status quo in the Lords.<br />Current parliamentary passholders include lobbyists working with the casino industry, consultants to defence firms, senior trade union officials, and political consultants to overseas governments and their proxies, including Kurdistan and Azerbaijan.<br />Among those listed on the current version of the register, dated 11 March 2013, are Lord Black of Brentwood – an executive director of the Telegraph Media Group – who sponsors a pass for the Telegraph's head of public affairs, Edward Taylor, and Lord Howard of Rising, who declares a pass to Richard Ritchie, the director of UK government affairs for BP.

We've taken a look at the different funeral options available and the potential costs<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Get the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Whether it's £8m or £10m, the estimated costs of Margaret Thatcher's funeral that are being widely reported don't seem to be based on any clear sources. Not here at the Datablog. We take a look at the different types of funeral to bury Britain's <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">'exceptionally distinguished'</a> commoners and consider the costs that might be incurred.</p><h2><strong>Big British funerals</strong></h2><p>If the estimates that are being circulated <em>are</em> correct, the funeral of Margaret Thatcher will be the most expensive in British history. The funeral of Sir Winston Churchill required £2,000 to cover the expenses of fire, police and civil defence services (the equivalent of almost £33,000 in 2012). Though policing costs aren't known, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">Queen Mother's funeral cost the Ministry of Defence</a> around £301,000 in 2002. </p><p>As well as the large numbers of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/10/margaret-thatcher-funeral-armed-forces\">armed forces already being drawn in</a> to the ceremony, it's likely that given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/police-arrests-thatcher-death-parties\">anti-Thatcher protests</a> have already required riot police, considerable security enforcement will probably be needed. Some of the expense will be covered by the estate of Lady Thatcher, though the government is <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/information-on-arrangements-for-lady-thatchers-funeral/\">not forthcoming</a> on the proportion and the size of Thatcher's estate remains a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-estate-family-secret\">closely guarded secret</a>.</p><h2><strong>State and ceremonial funerals: what's the difference?</strong></h2><p>Procedurally, not much. In both cases, a military procession takes the deceased from their chapel of rest to Westminster Hall, where they lie in state for three days. After lying in state, the procession continues to either Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's Cathedral, where a funeral service is held.</p><p>Ceremonial funerals send off the deceased with a paltry 19-gun salute while state funerals are marked by a 21-gun salute. In a ceremonial funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by horses rather than Royal Navy ratings (specially trained personnel), as is the case for state funerals. Finally, state funerals require a motion or vote from Parliament which isn't needed for a ceremonial funeral.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two is simply who is in the coffin. State funerals are reserved only for monarchy, while ceremonial funerals tend to be reserved for the spouse or family of a monarch but can \"be extended to exceptionally distinguished persons\"<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\"></a>.</p><h2><strong>All That c her</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9980312/Margaret-Thatcher-Dont-waste-money-on-a-flypast-at-my-funeral.html\">Lord Bell</a>, Thatcher did not want to lie in state for the public to pay their respects, and she won't. But the highly visible involvement of military personnel in her funeral will mean that it will resemble a state funeral.</p><h2><strong>Flagging an issue</strong></h2><p>When Buckingham Palace initially refused to fly flags at half-mast following Lady Diana's premature death, the royal family confronted a public outcry the likes of which they hadn't seen in years, and haven't seen since. Yet the decision to fly the flag at half-mast for Thatcher was made almost instantly, despite this being only the third time that this honour was bestowed on an individual not from the royal family.</p><p>You can find a list of famous and infamous state and ceremonial funerals along with details, where possible, on cost.

But - short of analysing the correlation between receiving welfare and being capable of manslaughter in order to frame a former lover - this isn't easy to do. So we've provided some numbers that give this horrific case some context.</p><h2>Family size</h2><p>Your first clue that the Philpotts might not be representative of a typical British family is that they had 17 children. In 1996, there were 3.1 million families with just one dependent child. In 2012, that figure had risen to 3.7 million. That also represents a greater proportion, since in 1996, 42% of all families had only one child aged under 16 (or aged under 18 and in full-time education) but by 2012, that was the case for 48% of families.</p><p>For the biggest of British families, those with eight or more dependent children, the number has remained constant at approximately 2,000 families. On average, British families are having <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/mar/25/family-size\">fewer children</a>.</p><h2>Family size and welfare</h2><p>Of those large families, only a fraction receive government welfare. In 2011, 130 families with ten children received some form of out-of-work benefit. And for the very biggest famillies, those with 14 or more children, so few receive benefits that the number is deemed negligible.</p><p>Facts like these can be conspicuously absent in headlines like \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2083998/Benefit-cap-190-families-10-children-cost-taxpayers-11m-A-YEAR.html\">the 190 families with ten children who cost you more than £11million in benefits</a>\". That's because it's not until the third paragraph that it's explained that huge state benefit sums are what these big families are \"eligible\" for - not what they're actually receiving.</p><p>Previous <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savethechildren.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2FChallenging_12_myths_and_stereotypes.pdf&ei=P4BdUdf3E8jYPNPQgYAB&usg=AFQjCNGkSvzzjQ-GtZ2YohtCvh9VA5lkkw&sig2=LhTwT74Tx7gaBNbawUba4g&bvm=bv.44770516,d.ZWU\">studies</a> by the Department for Work and Pensions found that the proportion of couple families with one parent in work differs little whether a family has three children (90%) or has one (92%) or two children (94%).</p><h2>Family size and types of welfare</h2><p>The emotion-fuelled benefit debate which the Philpott tragedy has further fuelled has also neglected to take apart the wide variety of assistance that the term 'benefits' captures.</p><p>Often forgotten is the fact that it's not just the unemployed that receive benefits. For instance, in 2010/11 HMRC <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savethechildren.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2FChallenging_12_myths_and_stereotypes.pdf&ei=P4BdUdf3E8jYPNPQgYAB&usg=AFQjCNGkSvzzjQ-GtZ2YohtCvh9VA5lkkw&sig2=LhTwT74Tx7gaBNbawUba4g&bvm=bv.44770516,d.ZWU\">paid more</a> in Child Tax Credit to parents in work (£12.8 billion) than it did to those out of work (£7.6 billion).</p><p>On average, 28% of families receiving some form of out-of-work benefit are receiving a severe disablement allowance or incapacity benefits. The reaction of those prompt to discuss 'scroungers' may be to suggest that many of these disability claims are dishonest. But if <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/datablog/2013/mar/13/housing-benefit-overpayment\">housing benefit</a> is anything to go by, 'benefit cheats' can't be blamed for all our welfare woes. According to this <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2FRP12-59.pdf&ei=L4hdUY3aBeuB7Qaao4CoCA&usg=AFQjCNEHKgi6lmqya_G7_RMdQ0znNmDgMA&sig2=4ZqPT0Q3xsaHnuqQyJ37mQ&bvm=bv.44770516,d.ZGU\">House of Commons Report</a>, overpayment accounts for 2% of the annual Department for Work and Benefits spend - amounting to £3.2bn. In 2011/12, £1.1bn of that overspend was due to fraud, but £1.3bn was due to official error (which are deemed non-recoverable).</p><h2>Misusing benefits</h2><p>Research by <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savethechildren.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2FChallenging_12_myths_and_stereotypes.pdf&ei=P4BdUdf3E8jYPNPQgYAB&usg=AFQjCNGkSvzzjQ-GtZ2YohtCvh9VA5lkkw&sig2=LhTwT74Tx7gaBNbawUba4g&bvm=bv.44770516,d.ZWU\">Save the Children</a> also counters the suggestion that Philpott is representative of others since \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2303071/Mick-Philpotts-story-shows-pervasiveness-evil-born-welfare-dependency.html\">his booze, his drugs... were paid for by a benefit system</a>\". They found that \"only 2.7% of families in Britain have an alcohol dependent parent, and 0.9% a drug dependent parent\". What's more, research published in the book '<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=V7ngfz2CmT0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=+Strelitz+J+*+Lister+R.+2008+Why+Money+Matters:+Family+income,poverty+and+children%E2%80%99s+lives++Save+the+Children+&ots=ABxVl_-IdU&sig=ZGyOELBRbw7K2oqTfPpF6BnrrPg#v=onepage&q&f=false\">Why Money Matters</a>' claims that 'low income parents are more likely to spend extra financial support provided through the benefits system on their children than better off parents'.</p><p>All of which begs the question, if \"<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/4508014/The-Sun-says-Building-for-the-future.html\">the welfare system helped him [Philpott] every step of the way</a>\" then why is this story so uniquely tragic?

From graphics explaining the economy or government spending, to background information on events, to in-depth analysis of huge news events like the UK's riots of 2011, data has been a core component of the Guardian's coverage.</p><p>As important to that approach is sharing the data we find and collect, and how we approach it, to allow it to be built on, analysed and improved by our readers. This has been the at the core of the Datablog since its first post in 2009, and is as important now as ever it was – and this book is our latest contribution to these efforts.

In the 19th century, the gentry were those that never worked but today, people that have never worked, along with the long-term unemployed, form the lowest rung of <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html\">socio-economic classification</a> for the Office for National Statistics (ONS). </p><p><a href=\"https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/class/\">The Great British Class Survey results</a> published by the BBC today claims to brush away the traditional upper, middle and working class categorisation and, based on the responses of over 161,000 people, attempts to replace it with the (less catchy?) Elite, Established Middle Class, Technical Middle Class, New Affluent Workers, Traditional Working Class, Emergent Service Workers and the Precarious Proletariat.</p><p>Changes in definition aren't just about changes in the socio-economic make up of Britain. They're as much about changes in the way we perceive what constitutes difference and similarity between ourselves. </p><p>So, where once riding a bike and having only one pair of shoes may have been an indicator of meagre earnings and weak social status, they might now suggest the ethical choices of a highly skilled professional. This is partly because the architecture of British social hierarchy has undergone huge shifts as a result of broader changes in social, economic and cultural life. </p><p>The fact that there are so many components that make up class - and that they are based on perceptions and belief as well as fact - makes social class extremely difficult to measure. The Great British Class Survey has nevertheless had a go. Here, we consider some of the merits and limitations of their research.</p><h2><strong>Class room</strong></h2><p>Education was one of the topics omitted from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22000973\">online class calculator</a> launched today. Despite the huge success of a handful of uneducated entrepreneurs, level of education completed as well as the type of school attended remain huge determinants of social mobility in Britain. For the poorest fifth in society, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-mobility-data-charts#\">46% have mothers with no qualifications at all</a> whereas for the richest it's only 3%.</p><p>And parents remain a powerful predictor of what class you're in and the class you're capable of moving to. From the two most primitive of indicators - how much money you have and how many generations you've had it for - there has been a gradual shift over the years from placing importance on the latter to emphasising the former. Despite this, inter-generational changes in class are still small. In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/public-finance/chapter%205%20gfg%202010.pdf\">link between individual and parental earnings</a> was found to be the strongest in the UK than any other OECD country. Many argue that the British educational system can reproduce and reinforce these trends. A 2012 <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/education-at-a-glance-2012_eag-2012-en\">report</a>, also from the OECD found that British schools were more socially segregated than in any other developed country.</p><p>As well as education, questions about spending habits were omitted from the online class calculator. Though these might not be entirely accurate (individuals who can afford private healthcare may choose to use the NHS all the same) questions about where someone goes on holiday and where they do their supermarket shop might provide clues about their socio-economic status. What's more, asking about savings, annual earnings and home ownership (included in the class calculator) might not provide the full picture of wealth as they omit to ask about debt.</p><h2><strong>Working class</strong></h2><p>The online class calculator does not ask about your own job title. <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/savage.aspx\">Professor Mike Savage</a> from the London School of Economics (LSE), one of the authors of the survey, was reluctant to rely on this in the research claiming that \"our economy and our lifestyles have changed profoundly since these categories were invented so this may no longer hold true.\" However, the online calculator does use professional titles when asking 'which of these people do you know socially?' This in turn, has several problems of its own.</p><p>Knowing someone 'socially' is open to interpretation. A casual acquaintance or a close friend could equally be included under this question. So, the way that a respondent interprets the question may be influenced by their desired outcome. In other words, if a person perceives themselves as a particular class or is hoping for a particular result from the class calculator the way they define their social network may be biased. </p><h2><strong>World class</strong></h2><p>Almost every study measuring social class is of limited use when making comparisons between countries. Whilst going to stately homes may be an indicator of class in Britain, it doesn't mean much in non-Western countries where stately homes don't exist or where religion plays a crucial role in determining social status. Even economic indicators are not without their limitations. For example, asking about home ownership might not prove so helpful in a country such as France which has a long culture of renting.</p><h2><strong>A class of one's own</strong></h2><p>Some have argued that whether you use seven categories or the traditional three, class is not as important in British society as it once was. A report by the think tank Civitas published last year titled '<a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/socialmobilitydelusions2012.pdf\">Social Mobility Delusions</a>' claimed that \"more than half of us are in a different class from the one we were born into\". Just as the subjects chosen and the wording of questions in the online class calculator influenced results, the definition of class can make an enormous impact on a report's findings. Real life can be similarly influenced by hypotheses. The way that someone interprets their own place in British society can affect self-esteem, ambition and achievement.</p><p>Perhaps that's why class is still a crucial tool for those in marketing trying to sell us products or those in politics trying to buy our votes. </p><p>What do you think about the new class categories suggested by the BBC poll?

But the six come into effect on or after 1 April include some of the biggest and most high profile cuts, such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2013/mar/28/bedroom-tax-map\">Bedroom Tax</a>, the household welfare cap, and the abolition of council tax benefit.</p><p>These new reforms will take £2.3bn a year out of the pockets of some of Britain's poorest households in 2013-14 alone. According to CPAG:</p><blockquote><p>The £2.3 billion figure represents how much is cut from support for how income households compared to last year (2012/13). However, households have already faced significant cuts since 2010/11. So in 2013/14 the government will be spending £16.5bn less on social security and tax credits than it was in 2010/11. The majority of these cuts impact on the finances of low income families.</p></blockquote><p>CPAG adds that by 2014/15, the cumulative effect of cuts to social security and tax credits since 2010 will be £22bn annually relative to 2010/11.</p><p>The list of six does not include another major reform beginning this year - replacement of disability living allowance with personal independence payments - which will by 2016 save an estimated £1bn a year as an estimated 500,000 disabled people have their claim removed.</p><p>The CPAG calculation does not include a further non-dependent deduction increase in April 2013 for claimants in private rented accommodation, or the the social fund, which has cut and localised into 150 local welfare schemes which will offer food vouchers in lieu of crisis loans. </p><p>Nor does it include the biggest reform of all, Universal Credit, which will be tested in a handful of areas before being rolled out from October 2013. CPAG says it was not included because its mid-year introduction means it is too difficult to calculate its impact.</p><p>Universal credit intended to simply the benefit system by wrapping seven means tested unemployment benefits and tax credits into a single payment. The government argues that this will make it easier for claimants to afford to move from benefits into work.</p><p>The work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith claims that 2.6m households will have higher entitlements as a result of universal credit, 1.3m of them by over £25 a week. He claims it will lift 350,000 children out of poverty, and that no one will be worse off under the new system. He says:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The early introduction of Universal Credit demonstrates our ongoing commitment to transforming the welfare system and will improve the lives of millions of claimants by incentivising work and making work pay.</p></blockquote><p>But campaigners some groups will lose out: around 450,000 disabled people according to Disability Rights UK; while 400,000 of the poorest families - especially single parent households with children - will be worse off by 2015, according to the Chartered Institute of Housing.</p><p>The government argues that raising the personal tax allowance in April will offset the financial impact of some of these cuts. But CPAG says it will do little to help the poorest households: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The working poor generally rely on housing benefit and council tax benefit, so get 85% of the gain from the raising of the tax allowance taken away again because of tapers that mean their benefit is withdrawn as their income rises.</p></blockquote><p>Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Families already struggling with rising living costs face another body blow as a potentially devastating package of benefit cuts is introduced this month which will grab desperately needed financial help away from families and suck billions of pounds of spending power out of local businesses and communities.</p></blockquote><p>The data is below for you to download.

UK property site Rightmove have attempted to find out in a nationwide survey<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Download the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Whether it was 'space', 'investment', 'safety' or quite simply 'contentment', homes in East London report the lowest levels of happiness in the UK according to research published today by property website<a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/articles/rightmove-news/happy-at-home-index-london\"> Rightmove</a>. </p><p>The survey of almost 40,000 people also found that nine of the 10 'unhappiest' places to live were to be found in Greater London. Harrogate in Yorkshire came top of the list as the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/news/datablog/2013/mar/27/uk-towns-happiness-ranking\">'happiest town' to live in in the UK</a>.</p><p>Carlisle, which was considered the happiest town in 2012 has since dropped to 19th place. Meanwhile, towns in Greater London continue to languish at the bottom of the chart. East London, which received the lowest score in 2012, again had the fewest respondents reporting happiness in 2013. </p><p><strong>How do you define happiness?</strong></p><p>Rightmove's <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/files/2013/03/Rightmove-Happy-At-Home-Index-2013.pdf\">approach</a> was to ask people in 110 UK towns to what extent they agreed with 12 statements ranging from 'I often feel unsafe in the community in which I live' to 'I do not worry about the value of my property'. </p><p>But not all of the statements in the survey necessarily reflect upon towns. For example, the first statement 'on the whole, the décor and furnishings in my home are to my liking' might be more indicative of the socio-economic background of the individual completing the survey, than of the town under scrutiny. As it turns out, Cleveland in the North East comes top for residents satisfaction with their own décor, but ranks 64th overall in the index. </p><p>Similarly, a negative response to the statement 'generally, I feel relaxed when I am at home' may say more about family life than the town in which the respondent lives. Here again, the correlation between this response and the overall results is relatively weak. </p><p>Harrogate which comes first overall, ranks in 79th place for residents feeling relaxed at home. It is also not clear whether the 40,000 respondents were drawn in equal measure for the 110 towns included in the survey. Clearly, if five people were asked their views on Stockport (2nd place) and 1,000 people were asked about their homes in Croydon (109th place), the findings would be highly skewed. </p><p>There was however a strong correlation between responses on 'neighbourliness' (captured by Rightmove in the statement 'I enjoy spending time in the area in which I live') and a town's overall score. In Greater London where the lowest scores were recorded, respondents were inclined to strongly disagree with this statement.</p><p>Do you agree with these rankings for your town?

What do the numbers show us about how busy these MPs are?<br /><br />• <a href=\"#data\">Download the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Ministers in the UK government are considering whether to take action on one of the most sensitive and potentially contentious issues at Westminster: limiting the rights of MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to vote and decide on \"England only\" legislation.</p><p>But that in turn raises an equally thorny issue: if non-English MPs are to have a more restricted role in the Commons, are as many needed? Are they as busy as they once were? Scottish Tories are privately suggesting the numbers of Scottish MPs might need to be cut: a move which would most likely reduce the number of Labour MPs at Westminster the most.</p><p>There was evidence in the earlier years of devolution that MPs from other parts of the UK were often much less busy, but a new Guardian survey suggests that is no longer true: Scottish and Welsh MPs in particular are amongst the busiest at Westminster – particularly the Scottish National party. Compared to the early years of devolution, when MPs had not yet adjusted, today's non-England MPs are highly active.</p><p>It is a debate best known as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/17/what-is-west-lothian-question\">West Lothian question</a> – posed in 1977 by the then Labour MP for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell. </p><p>A critic of devolution of Westminster's law-making powers to the proposed Scottish assembly, Dalyell conundrum was this: why, under devolution, Scottish MPs could still vote on English policies while English MPs could not vote on devolved Scottish affairs?</p><p>Variants of this question have been around since the late 1800s, tied then to proposals for Irish home rule. But, after 14 years of devolution of wide-ranging and increasing powers to the Scottish and Welsh legislatures, and the successful reformation of Northern Ireland's powerful assembly, that question is still very live.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/report-of-the-commission-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons/\">McKay Commission inquiry</a> set up by UK ministers stated that an answer to the West Lothian question was needed, to ensure the Commons better reflected the specific interests of England, given that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have domestic legislatures controlling large areas of policy and law-making.</p><p>While it rejected cutting the number of non-England MPs on principle, as that would undermine Westminster's role as the ultimate law-making body for the UK, it recommended that new measures and policies were put in place to ensure that in future, England-only bills were framed by only MPs from English seats. They would not have a veto to overrule the whole parliament, but the basic principle ought to be \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/25/english-only-votes-legislation-commission\">English votes for English laws</a>\".</p><p>McKay stated: \"The status quo clearly cannot be sustained. Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail. We expect that governments will prefer compromise to conflict.\"</p><p>The Guardian survey has used three core activities in the Commons to compare how active MPs from the different nations are: voting, participating in debates and placing written parliamentary questions.</p><p>These three tests – the most visible of activities – have given us a snapshot picture of how busy MPs from the different parts of the UK have been at Westminster. We used data from <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">theyworkforyou.com</a> on how many questions they asked and debates they spoke in for the year from 1 February 2012, and figures from <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/\">publicwhip.org.uk</a> for every vote since the 2010 general election.</p><p>It was designed to test how devolution of often significant legal and policy-making powers to the three devolved legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast has reduced or changed the workload and work rate of MPs from those nations and regions.</p><p>The Guardian's study has found Scottish and Welsh MPs are often as active as their English counterparts – in some case more so. The results for Northern Ireland are more complicated: its five Sinn Fein MPs as supporters of a reunited Ireland, do not take up their seats on principle. Even so, the performance of Northern Irish MPs is very mixed.</p><p>Our survey, which captured every vote in since the 2010 election and all debates and parliament questions for the last year, gives a snapshot comparison of how national groups of MPs behave. It has found that:</p><blockquote><p>1. Scottish MPs voted on average in 65% of all votes, and Welsh MPs in 73%, compared to 75% of votes by English MPs on average. This is narrower gap than 10 years ago, perhaps reflecting the significance of UK-wide policies such as welfare, the economy, and defence, and the much tighter political balance in the Commons, which means votes can be closer.</p><p>2. The six Scottish National party MPs, who have a largely observed policy not to vote on bills which have no direct impact on Scotland, only took part in 47.6% of votes.</p><p>3. Northern Irish MPs, even excluding the five abstentionist Sinn Fein MPs who refuse on principle to take their seats at Westminster, only took part in 45% of all votes compared to 76% by English MPs or 65% by Scottish MPs.</p><p>This could reflect Stormont's far greater degree of control over domestic policy in Northern Ireland, which includes welfare and pensions. Even so, they spoke in 57 debates last year on average, against 37 for English MPs.</p><p>4. SNP, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs were – on average – more likely to speak in parliamentary debates last year: SNP MPs took part in 44 debates on average, against an average of 37 debates for English MPs. Welsh MPs spoke in 43.7 debates. But Northern Irish MPs spoke the most: excluding the four Sinn Fein abstainers, they took part in 57 debates each on average.</p><p>5. And SNP MPs – now repeatedly probing the UK government over independence-related issues – were, as a group, again top of the chart for asking parliamentary questions.</p><p>On average, the six SNP MPs asked 131 questions last year, because Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader and defence spokesman, tabled 345 Pqs, with Mike Weir putting down 174 and Eilidh Whiteford 113. This average was nearly double the Scottish average of just under 70 questions and well above the English average of 55 PQ.s</p><p>6. Welsh MPs were also very active with parliamentary questions: they averaged 76.5 each in the year from February 2012 and 2013.</p><p>7. Some of the overall totals are skewed by extremely active individual MPs. For example, the Scottish MP Tom Greatrex, a shadow Labour energy minister, asked 515 PQ.s, while the Welsh Labour backbencher Chris Ruane asked 601 PQ.s – the record in our snapshot survey.</p><p>By comparison, the median or midpoint number for Pqs tabled by Scottish MPs is 34 and 32 for Welsh MPs, against 30 for English MPs.</p></blockquote><p>The West Lothian question leapt to life several times under Tony Blair's Labour government: some Tory MPs, including senior figures such as former leader William Hague, Ken Clarke and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, argue it is wrong for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs to have undue control over bills and policies only affecting England.</p><p>The McKay inquiry stated that \"the political resonance of the West Lothian question is at its greatest\" when a UK government uses MPs from outside England to control the Commons, to outvote English opposition MPs.</p><p>The commission said these occasions are very rare: it has not happened in the post-devolution era and previously only between 1964 and 66, and briefly in early 1974, when England returned a Tory majority and Labour needed Scottish and Welsh backbenchers to force through legislation.</p><p>The commission did not mention that in 1965, Ulster unionist MPs allied with the Tory opposition to vote down Harold Wilson's plan to nationalise the steel industry: he was furious, as there was no steel industry in Northern Ireland.</p><p>There is a second scenario: where a government in power has used MPs from non-English seats to overcome a rebellion by its own backbenchers on English or English and Welsh legislation.</p><p>This happened twice for Labour since devolution situation, over foundation hospitals and tuition fees, when Scottish backbenchers voted en masse in favour of English and Welsh measures opposed by many English Labour MPs, saving Tony Blair's bills.</p><p>In parallel with these debates, researchers with University College London's constitution unit and think tanks found evidence that Scottish MPs caught up in the immediate post-devolution period were less busy but also often behaved as if devolution had not occurred.</p><p>Guy Lodge, a leading devolution analyst now with the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Oonagh Gay, found that Scottish MPs took part in fewer votes between 1999 and 2001. Lodge did a further study which found that in 2002-03, Scottish MPs were still putting questions to ministers with much less or no direct relevance to Scottish affairs, including the Home Office, transport and culture.</p><p>A study by Akash Paun, published in the constitution unit's \"The State of the Nations 2008\", found that in 2006 English Labour backbenchers spent far more on postage than their Scottish and Welsh counterparts: £4,137 versus £2,866 by Scottish backbenchers and £2,773 by Welsh. (The overall differential was lower: £3,633 on average for all English MPs versus £2,885 for Scottish MPs and £2,555 for Welsh.)</p><p>Paun also found that in 2004 English MPs did an average of 31.8 hours on constituency and local work, versus 24.4hrs by Scottish MPs and 27.6 by Welsh.</p><p>Compared to MPs moulded in the pre-devolution era when the Commons controlled all the UK's policies, devolution analysts such as Alan Trench and senior figures in the UK parties believe that MPs from devolved areas have adapted. They now have a better understanding of how to make Westminster work for them, when half their constituency work was gone.</p><p>The latest generation of MPs, particularly those newly elected in May 2010, are said to be more aware of the significant role they can play in the Commons on reserved powers, like the economy, welfare, trade and defence. Their constituency workload is much reduced: so they switch to UK level politics and policy.</p><p>(Welsh MPs do have more reserved powers to work on: the Home Office in London, for instance, still controls policing and courts in Wales. It does not do so in Scotland.)</p><p>But perhaps more significantly, Scottish and Welsh MPs are more active and visible in the Commons because the Tories are in power. As Scotland and Wales tend to elect proportionately more Labour MPs and have strong nationalist parties, so the Commons becomes their main battleground. Likewise, when the Tories were in opposition, the power and influence of non-England MPs at Westminster was a source of irritation and grievance.</p><p>In 2010, Scotland elected 41 Labour MPs out of 59, while Wales returned 26 Labour MPs out of 41. When Labour was in government these backbenchers were able to influence policy and get things done through direct contact with ministers. Any questions could be raised with a letter or a quiet word.</p><p>With Labour now in opposition: using parliamentary questions and debates is the main method for challenging the government. Envigorated by Alex Salmond's control of the Scottish parliament and next year's independence referendum, the SNP's six MPs are also very active, as this survey has shown.</p><p>If Alex Salmond's Scottish National party and the pro-independence movement loses the referendum on 18 September 2014, devolution of powers to Holyrood is expected to accelerate, which could in turn raise fresh questions about the role and number of non-English MPs in the Commons. If Salmond wins, this question is moot for Scotland: the SNP will have decisively answered the West Lothian question. For Wales, however, an independent Scotland could accelerate devolution to Cardiff.</p><p>After 2015, Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are all considering an increase in Scotland's tax-raising and borrowing powers, and is studying devolving control over parts of welfare and social security. Under the Scotland Act 2012, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/mar/21/scotland-power-set-income-tax-2016\">2016 Scotland will already set its own income tax rate</a>, raising £5.6bn worth of its own spending.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson joined with senior Scottish Labour and Lib Dem figures by agreeing that Holyrood could get even greater tax powers after 2015.</p><p>Several influential think tanks, including Reform Scotland which has members from all three main UK parties, and the Institute for Public Policy Research, are pushing for greater Scottish control over tax and welfare.</p><p>In Wales, all the parties – including senior figures in the Tory party – are debating seeking more legislative powers, including control over policing, currently reserved to Westminster, and their first powers over tax-raising. The Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont (the UK's longest running devolved legislature) already has wide-ranging, substantial autonomy, but has been pressing for control over corporation tax.</p><p>Observers and insiders alike believe the UK government will delay any action on implementing McKay's recommendations until after next year's Scottish referendum. But that will take Westminster so close to the 2015 general election, the pace and intensity of devolution will speed up. If it does, the West Lothian question and McKay's solution are likely to become more pressing.</p><p><em>Notes: This study is designed to provide a snapshot of MPs' performance, by collecting total figures for MPs from all four parts of the UK. It includes every MP from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and compares them to a control group of 100 MPs from English constituencies.</p><p>The debates and parliamentary questions figures come from <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">theyworkforyou.com</a>. It gathers and stores data only for the previous 365 days. Our data on these two tests covers the 365 days from 1 February 2012.</p><p>This means that in some cases, an individual MP's figures for questions and debates will vary from one day or week to the next: if they placed a large group of questions on the days before or after our 365 day window, their overall figure would change.</p><p>The voting figures come from <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/\">publicwhip.org.uk</a> are a percentage of all votes staged since 25 May 2010, when the current parliament was convened.

We bring you all the data going back to the 1940s<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Get the data</a></p><p>How bad is Britain's deficit? The latest set of figures show that Britain's public finances showed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/21/uk-government-borrowing-ons-psnb-4g\">a much smaller than expected deficit</a> in February.</p><p>The<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/february-2013/stb---february-2013.html\"> Office for National Statistics said</a> the public sector current budget deficit was £1.1bn in February - this is a £7.1bn lower deficit than the same time last year.</p><p>The Guardian writes today: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>February's figures are flattered by a known £2.6bn transfer of cash from the Bank of England under a deal to return gilt interest to the government, and £2.3bn from the sale of next-generation mobile phone frequencies.</p><p>But underlying performance was also strong, with a drop in local government spending and stronger central government tax receipts.</p><p>Since the start of the tax year in April 2012, borrowing has totalled £94.9bn, excluding a one-off boost from the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets. This is 8.9% lower than at the same point in the 2011-12 tax year, and with one month left of the fiscal year, Osborne is in a strong position to meet his new full-year goal of borrowing no more than £114.5bn – just over 7% of GDP.</p></blockquote><h2>UK public debt</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>We have the complete set of data on Government borrowing, all the way back to the 1940s. All political parties have faced their fair share of debt through the years - almost as if the economic climate has its own life independent of who is managing it. </p><p>What is the deficit? When the ONS talks about the deficit, they take a simple measure - the gap between what's coming into the government in taxes and receipts versus what's being spent. Most commentators look at net borrowing as the deficit figure, because it includes investment spending. It's different to the national debt - which is the total the country owes.</p><p>So last month the budget was in deficit. Here are the key facts for November - if you exclude the temporary effects of the financial interventions in the banks:</p><blockquote><p>• Public sector net borrowing was £2.8bn in February 2013; this is a £9bn lower net borrowing than in February 2012, when net borrowing was £11.8bn.<br />• Public sector current budget deficit was £1.1bn in February 2013; this is a £7.1bn lower deficit than in February 2012, when there was a deficit of £8.1bn.<br />• For the period April 2012 to February 2013, public sector net borrowing (excluding the effects of the Royal Mail Pension Plan transfer in April 2012 and the transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility) was £101.3bn; this is £2.9bn lower net borrowing than in the same period the previous year, when net borrowing was £104.2bn.<br />• February 2013 public sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) was reduced by £2.7bn as a result of cash transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund to Government and by £2.3bn as a result of proceeds from the 4G spectrum auction.<br />• Public sector net debt was £1,161.5bn at the end of February 2013, equivalent to 73.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).<br />• In 2012/13, public sector net borrowing and public sector current budget deficit are reduced by £6.4bn as a result of cash transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund to Government.<br />• In 2012/13, public sector net borrowing and public sector net investment are reduced by £28bn as a result of the transfer of the Royal Mail Pension Plan in April 2012.<br /> </p></blockquote><p>The ONS <a href=\"#data\">data below</a> shows monthly, quarterly and annual debt and deficit - what can you do with it?</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a><br />• <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdEdNdWlxdGhJVHE1WE9OYlVQazZUcWc&hl=en\">DATA: download the full list as a spreadsheet</a></p><h2>More data</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p>• <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/general-election-2010\">General election 2010</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy\">Economic policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth\">Economic growth (GDP)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending\">Tax and spending</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance\">Public finance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/government-borrowing\">Government borrowing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition\">Liberal-Conservative coalition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/spending-review\">Spending review 2010</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliakollewe\">Julia Kollewe</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simonrogers\">Simon Rogers</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But how common are they?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu\">Global Terrorism Database</a> has recorded terror attacks across the world - with data from 1970 covering up to the end of 2011. It's a huge dataset: over 104,000 attacks, including around 2,600 in the US - and its collection is funded by an agency of the US government: the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/st-centers-excellence\">Science and Technology Directorate</a> of the US Department of Homeland Security through a Center of Excellence program based at the University of Maryland.</p><p>There is a lot of detail in there - and it shows how there are actually fewer attacks now than in the 1970s. There were a total of 207 terrorist attacks in the US between 2001 and 2011. They went down from a high of 40 in 2001 to nine in 2011. The smallest number of attacks occurred in 2006 when the database recorded six. Between 2001 and 2011, it shows a total of 21 fatal terror attacks.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>But the other side of that is the more recent attacks have been incredibly deadly - with 9/11 obviously dominating the data. This great post from the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/16/eight-facts-about-terrorism-in-the-united-states/\">Washington Post</a> points this - and more - out. It's based on this report from the <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu/start/publications/START_IUSSDDataTerroristAttacksUS_1970-2011.pdf\">National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism</a>, reporting on last year's GTD figures. </p><p>The biggest caveat about these figures is that these are all attacks, not necessarily those that cause more loss of life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>This chart of total attacks shows how 9/11 distorts the total figures - comprising 85% of all the terror deaths recorded. Those other peaks? The 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the 1984 wounding peak was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Rajneeshee_bioterror_attack\">Rajneeshee bioterror attack</a> where restaurants were deliberately contaminated with salmonella. One caveat on the 9/11 figures is the number of wounded - which here is not from teh GTD. As they say:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />We report the number of wounded as unknown because of the wide discrepancy in reports on the World Trade Center attacks. Unlike total fatalities, no official totals have ever been given for injuries, and reports vary considerably. For example, some reports suggest that over 2,000 first responders alone were injured, while others suggest that total number of wounded is somewhere in the hundreds. The general consensus (though not \"our\" number) is that more than 2,000 people were injured in the attacks on World Trade Center towers 9/11. For further reference too <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9087/index1.html\">RAND</a> lists it as 2261, but even they note that it probably isn't terribly accurate.</p></blockquote><p>Very few parts of the US have managed to avoid attacks of one sort or another. We've mapped the database, using CartoDB. Click the image below to explore it.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The data also shows how the nature of those attacks have changed too. As the Post points out: \"Bombings have dropped in popularity over the last decade — accounting for just 27% of the attacks since 2001 … And, notably, guns have never figured heavily in US terrorist attacks\".</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/terrorism-in-us-real-threat-level\">Harry Enten writes</a>, the Boston attack is unusual for a number of reasons:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>About the only characteristic that perhaps doesn't fit the conventional pattern is that it occurred at a sports event, rather than the target being a government building or business. Indeed, the targeting of ordinary civilian members of the public is the truly scary part of the Boston Marathon bombing: with the exception of the Atlanta Olympics bombing of 1996, the idea of attacking a sports event in the United States is novel and unusual.</p></blockquote><p>The final point is a sense of perspective: bad as the number of US attacks are, there are far fewer there than in many countries around the world.</p><p>Here are the key findings from the report:</p><blockquote><p>• The highest proportion of unsuccessful attacks since 1970 occurred in 2011 - four out of nine recorded attacks were unsuccessful<br />• From 2001 to 2011 California (40) and New York (19) experienced the most total terrorist attacks against the US homeland<br />• The three cities in the United States that experienced the most attacks from 2001 to 2011 were New York City (12), Washington, DC (9) and Los Angeles (8)<br />• The most common weapons used in terrorist attacks in the United States from 2001 to 2011 were bombs (53% of all weapons used) and explosives (20% of all weapons used)<br />• For the period from 2001 to 2011, biological weapons were tied with firearms as the third most common weapon used in terrorist attacks (both represented 8% of all weapons used).

But how common are they?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu\">Global Terrorism Database</a> has recorded terror attacks across the world - with data from 1970 covering up to the end of 2011. It's a huge dataset: over 104,000 attacks, including around 2,600 in the US - and its collection is funded by an agency of the US government: the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/st-centers-excellence\">Science and Technology Directorate</a> of the US Department of Homeland Security through a Center of Excellence program based at the University of Maryland.</p><p>There is a lot of detail in there - and it shows how there are actually fewer attacks now than in the 1970s. There were a total of 207 terrorist attacks in the US between 2001 and 2011. They went down from a high of 40 in 2001 to nine in 2011. The smallest number of attacks occurred in 2006 when the database recorded six. Between 2001 and 2011, it shows a total of 21 fatal terror attacks.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>But the other side of that is the more recent attacks have been incredibly deadly - with 9/11 obviously dominating the data. This great post from the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/16/eight-facts-about-terrorism-in-the-united-states/\">Washington Post</a> points this - and more - out. It's based on this report from the <a href=\"http://www.start.umd.edu/start/publications/START_IUSSDDataTerroristAttacksUS_1970-2011.pdf\">National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism</a>, reporting on last year's GTD figures. </p><p>The biggest caveat about these figures is that these are all attacks, not necessarily those that cause more loss of life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>This chart of total attacks shows how 9/11 distorts the total figures - comprising 85% of all the terror deaths recorded. Those other peaks? The 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the 1984 wounding peak was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Rajneeshee_bioterror_attack\">Rajneeshee bioterror attack</a> where restaurants were deliberately contaminated with salmonella. One caveat on the 9/11 figures is the number of wounded - which here is not from teh GTD. As they say:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />We report the number of wounded as unknown because of the wide discrepancy in reports on the World Trade Center attacks. Unlike total fatalities, no official totals have ever been given for injuries, and reports vary considerably. For example, some reports suggest that over 2,000 first responders alone were injured, while others suggest that total number of wounded is somewhere in the hundreds. The general consensus (though not \"our\" number) is that more than 2,000 people were injured in the attacks on World Trade Center towers 9/11. For further reference too <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9087/index1.html\">RAND</a> lists it as 2261, but even they note that it probably isn't terribly accurate.</p></blockquote><p>Very few parts of the US have managed to avoid attacks of one sort or another. We've mapped the database, using CartoDB. Click the image below to explore it.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The data also shows how the nature of those attacks have changed too. As the Post points out: \"Bombings have dropped in popularity over the last decade — accounting for just 27% of the attacks since 2001 … And, notably, guns have never figured heavily in US terrorist attacks\".</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/terrorism-in-us-real-threat-level\">Harry Enten writes</a>, the Boston attack is unusual for a number of reasons:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>About the only characteristic that perhaps doesn't fit the conventional pattern is that it occurred at a sports event, rather than the target being a government building or business. Indeed, the targeting of ordinary civilian members of the public is the truly scary part of the Boston Marathon bombing: with the exception of the Atlanta Olympics bombing of 1996, the idea of attacking a sports event in the United States is novel and unusual.</p></blockquote><p>The final point is a sense of perspective: bad as the number of US attacks are, there are far fewer there than in many countries around the world.</p><p>Here are the key findings from the report:</p><blockquote><p>• The highest proportion of unsuccessful attacks since 1970 occurred in 2011 - four out of nine recorded attacks were unsuccessful<br />• From 2001 to 2011 California (40) and New York (19) experienced the most total terrorist attacks against the US homeland<br />• The three cities in the United States that experienced the most attacks from 2001 to 2011 were New York City (12), Washington, DC (9) and Los Angeles (8)<br />• The most common weapons used in terrorist attacks in the United States from 2001 to 2011 were bombs (53% of all weapons used) and explosives (20% of all weapons used)<br />• For the period from 2001 to 2011, biological weapons were tied with firearms as the third most common weapon used in terrorist attacks (both represented 8% of all weapons used). This is due to the anthrax attacks in October 2001<br />• From 2001 to 2011, the most common targets of terrorists in the United States were businesses (62 attacks), private citizens and property (59 attacks), and government (43 attacks)<br />• The three terrorist organizations with the largest number of attacks on the US from 2001 to 2011 were the Earth Liberation Front (50), the Animal <br />Liberation Front (34) and al-Qa'ida (4)</p></blockquote><p>The data is <a href=\"#data\">below for you to download</a>.

Users were also able to see the information already submitted by others, including phone numbers and e-mail addresses so that they could contact others directly.</p><p>Using <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/\">Tableau</a>, we've shown how the number of offers of accommodation has changed over time as the link to the spreadsheet was shared on social media, news and official websites. The graph shows how in the space of two minutes, the number of offers increased from 3 to 85 and stayed high over the next ten minutes. This peaked again around an hour later, when 33 offers to help those needing shelter were received via Google. </p><p>As has been the case in the aftermath of other crises (such as the Mumbai attacks in 2011), social media has played a central role. Boston's mayor's office quickly tweeted information about which areas to avoid and Boston's police department used its twitter account to request information from members of the public, announce street closures and press conferences.</p><p>In fact, not tweeting was a decision which had to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BostonFire\">publicly justified</a> by Boston's fire department.</p><p><a href=\"http://trendsmap.com/\">Trendsmap</a> tracks twitter trends in real time and maps them using the location in users' twitter profiles.

A comprehensive list of every event in human history.</p><p>It matters because historians have long feared that we live in a <a href=\"http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla63/63kuny1.pdf\">digital dark ages</a> - where our history will have vanished when future generations try to look back on these electronic decades.</p><p>That is the purpose of <a href=\"http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/GDELT.html#.UWMC3-UnquE.twitter\">GDELT: Global Data on Events, Location and Tone</a>. Primarily set up by <a href=\"http://www.kalevleetaru.com/\">Kalev Leetaru at the University of Illinois</a> it is literally a giant list: over 250m events in over 300 categories from riots and protests to diplomatic exchanges and peace appeals. Crucially, it contains latitude and longitude for every event - all of them are now geotagged to city level.</p><p>It's based on an impressive rosta of news media: AfricaNews, Agence France Presse, Associated Press Online, Associated Press Worldstream, BBC Monitoring, Christian Science Monitor, Facts on File, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, United Press International, and the Washington Post. They include \"all national and international news coverage from the New York Times, all international and major US national stories from the Associated Press, and all national and international news from Google News with the exception of sports, entertainment, and strictly economic news.\"</p><p>And while it only goes back to 1979 now, eventually it will include all events back to 1800.</p><p><img src=\"http://jayyonamine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/animatedAFGEvents-1.gif\" width=\"460\"><strong></strong></p><p>Launched only recently, it's been used a PhD Jay Yonamine to <a href=\"http://jayyonamine.com/?p=645\">predict violence in Afghanistan</a>. He says that</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>From a forecasting perspective, the benefits of a machine-coded dataset updated in (near) real-time that provides specific latitude-longitude coordinates are numerous.</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, his paper points out that the news media probably does as good a job as official - but classified - data like Wikileaks when it comes to mapping that conflict. </p><p>The categories the team use could themselves be the subject of a dissertation: a <a href=\"http://eventdata.psu.edu/cameo.dir/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf\">300-strong taxonomy, CAMEO, developed by Penn State's Philip A. Schrodt</a>.</p><p>Says Kalev Leetaru (and <a href=\"http://eventdata.psu.edu/papers.dir/ISA.2013.GDELT.pdf\">his paper is worth reading too</a>)</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />The goal of the project is to create a free and open global resource for the quantitative study and mapping of global conflict and cooperation and thus the data is being made available completely free and open for any use. </p></blockquote><p>You can read <a href=\"http://ideas.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/10/what_can_we_learn_from_the_last_200_million_things_that_happened_in_the_world?wp_login_redirect=0\">more on this from Foreign Policy</a></p><p>It's a truly impressive project: and a power tool for anyone interested in data journalism too.

A comprehensive list of every event in human history.</p><p>It matters because historians have long feared that we live in a <a href=\"http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla63/63kuny1.pdf\">digital dark ages</a> - where our history will have vanished when future generations try to look back on these electronic decades.</p><p>That is the purpose of <a href=\"http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/GDELT.html#.UWMC3-UnquE.twitter\">GDELT: Global Data on Events, Location and Tone</a>. Primarily set up by <a href=\"http://www.kalevleetaru.com/\">Kalev Leetaru at the University of Illinois</a> it is literally a giant list: over 250m events in over 300 categories from riots and protests to diplomatic exchanges and peace appeals. Crucially, it contains latitude and longitude for every event - all of them are now geotagged to city level.</p><p>It's based on an impressive rosta of news media: AfricaNews, Agence France Presse, Associated Press Online, Associated Press Worldstream, BBC Monitoring, Christian Science Monitor, Facts on File, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, United Press International, and the Washington Post. They include \"all national and international news coverage from the New York Times, all international and major US national stories from the Associated Press, and all national and international news from Google News with the exception of sports, entertainment, and strictly economic news.\"</p><p>And while it only goes back to 1979 now, eventually it will include all events back to 1800.</p><p><img src=\"http://jayyonamine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/animatedAFGEvents-1.gif\" width=\"460\"><strong></strong></p><p>Launched only recently, it's been used a PhD Jay Yonamine to <a href=\"http://jayyonamine.com/?p=645\">predict violence in Afghanistan</a>.

Amnesty does not provide a precise figure of executions in China as Beijing keeps such figures secret.</p><p>China, together with Iran, North Korea, Yemen and the US (the only G7 country to still execute people) carried out the most executions last year. Excluding China, the report says:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>At least 1,722 people were sentenced to death in 58 countries in 2012. This is a decrease from 2011, when at least 1,923 people were known to have been sentenced in 63 countries worldwide, and a reduction for the second year running (2010: 2,024 death sentences in 67 countries). In 2012 Amnesty International recorded executions in 21 countries. It cannot be excluded that executions took place in Egypt and Syria, though none could be confirmed. This figure reflects the significant overall decline of the death penalty from a decade earlier, when 28 countries carried out executions in 2003. </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Latvia abolished the death penalty, meaning that there are nearly five times as many countries not executing prisoners as those that do in 2012.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Setting China aside, Amnesty said at least 680 executions were carried out last year - up by four on the previous year. Half of those took place in Iran (314). Iraq executed 129, Saudi Arabia 79 and the US 43. The minimum number of executions was down from at least 712 in 2009. </p><p>The Middle East saw 557 executions in six countries - the vast majority of the list. In Tunisia, 125 people on death row had their sentence commuted to life by the transitional government.</p><p>Methods of execution included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and various kinds of shooting (by firing squad, and at close range to the heart or the head). Public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. In Saudi Arabia, executions are usually beheadings with a sword. In one case recorded by Amnesty, a Sudanese man's head was sewn back onto his body and hung from a pole in a <br />public place.</p><p>Amnesty has given us the <a href=\"#data\">data</a>, right back to 2007.

Amnesty does not provide a precise figure of executions in China as Beijing keeps such figures secret.</p><p>China, together with Iran, North Korea, Yemen and the US (the only G7 country to still execute people) carried out the most executions last year. Excluding China, the report says:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>At least 1,722 people were sentenced to death in 58 countries in 2012. This is a decrease from 2011, when at least 1,923 people were known to have been sentenced in 63 countries worldwide, and a reduction for the second year running (2010: 2,024 death sentences in 67 countries). In 2012 Amnesty International recorded executions in 21 countries. It cannot be excluded that executions took place in Egypt and Syria, though none could be confirmed. This figure reflects the significant overall decline of the death penalty from a decade earlier, when 28 countries carried out executions in 2003. </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Latvia abolished the death penalty, meaning that there are nearly five times as many countries not executing prisoners as those that do in 2012.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Setting China aside, Amnesty said at least 680 executions were carried out last year - up by four on the previous year. Half of those took place in Iran (314). Iraq executed 129, Saudi Arabia 79 and the US 43. The minimum number of executions was down from at least 712 in 2009. </p><p>The Middle East saw 557 executions in six countries - the vast majority of the list. In Tunisia, 125 people on death row had their sentence commuted to life by the transitional government.</p><p>Methods of execution included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and various kinds of shooting (by firing squad, and at close range to the heart or the head). Public executions were known to have been carried out in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. In Saudi Arabia, executions are usually beheadings with a sword. In one case recorded by Amnesty, a Sudanese man's head was sewn back onto his body and hung from a pole in a <br />public place.</p><p>Amnesty has given us the <a href=\"#data\">data</a>, right back to 2007.

But 120 of the roles – a figure almost unchanged since the coalition's first parliamentary session – have gone to consultants, lobbyists, or senior managers and executives in charities and businesses.<br />In opposition, David Cameron referred to lobbying as \"the next big scandal waiting to happen\" and the coalition agreement included pledges on lobbying reform, including a statutory register of lobbyists. But as progress in these areas has stalled, transparency advocates have raised concerns over the unchanges status quo in the Lords.<br />Current parliamentary passholders include lobbyists working with the casino industry, consultants to defence firms, senior trade union officials, and political consultants to overseas governments and their proxies, including Kurdistan and Azerbaijan.<br />Among those listed on the current version of the register, dated 11 March 2013, are Lord Black of Brentwood – an executive director of the Telegraph Media Group – who sponsors a pass for the Telegraph's head of public affairs, Edward Taylor, and Lord Howard of Rising, who declares a pass to Richard Ritchie, the director of UK government affairs for BP.

But 120 of the roles – a figure almost unchanged since the coalition's first parliamentary session – have gone to consultants, lobbyists, or senior managers and executives in charities and businesses.<br />In opposition, David Cameron referred to lobbying as \"the next big scandal waiting to happen\" and the coalition agreement included pledges on lobbying reform, including a statutory register of lobbyists. But as progress in these areas has stalled, transparency advocates have raised concerns over the unchanges status quo in the Lords.<br />Current parliamentary passholders include lobbyists working with the casino industry, consultants to defence firms, senior trade union officials, and political consultants to overseas governments and their proxies, including Kurdistan and Azerbaijan.<br />Among those listed on the current version of the register, dated 11 March 2013, are Lord Black of Brentwood – an executive director of the Telegraph Media Group – who sponsors a pass for the Telegraph's head of public affairs, Edward Taylor, and Lord Howard of Rising, who declares a pass to Richard Ritchie, the director of UK government affairs for BP. Both Lord Howard and BP, however, say Ritchie has now retired from BP.</p></blockquote><p>Peers are allowed, under parliamentary rules, to give passes to people with outside employment and interests provided they are \"genuinely and personally providing parliamentary secretarial or research assistance to them\", and there is no suggestion any peer has broken any of these rules.</p><p>The full list of Lords staff who have declared outside interests, as at 11 March 2013, is below – let us know in the comments if you've spotted anything interesting.</p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGZHN1NrZXEwQ29WNy1jdTFYM3M0ZEE&usp=sharing\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p><h2>NEW!

We've taken a look at the different funeral options available and the potential costs<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Get the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Whether it's £8m or £10m, the estimated costs of Margaret Thatcher's funeral that are being widely reported don't seem to be based on any clear sources. Not here at the Datablog. We take a look at the different types of funeral to bury Britain's <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">'exceptionally distinguished'</a> commoners and consider the costs that might be incurred.</p><h2><strong>Big British funerals</strong></h2><p>If the estimates that are being circulated <em>are</em> correct, the funeral of Margaret Thatcher will be the most expensive in British history. The funeral of Sir Winston Churchill required £2,000 to cover the expenses of fire, police and civil defence services (the equivalent of almost £33,000 in 2012). Though policing costs aren't known, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">Queen Mother's funeral cost the Ministry of Defence</a> around £301,000 in 2002. </p><p>As well as the large numbers of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/10/margaret-thatcher-funeral-armed-forces\">armed forces already being drawn in</a> to the ceremony, it's likely that given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/police-arrests-thatcher-death-parties\">anti-Thatcher protests</a> have already required riot police, considerable security enforcement will probably be needed. Some of the expense will be covered by the estate of Lady Thatcher, though the government is <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/information-on-arrangements-for-lady-thatchers-funeral/\">not forthcoming</a> on the proportion and the size of Thatcher's estate remains a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-estate-family-secret\">closely guarded secret</a>.</p><h2><strong>State and ceremonial funerals: what's the difference?</strong></h2><p>Procedurally, not much. In both cases, a military procession takes the deceased from their chapel of rest to Westminster Hall, where they lie in state for three days. After lying in state, the procession continues to either Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's Cathedral, where a funeral service is held.</p><p>Ceremonial funerals send off the deceased with a paltry 19-gun salute while state funerals are marked by a 21-gun salute. In a ceremonial funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by horses rather than Royal Navy ratings (specially trained personnel), as is the case for state funerals. Finally, state funerals require a motion or vote from Parliament which isn't needed for a ceremonial funeral.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two is simply who is in the coffin. State funerals are reserved only for monarchy, while ceremonial funerals tend to be reserved for the spouse or family of a monarch but can \"be extended to exceptionally distinguished persons\"<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\"></a>.</p><h2><strong>All That c her</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9980312/Margaret-Thatcher-Dont-waste-money-on-a-flypast-at-my-funeral.html\">Lord Bell</a>, Thatcher did not want to lie in state for the public to pay their respects, and she won't. But the highly visible involvement of military personnel in her funeral will mean that it will resemble a state funeral.</p><h2><strong>Flagging an issue</strong></h2><p>When Buckingham Palace initially refused to fly flags at half-mast following Lady Diana's premature death, the royal family confronted a public outcry the likes of which they hadn't seen in years, and haven't seen since. Yet the decision to fly the flag at half-mast for Thatcher was made almost instantly, despite this being only the third time that this honour was bestowed on an individual not from the royal family.</p><p>You can find a list of famous and infamous state and ceremonial funerals along with details, where possible, on cost.

We've taken a look at the different funeral options available and the potential costs<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Get the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Whether it's £8m or £10m, the estimated costs of Margaret Thatcher's funeral that are being widely reported don't seem to be based on any clear sources. Not here at the Datablog. We take a look at the different types of funeral to bury Britain's <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">'exceptionally distinguished'</a> commoners and consider the costs that might be incurred.</p><h2><strong>Big British funerals</strong></h2><p>If the estimates that are being circulated <em>are</em> correct, the funeral of Margaret Thatcher will be the most expensive in British history. The funeral of Sir Winston Churchill required £2,000 to cover the expenses of fire, police and civil defence services (the equivalent of almost £33,000 in 2012). Though policing costs aren't known, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\">Queen Mother's funeral cost the Ministry of Defence</a> around £301,000 in 2002. </p><p>As well as the large numbers of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/10/margaret-thatcher-funeral-armed-forces\">armed forces already being drawn in</a> to the ceremony, it's likely that given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/police-arrests-thatcher-death-parties\">anti-Thatcher protests</a> have already required riot police, considerable security enforcement will probably be needed. Some of the expense will be covered by the estate of Lady Thatcher, though the government is <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/information-on-arrangements-for-lady-thatchers-funeral/\">not forthcoming</a> on the proportion and the size of Thatcher's estate remains a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/09/margaret-thatcher-estate-family-secret\">closely guarded secret</a>.</p><h2><strong>State and ceremonial funerals: what's the difference?</strong></h2><p>Procedurally, not much. In both cases, a military procession takes the deceased from their chapel of rest to Westminster Hall, where they lie in state for three days. After lying in state, the procession continues to either Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's Cathedral, where a funeral service is held.</p><p>Ceremonial funerals send off the deceased with a paltry 19-gun salute while state funerals are marked by a 21-gun salute. In a ceremonial funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by horses rather than Royal Navy ratings (specially trained personnel), as is the case for state funerals. Finally, state funerals require a motion or vote from Parliament which isn't needed for a ceremonial funeral.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two is simply who is in the coffin. State funerals are reserved only for monarchy, while ceremonial funerals tend to be reserved for the spouse or family of a monarch but can \"be extended to exceptionally distinguished persons\"<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06600\"></a>.</p><h2><strong>All That c her</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/9980312/Margaret-Thatcher-Dont-waste-money-on-a-flypast-at-my-funeral.html\">Lord Bell</a>, Thatcher did not want to lie in state for the public to pay their respects, and she won't. But the highly visible involvement of military personnel in her funeral will mean that it will resemble a state funeral.</p><h2><strong>Flagging an issue</strong></h2><p>When Buckingham Palace initially refused to fly flags at half-mast following Lady Diana's premature death, the royal family confronted a public outcry the likes of which they hadn't seen in years, and haven't seen since. Yet the decision to fly the flag at half-mast for Thatcher was made almost instantly, despite this being only the third time that this honour was bestowed on an individual not from the royal family.</p><p>You can find a list of famous and infamous state and ceremonial funerals along with details, where possible, on cost.

From graphics explaining the economy or government spending, to background information on events, to in-depth analysis of huge news events like the UK's riots of 2011, data has been a core component of the Guardian's coverage.</p><p>As important to that approach is sharing the data we find and collect, and how we approach it, to allow it to be built on, analysed and improved by our readers.

The Great British Class Survey has nevertheless had a go. Here, we consider some of the merits and limitations of their research.</p><h2><strong>Class room</strong></h2><p>Education was one of the topics omitted from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22000973\">online class calculator</a> launched today. Despite the huge success of a handful of uneducated entrepreneurs, level of education completed as well as the type of school attended remain huge determinants of social mobility in Britain. For the poorest fifth in society, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-mobility-data-charts#\">46% have mothers with no qualifications at all</a> whereas for the richest it's only 3%.</p><p>And parents remain a powerful predictor of what class you're in and the class you're capable of moving to. From the two most primitive of indicators - how much money you have and how many generations you've had it for - there has been a gradual shift over the years from placing importance on the latter to emphasising the former. Despite this, inter-generational changes in class are still small. In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/public-finance/chapter%205%20gfg%202010.pdf\">link between individual and parental earnings</a> was found to be the strongest in the UK than any other OECD country. Many argue that the British educational system can reproduce and reinforce these trends. A 2012 <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/education-at-a-glance-2012_eag-2012-en\">report</a>, also from the OECD found that British schools were more socially segregated than in any other developed country.</p><p>As well as education, questions about spending habits were omitted from the online class calculator. Though these might not be entirely accurate (individuals who can afford private healthcare may choose to use the NHS all the same) questions about where someone goes on holiday and where they do their supermarket shop might provide clues about their socio-economic status. What's more, asking about savings, annual earnings and home ownership (included in the class calculator) might not provide the full picture of wealth as they omit to ask about debt.</p><h2><strong>Working class</strong></h2><p>The online class calculator does not ask about your own job title. <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/savage.aspx\">Professor Mike Savage</a> from the London School of Economics (LSE), one of the authors of the survey, was reluctant to rely on this in the research claiming that \"our economy and our lifestyles have changed profoundly since these categories were invented so this may no longer hold true.\" However, the online calculator does use professional titles when asking 'which of these people do you know socially?' This in turn, has several problems of its own.</p><p>Knowing someone 'socially' is open to interpretation. A casual acquaintance or a close friend could equally be included under this question. So, the way that a respondent interprets the question may be influenced by their desired outcome. In other words, if a person perceives themselves as a particular class or is hoping for a particular result from the class calculator the way they define their social network may be biased. </p><h2><strong>World class</strong></h2><p>Almost every study measuring social class is of limited use when making comparisons between countries. Whilst going to stately homes may be an indicator of class in Britain, it doesn't mean much in non-Western countries where stately homes don't exist or where religion plays a crucial role in determining social status. Even economic indicators are not without their limitations. For example, asking about home ownership might not prove so helpful in a country such as France which has a long culture of renting.</p><h2><strong>A class of one's own</strong></h2><p>Some have argued that whether you use seven categories or the traditional three, class is not as important in British society as it once was. A report by the think tank Civitas published last year titled '<a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/socialmobilitydelusions2012.pdf\">Social Mobility Delusions</a>' claimed that \"more than half of us are in a different class from the one we were born into\". Just as the subjects chosen and the wording of questions in the online class calculator influenced results, the definition of class can make an enormous impact on a report's findings. Real life can be similarly influenced by hypotheses. The way that someone interprets their own place in British society can affect self-esteem, ambition and achievement.</p><p>Perhaps that's why class is still a crucial tool for those in marketing trying to sell us products or those in politics trying to buy our votes. </p><p>What do you think about the new class categories suggested by the BBC poll?

Here, we consider some of the merits and limitations of their research.</p><h2><strong>Class room</strong></h2><p>Education was one of the topics omitted from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22000973\">online class calculator</a> launched today. Despite the huge success of a handful of uneducated entrepreneurs, level of education completed as well as the type of school attended remain huge determinants of social mobility in Britain. For the poorest fifth in society, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/22/social-mobility-data-charts#\">46% have mothers with no qualifications at all</a> whereas for the richest it's only 3%.</p><p>And parents remain a powerful predictor of what class you're in and the class you're capable of moving to. From the two most primitive of indicators - how much money you have and how many generations you've had it for - there has been a gradual shift over the years from placing importance on the latter to emphasising the former. Despite this, inter-generational changes in class are still small. In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/public-finance/chapter%205%20gfg%202010.pdf\">link between individual and parental earnings</a> was found to be the strongest in the UK than any other OECD country. Many argue that the British educational system can reproduce and reinforce these trends. A 2012 <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/education-at-a-glance-2012_eag-2012-en\">report</a>, also from the OECD found that British schools were more socially segregated than in any other developed country.</p><p>As well as education, questions about spending habits were omitted from the online class calculator. Though these might not be entirely accurate (individuals who can afford private healthcare may choose to use the NHS all the same) questions about where someone goes on holiday and where they do their supermarket shop might provide clues about their socio-economic status. What's more, asking about savings, annual earnings and home ownership (included in the class calculator) might not provide the full picture of wealth as they omit to ask about debt.</p><h2><strong>Working class</strong></h2><p>The online class calculator does not ask about your own job title. <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/savage.aspx\">Professor Mike Savage</a> from the London School of Economics (LSE), one of the authors of the survey, was reluctant to rely on this in the research claiming that \"our economy and our lifestyles have changed profoundly since these categories were invented so this may no longer hold true.\" However, the online calculator does use professional titles when asking 'which of these people do you know socially?' This in turn, has several problems of its own.</p><p>Knowing someone 'socially' is open to interpretation. A casual acquaintance or a close friend could equally be included under this question. So, the way that a respondent interprets the question may be influenced by their desired outcome. In other words, if a person perceives themselves as a particular class or is hoping for a particular result from the class calculator the way they define their social network may be biased. </p><h2><strong>World class</strong></h2><p>Almost every study measuring social class is of limited use when making comparisons between countries. Whilst going to stately homes may be an indicator of class in Britain, it doesn't mean much in non-Western countries where stately homes don't exist or where religion plays a crucial role in determining social status. Even economic indicators are not without their limitations. For example, asking about home ownership might not prove so helpful in a country such as France which has a long culture of renting.</p><h2><strong>A class of one's own</strong></h2><p>Some have argued that whether you use seven categories or the traditional three, class is not as important in British society as it once was. A report by the think tank Civitas published last year titled '<a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/socialmobilitydelusions2012.pdf\">Social Mobility Delusions</a>' claimed that \"more than half of us are in a different class from the one we were born into\". Just as the subjects chosen and the wording of questions in the online class calculator influenced results, the definition of class can make an enormous impact on a report's findings. Real life can be similarly influenced by hypotheses. The way that someone interprets their own place in British society can affect self-esteem, ambition and achievement.</p><p>Perhaps that's why class is still a crucial tool for those in marketing trying to sell us products or those in politics trying to buy our votes. </p><p>What do you think about the new class categories suggested by the BBC poll?

East London, which received the lowest score in 2012, again had the fewest respondents reporting happiness in 2013. </p><p><strong>How do you define happiness?</strong></p><p>Rightmove's <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/files/2013/03/Rightmove-Happy-At-Home-Index-2013.pdf\">approach</a> was to ask people in 110 UK towns to what extent they agreed with 12 statements ranging from 'I often feel unsafe in the community in which I live' to 'I do not worry about the value of my property'. </p><p>But not all of the statements in the survey necessarily reflect upon towns. For example, the first statement 'on the whole, the décor and furnishings in my home are to my liking' might be more indicative of the socio-economic background of the individual completing the survey, than of the town under scrutiny. As it turns out, Cleveland in the North East comes top for residents satisfaction with their own décor, but ranks 64th overall in the index. </p><p>Similarly, a negative response to the statement 'generally, I feel relaxed when I am at home' may say more about family life than the town in which the respondent lives. Here again, the correlation between this response and the overall results is relatively weak. </p><p>Harrogate which comes first overall, ranks in 79th place for residents feeling relaxed at home. It is also not clear whether the 40,000 respondents were drawn in equal measure for the 110 towns included in the survey. Clearly, if five people were asked their views on Stockport (2nd place) and 1,000 people were asked about their homes in Croydon (109th place), the findings would be highly skewed. </p><p>There was however a strong correlation between responses on 'neighbourliness' (captured by Rightmove in the statement 'I enjoy spending time in the area in which I live') and a town's overall score.

Between the years 2011 and 2012, GDP in volume terms increased by 0.3%<br />• The households' saving ratio was estimated to be 7.1% in 2012, the highest since the 1997 estimate of 8.1%<br />• Real household disposable income increased by 2.1% between 2011 and 2012.

What do the numbers show us about how busy these MPs are?<br /><br />• <a href=\"#data\">Download the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Ministers in the UK government are considering whether to take action on one of the most sensitive and potentially contentious issues at Westminster: limiting the rights of MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to vote and decide on \"England only\" legislation.</p><p>But that in turn raises an equally thorny issue: if non-English MPs are to have a more restricted role in the Commons, are as many needed? Are they as busy as they once were? Scottish Tories are privately suggesting the numbers of Scottish MPs might need to be cut: a move which would most likely reduce the number of Labour MPs at Westminster the most.</p><p>There was evidence in the earlier years of devolution that MPs from other parts of the UK were often much less busy, but a new Guardian survey suggests that is no longer true: Scottish and Welsh MPs in particular are amongst the busiest at Westminster – particularly the Scottish National party. Compared to the early years of devolution, when MPs had not yet adjusted, today's non-England MPs are highly active.</p><p>It is a debate best known as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/17/what-is-west-lothian-question\">West Lothian question</a> – posed in 1977 by the then Labour MP for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell. </p><p>A critic of devolution of Westminster's law-making powers to the proposed Scottish assembly, Dalyell conundrum was this: why, under devolution, Scottish MPs could still vote on English policies while English MPs could not vote on devolved Scottish affairs?</p><p>Variants of this question have been around since the late 1800s, tied then to proposals for Irish home rule. But, after 14 years of devolution of wide-ranging and increasing powers to the Scottish and Welsh legislatures, and the successful reformation of Northern Ireland's powerful assembly, that question is still very live.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/report-of-the-commission-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons/\">McKay Commission inquiry</a> set up by UK ministers stated that an answer to the West Lothian question was needed, to ensure the Commons better reflected the specific interests of England, given that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have domestic legislatures controlling large areas of policy and law-making.</p><p>While it rejected cutting the number of non-England MPs on principle, as that would undermine Westminster's role as the ultimate law-making body for the UK, it recommended that new measures and policies were put in place to ensure that in future, England-only bills were framed by only MPs from English seats. They would not have a veto to overrule the whole parliament, but the basic principle ought to be \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/25/english-only-votes-legislation-commission\">English votes for English laws</a>\".</p><p>McKay stated: \"The status quo clearly cannot be sustained. Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail. We expect that governments will prefer compromise to conflict.\"</p><p>The Guardian survey has used three core activities in the Commons to compare how active MPs from the different nations are: voting, participating in debates and placing written parliamentary questions.</p><p>These three tests – the most visible of activities – have given us a snapshot picture of how busy MPs from the different parts of the UK have been at Westminster. We used data from <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">theyworkforyou.com</a> on how many questions they asked and debates they spoke in for the year from 1 February 2012, and figures from <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/\">publicwhip.org.uk</a> for every vote since the 2010 general election.</p><p>It was designed to test how devolution of often significant legal and policy-making powers to the three devolved legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast has reduced or changed the workload and work rate of MPs from those nations and regions.</p><p>The Guardian's study has found Scottish and Welsh MPs are often as active as their English counterparts – in some case more so. The results for Northern Ireland are more complicated: its five Sinn Fein MPs as supporters of a reunited Ireland, do not take up their seats on principle. Even so, the performance of Northern Irish MPs is very mixed.</p><p>Our survey, which captured every vote in since the 2010 election and all debates and parliament questions for the last year, gives a snapshot comparison of how national groups of MPs behave. It has found that:</p><blockquote><p>1. Scottish MPs voted on average in 65% of all votes, and Welsh MPs in 73%, compared to 75% of votes by English MPs on average. This is narrower gap than 10 years ago, perhaps reflecting the significance of UK-wide policies such as welfare, the economy, and defence, and the much tighter political balance in the Commons, which means votes can be closer.</p><p>2. The six Scottish National party MPs, who have a largely observed policy not to vote on bills which have no direct impact on Scotland, only took part in 47.6% of votes.</p><p>3. Northern Irish MPs, even excluding the five abstentionist Sinn Fein MPs who refuse on principle to take their seats at Westminster, only took part in 45% of all votes compared to 76% by English MPs or 65% by Scottish MPs.</p><p>This could reflect Stormont's far greater degree of control over domestic policy in Northern Ireland, which includes welfare and pensions. Even so, they spoke in 57 debates last year on average, against 37 for English MPs.</p><p>4. SNP, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs were – on average – more likely to speak in parliamentary debates last year: SNP MPs took part in 44 debates on average, against an average of 37 debates for English MPs. Welsh MPs spoke in 43.7 debates. But Northern Irish MPs spoke the most: excluding the four Sinn Fein abstainers, they took part in 57 debates each on average.</p><p>5. And SNP MPs – now repeatedly probing the UK government over independence-related issues – were, as a group, again top of the chart for asking parliamentary questions.</p><p>On average, the six SNP MPs asked 131 questions last year, because Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader and defence spokesman, tabled 345 Pqs, with Mike Weir putting down 174 and Eilidh Whiteford 113. This average was nearly double the Scottish average of just under 70 questions and well above the English average of 55 PQ.s</p><p>6. Welsh MPs were also very active with parliamentary questions: they averaged 76.5 each in the year from February 2012 and 2013.</p><p>7. Some of the overall totals are skewed by extremely active individual MPs. For example, the Scottish MP Tom Greatrex, a shadow Labour energy minister, asked 515 PQ.s, while the Welsh Labour backbencher Chris Ruane asked 601 PQ.s – the record in our snapshot survey.</p><p>By comparison, the median or midpoint number for Pqs tabled by Scottish MPs is 34 and 32 for Welsh MPs, against 30 for English MPs.</p></blockquote><p>The West Lothian question leapt to life several times under Tony Blair's Labour government: some Tory MPs, including senior figures such as former leader William Hague, Ken Clarke and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, argue it is wrong for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs to have undue control over bills and policies only affecting England.</p><p>The McKay inquiry stated that \"the political resonance of the West Lothian question is at its greatest\" when a UK government uses MPs from outside England to control the Commons, to outvote English opposition MPs.</p><p>The commission said these occasions are very rare: it has not happened in the post-devolution era and previously only between 1964 and 66, and briefly in early 1974, when England returned a Tory majority and Labour needed Scottish and Welsh backbenchers to force through legislation.</p><p>The commission did not mention that in 1965, Ulster unionist MPs allied with the Tory opposition to vote down Harold Wilson's plan to nationalise the steel industry: he was furious, as there was no steel industry in Northern Ireland.</p><p>There is a second scenario: where a government in power has used MPs from non-English seats to overcome a rebellion by its own backbenchers on English or English and Welsh legislation.</p><p>This happened twice for Labour since devolution situation, over foundation hospitals and tuition fees, when Scottish backbenchers voted en masse in favour of English and Welsh measures opposed by many English Labour MPs, saving Tony Blair's bills.</p><p>In parallel with these debates, researchers with University College London's constitution unit and think tanks found evidence that Scottish MPs caught up in the immediate post-devolution period were less busy but also often behaved as if devolution had not occurred.</p><p>Guy Lodge, a leading devolution analyst now with the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Oonagh Gay, found that Scottish MPs took part in fewer votes between 1999 and 2001. Lodge did a further study which found that in 2002-03, Scottish MPs were still putting questions to ministers with much less or no direct relevance to Scottish affairs, including the Home Office, transport and culture.</p><p>A study by Akash Paun, published in the constitution unit's \"The State of the Nations 2008\", found that in 2006 English Labour backbenchers spent far more on postage than their Scottish and Welsh counterparts: £4,137 versus £2,866 by Scottish backbenchers and £2,773 by Welsh. (The overall differential was lower: £3,633 on average for all English MPs versus £2,885 for Scottish MPs and £2,555 for Welsh.)</p><p>Paun also found that in 2004 English MPs did an average of 31.8 hours on constituency and local work, versus 24.4hrs by Scottish MPs and 27.6 by Welsh.</p><p>Compared to MPs moulded in the pre-devolution era when the Commons controlled all the UK's policies, devolution analysts such as Alan Trench and senior figures in the UK parties believe that MPs from devolved areas have adapted. They now have a better understanding of how to make Westminster work for them, when half their constituency work was gone.</p><p>The latest generation of MPs, particularly those newly elected in May 2010, are said to be more aware of the significant role they can play in the Commons on reserved powers, like the economy, welfare, trade and defence. Their constituency workload is much reduced: so they switch to UK level politics and policy.</p><p>(Welsh MPs do have more reserved powers to work on: the Home Office in London, for instance, still controls policing and courts in Wales. It does not do so in Scotland.)</p><p>But perhaps more significantly, Scottish and Welsh MPs are more active and visible in the Commons because the Tories are in power. As Scotland and Wales tend to elect proportionately more Labour MPs and have strong nationalist parties, so the Commons becomes their main battleground. Likewise, when the Tories were in opposition, the power and influence of non-England MPs at Westminster was a source of irritation and grievance.</p><p>In 2010, Scotland elected 41 Labour MPs out of 59, while Wales returned 26 Labour MPs out of 41. When Labour was in government these backbenchers were able to influence policy and get things done through direct contact with ministers. Any questions could be raised with a letter or a quiet word.</p><p>With Labour now in opposition: using parliamentary questions and debates is the main method for challenging the government. Envigorated by Alex Salmond's control of the Scottish parliament and next year's independence referendum, the SNP's six MPs are also very active, as this survey has shown.</p><p>If Alex Salmond's Scottish National party and the pro-independence movement loses the referendum on 18 September 2014, devolution of powers to Holyrood is expected to accelerate, which could in turn raise fresh questions about the role and number of non-English MPs in the Commons. If Salmond wins, this question is moot for Scotland: the SNP will have decisively answered the West Lothian question. For Wales, however, an independent Scotland could accelerate devolution to Cardiff.</p><p>After 2015, Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are all considering an increase in Scotland's tax-raising and borrowing powers, and is studying devolving control over parts of welfare and social security. Under the Scotland Act 2012, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/mar/21/scotland-power-set-income-tax-2016\">2016 Scotland will already set its own income tax rate</a>, raising £5.6bn worth of its own spending.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson joined with senior Scottish Labour and Lib Dem figures by agreeing that Holyrood could get even greater tax powers after 2015.</p><p>Several influential think tanks, including Reform Scotland which has members from all three main UK parties, and the Institute for Public Policy Research, are pushing for greater Scottish control over tax and welfare.</p><p>In Wales, all the parties – including senior figures in the Tory party – are debating seeking more legislative powers, including control over policing, currently reserved to Westminster, and their first powers over tax-raising. The Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont (the UK's longest running devolved legislature) already has wide-ranging, substantial autonomy, but has been pressing for control over corporation tax.</p><p>Observers and insiders alike believe the UK government will delay any action on implementing McKay's recommendations until after next year's Scottish referendum. But that will take Westminster so close to the 2015 general election, the pace and intensity of devolution will speed up. If it does, the West Lothian question and McKay's solution are likely to become more pressing.</p><p><em>Notes: This study is designed to provide a snapshot of MPs' performance, by collecting total figures for MPs from all four parts of the UK.

What do the numbers show us about how busy these MPs are?<br /><br />• <a href=\"#data\">Download the data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><p>Ministers in the UK government are considering whether to take action on one of the most sensitive and potentially contentious issues at Westminster: limiting the rights of MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to vote and decide on \"England only\" legislation.</p><p>But that in turn raises an equally thorny issue: if non-English MPs are to have a more restricted role in the Commons, are as many needed? Are they as busy as they once were? Scottish Tories are privately suggesting the numbers of Scottish MPs might need to be cut: a move which would most likely reduce the number of Labour MPs at Westminster the most.</p><p>There was evidence in the earlier years of devolution that MPs from other parts of the UK were often much less busy, but a new Guardian survey suggests that is no longer true: Scottish and Welsh MPs in particular are amongst the busiest at Westminster – particularly the Scottish National party. Compared to the early years of devolution, when MPs had not yet adjusted, today's non-England MPs are highly active.</p><p>It is a debate best known as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jan/17/what-is-west-lothian-question\">West Lothian question</a> – posed in 1977 by the then Labour MP for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell. </p><p>A critic of devolution of Westminster's law-making powers to the proposed Scottish assembly, Dalyell conundrum was this: why, under devolution, Scottish MPs could still vote on English policies while English MPs could not vote on devolved Scottish affairs?</p><p>Variants of this question have been around since the late 1800s, tied then to proposals for Irish home rule. But, after 14 years of devolution of wide-ranging and increasing powers to the Scottish and Welsh legislatures, and the successful reformation of Northern Ireland's powerful assembly, that question is still very live.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/report-of-the-commission-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons/\">McKay Commission inquiry</a> set up by UK ministers stated that an answer to the West Lothian question was needed, to ensure the Commons better reflected the specific interests of England, given that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have domestic legislatures controlling large areas of policy and law-making.</p><p>While it rejected cutting the number of non-England MPs on principle, as that would undermine Westminster's role as the ultimate law-making body for the UK, it recommended that new measures and policies were put in place to ensure that in future, England-only bills were framed by only MPs from English seats. They would not have a veto to overrule the whole parliament, but the basic principle ought to be \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/25/english-only-votes-legislation-commission\">English votes for English laws</a>\".</p><p>McKay stated: \"The status quo clearly cannot be sustained. Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail. We expect that governments will prefer compromise to conflict.\"</p><p>The Guardian survey has used three core activities in the Commons to compare how active MPs from the different nations are: voting, participating in debates and placing written parliamentary questions.</p><p>These three tests – the most visible of activities – have given us a snapshot picture of how busy MPs from the different parts of the UK have been at Westminster. We used data from <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">theyworkforyou.com</a> on how many questions they asked and debates they spoke in for the year from 1 February 2012, and figures from <a href=\"http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/\">publicwhip.org.uk</a> for every vote since the 2010 general election.</p><p>It was designed to test how devolution of often significant legal and policy-making powers to the three devolved legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast has reduced or changed the workload and work rate of MPs from those nations and regions.</p><p>The Guardian's study has found Scottish and Welsh MPs are often as active as their English counterparts – in some case more so. The results for Northern Ireland are more complicated: its five Sinn Fein MPs as supporters of a reunited Ireland, do not take up their seats on principle. Even so, the performance of Northern Irish MPs is very mixed.</p><p>Our survey, which captured every vote in since the 2010 election and all debates and parliament questions for the last year, gives a snapshot comparison of how national groups of MPs behave. It has found that:</p><blockquote><p>1. Scottish MPs voted on average in 65% of all votes, and Welsh MPs in 73%, compared to 75% of votes by English MPs on average. This is narrower gap than 10 years ago, perhaps reflecting the significance of UK-wide policies such as welfare, the economy, and defence, and the much tighter political balance in the Commons, which means votes can be closer.</p><p>2. The six Scottish National party MPs, who have a largely observed policy not to vote on bills which have no direct impact on Scotland, only took part in 47.6% of votes.</p><p>3. Northern Irish MPs, even excluding the five abstentionist Sinn Fein MPs who refuse on principle to take their seats at Westminster, only took part in 45% of all votes compared to 76% by English MPs or 65% by Scottish MPs.</p><p>This could reflect Stormont's far greater degree of control over domestic policy in Northern Ireland, which includes welfare and pensions. Even so, they spoke in 57 debates last year on average, against 37 for English MPs.</p><p>4. SNP, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs were – on average – more likely to speak in parliamentary debates last year: SNP MPs took part in 44 debates on average, against an average of 37 debates for English MPs. Welsh MPs spoke in 43.7 debates. But Northern Irish MPs spoke the most: excluding the four Sinn Fein abstainers, they took part in 57 debates each on average.</p><p>5. And SNP MPs – now repeatedly probing the UK government over independence-related issues – were, as a group, again top of the chart for asking parliamentary questions.</p><p>On average, the six SNP MPs asked 131 questions last year, because Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader and defence spokesman, tabled 345 Pqs, with Mike Weir putting down 174 and Eilidh Whiteford 113. This average was nearly double the Scottish average of just under 70 questions and well above the English average of 55 PQ.s</p><p>6. Welsh MPs were also very active with parliamentary questions: they averaged 76.5 each in the year from February 2012 and 2013.</p><p>7. Some of the overall totals are skewed by extremely active individual MPs. For example, the Scottish MP Tom Greatrex, a shadow Labour energy minister, asked 515 PQ.s, while the Welsh Labour backbencher Chris Ruane asked 601 PQ.s – the record in our snapshot survey.</p><p>By comparison, the median or midpoint number for Pqs tabled by Scottish MPs is 34 and 32 for Welsh MPs, against 30 for English MPs.</p></blockquote><p>The West Lothian question leapt to life several times under Tony Blair's Labour government: some Tory MPs, including senior figures such as former leader William Hague, Ken Clarke and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, argue it is wrong for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs to have undue control over bills and policies only affecting England.</p><p>The McKay inquiry stated that \"the political resonance of the West Lothian question is at its greatest\" when a UK government uses MPs from outside England to control the Commons, to outvote English opposition MPs.</p><p>The commission said these occasions are very rare: it has not happened in the post-devolution era and previously only between 1964 and 66, and briefly in early 1974, when England returned a Tory majority and Labour needed Scottish and Welsh backbenchers to force through legislation.</p><p>The commission did not mention that in 1965, Ulster unionist MPs allied with the Tory opposition to vote down Harold Wilson's plan to nationalise the steel industry: he was furious, as there was no steel industry in Northern Ireland.</p><p>There is a second scenario: where a government in power has used MPs from non-English seats to overcome a rebellion by its own backbenchers on English or English and Welsh legislation.</p><p>This happened twice for Labour since devolution situation, over foundation hospitals and tuition fees, when Scottish backbenchers voted en masse in favour of English and Welsh measures opposed by many English Labour MPs, saving Tony Blair's bills.</p><p>In parallel with these debates, researchers with University College London's constitution unit and think tanks found evidence that Scottish MPs caught up in the immediate post-devolution period were less busy but also often behaved as if devolution had not occurred.</p><p>Guy Lodge, a leading devolution analyst now with the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Oonagh Gay, found that Scottish MPs took part in fewer votes between 1999 and 2001. Lodge did a further study which found that in 2002-03, Scottish MPs were still putting questions to ministers with much less or no direct relevance to Scottish affairs, including the Home Office, transport and culture.</p><p>A study by Akash Paun, published in the constitution unit's \"The State of the Nations 2008\", found that in 2006 English Labour backbenchers spent far more on postage than their Scottish and Welsh counterparts: £4,137 versus £2,866 by Scottish backbenchers and £2,773 by Welsh. (The overall differential was lower: £3,633 on average for all English MPs versus £2,885 for Scottish MPs and £2,555 for Welsh.)</p><p>Paun also found that in 2004 English MPs did an average of 31.8 hours on constituency and local work, versus 24.4hrs by Scottish MPs and 27.6 by Welsh.</p><p>Compared to MPs moulded in the pre-devolution era when the Commons controlled all the UK's policies, devolution analysts such as Alan Trench and senior figures in the UK parties believe that MPs from devolved areas have adapted. They now have a better understanding of how to make Westminster work for them, when half their constituency work was gone.</p><p>The latest generation of MPs, particularly those newly elected in May 2010, are said to be more aware of the significant role they can play in the Commons on reserved powers, like the economy, welfare, trade and defence. Their constituency workload is much reduced: so they switch to UK level politics and policy.</p><p>(Welsh MPs do have more reserved powers to work on: the Home Office in London, for instance, still controls policing and courts in Wales. It does not do so in Scotland.)</p><p>But perhaps more significantly, Scottish and Welsh MPs are more active and visible in the Commons because the Tories are in power. As Scotland and Wales tend to elect proportionately more Labour MPs and have strong nationalist parties, so the Commons becomes their main battleground. Likewise, when the Tories were in opposition, the power and influence of non-England MPs at Westminster was a source of irritation and grievance.</p><p>In 2010, Scotland elected 41 Labour MPs out of 59, while Wales returned 26 Labour MPs out of 41. When Labour was in government these backbenchers were able to influence policy and get things done through direct contact with ministers. Any questions could be raised with a letter or a quiet word.</p><p>With Labour now in opposition: using parliamentary questions and debates is the main method for challenging the government.

If Salmond wins, this question is moot for Scotland: the SNP will have decisively answered the West Lothian question.

We bring you all the data going back to the 1940s<br />• <a href=\"#data\">Get the data</a></p><p>How bad is Britain's deficit? The latest set of figures show that Britain's public finances showed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/21/uk-government-borrowing-ons-psnb-4g\">a much smaller than expected deficit</a> in February.</p><p>The<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/february-2013/stb---february-2013.html\"> Office for National Statistics said</a> the public sector current budget deficit was £1.1bn in February - this is a £7.1bn lower deficit than the same time last year.</p><p>The Guardian writes today: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>February's figures are flattered by a known £2.6bn transfer of cash from the Bank of England under a deal to return gilt interest to the government, and £2.3bn from the sale of next-generation mobile phone frequencies.</p><p>But underlying performance was also strong, with a drop in local government spending and stronger central government tax receipts.</p><p>Since the start of the tax year in April 2012, borrowing has totalled £94.9bn, excluding a one-off boost from the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets. This is 8.9% lower than at the same point in the 2011-12 tax year, and with one month left of the fiscal year, Osborne is in a strong position to meet his new full-year goal of borrowing no more than £114.5bn – just over 7% of GDP.</p></blockquote><h2>UK public debt</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>We have the complete set of data on Government borrowing, all the way back to the 1940s. All political parties have faced their fair share of debt through the years - almost as if the economic climate has its own life independent of who is managing it. </p><p>What is the deficit? When the ONS talks about the deficit, they take a simple measure - the gap between what's coming into the government in taxes and receipts versus what's being spent. Most commentators look at net borrowing as the deficit figure, because it includes investment spending. It's different to the national debt - which is the total the country owes.</p><p>So last month the budget was in deficit. Here are the key facts for November - if you exclude the temporary effects of the financial interventions in the banks:</p><blockquote><p>• Public sector net borrowing was £2.8bn in February 2013; this is a £9bn lower net borrowing than in February 2012, when net borrowing was £11.8bn.<br />• Public sector current budget deficit was £1.1bn in February 2013; this is a £7.1bn lower deficit than in February 2012, when there was a deficit of £8.1bn.<br />• For the period April 2012 to February 2013, public sector net borrowing (excluding the effects of the Royal Mail Pension Plan transfer in April 2012 and the transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility) was £101.3bn; this is £2.9bn lower net borrowing than in the same period the previous year, when net borrowing was £104.2bn.<br />• February 2013 public sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) was reduced by £2.7bn as a result of cash transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund to Government and by £2.3bn as a result of proceeds from the 4G spectrum auction.<br />• Public sector net debt was £1,161.5bn at the end of February 2013, equivalent to 73.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).<br />• In 2012/13, public sector net borrowing and public sector current budget deficit are reduced by £6.4bn as a result of cash transfers from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund to Government.<br />• In 2012/13, public sector net borrowing and public sector net investment are reduced by £28bn as a result of the transfer of the Royal Mail Pension Plan in April 2012.<br /> </p></blockquote><p>The ONS <a href=\"#data\">data below</a> shows monthly, quarterly and annual debt and deficit - what can you do with it?</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a><br />• <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdEdNdWlxdGhJVHE1WE9OYlVQazZUcWc&hl=en\">DATA: download the full list as a spreadsheet</a></p><h2>More data</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p>• <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/general-election-2010\">General election 2010</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy\">Economic policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth\">Economic growth (GDP)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending\">Tax and spending</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance\">Public finance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/government-borrowing\">Government borrowing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition\">Liberal-Conservative coalition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/spending-review\">Spending review 2010</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliakollewe\">Julia Kollewe</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simonrogers\">Simon Rogers</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But with a total of 37,000 runners, the London Marathon is only the sixth biggest 26.2-mile race in the world. </p><p>The biggest by far is in New York, where a world record was set when 46,759 people completed the New York City Marathon in 2011.
