In some EU countries, land ownership is as unequal as it is in Brazil, Colombia and the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Although peasant farmers and smallholders have been moving off the land for decades, speculators and commodity crop farmers are taking over vast tracts of land, says the 200-page report.</p><p></p><p>This is seen widely in former Soviet states, say the 25 authors in 11 countries. In Ukraine, 10 giant agro-holdings now control about 2.8m hectares. One oligarch alone controls more than 500,000 hectares. Chinese companies have moved into Bulgaria on a large scale and Middle Eastern companies are now major producers in Romania.</p><p></p><p>The concentration of land ownership is speeding up. In Germany, 1.2m land holdings in 1966-67 shrank to just 299,100 farms by 2010. Of these, the land area covered by farms of less than two hectares shrank from 123,670 hectares in 1990 to just 20,110 in 2007.</p><p></p><p>In Italy, 33,000 farms now cover 11m hectares, and in France more than 60,000 hectares of agricultural land are lost each year to make space for roads, supermarkets and urban growth. In Andalusia, Spain, the number of farms has dropped by more than two-thirds to under 1m in 2007. In 2010, 2% of landowners owned half of the land.</p><p></p><p>None of the new research was done in Britain, which has some of the highest concentrations of land ownership anywhere in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.who-owns-britain.com/\" title=\"\">70% of land reportedly owned by less than 1% of the population</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"This is an unprecedented dynamic of land concentration and creeping land grabbing. It has worsened the existing situation where many young people want to stay in or take up farming but cannot maintain or gain access to land,\" said Professor Dr Jan Douwe van der Ploeg of Wageningen University, a member of the research team.</p><p></p><p>The authors argue that the \"land grab\" has been fuelled by the common agricultural policy (CAP), which distributes one-third of all EU subsidies to farmers each year, but the funds have been captured by large-scale farmers.</p><p></p><p>\"In Italy in 2011, 0.29% of farms accessed 18% of total CAP incentives, and 0.0001 of these, or 150 farms, cornered 6% of all subsidies. In Spain, 75% of all the subsidies were taken by just 16% of the largest farmers. In Hungary in 2009, 8.6% of farms cornered 72% of all agricultural subsidies,\" said Van der Ploeg.</p><p></p><p>\"The three most pressing land issues in Europe today are land concentration, land grabbing and inability of young people to maintain or gain access to land to enter sustainable farming – interlinked, triangular land issues quite similar to the ones we see in Africa, Latin America and Asia today.\"</p><p></p><p>The report suggests that, as in many developing countries, there is strong opposition to land \"grabbing\" in Europe. There have been reports of communities occupying land. In Andalusia, landless farmers are occupying land collectively and cultivating it. In Vienna, young people are squatting on fertile urban land.</p><p></p><p>\"Land needs to be seen again as a public good. We must reduce the commodification of land and instead promote public management of this common resource on which we all depend,\" said Jeanne Verlinden of the European Co-ordination Via Campesina. \"Priority should be given to the use of land for smallholder and peasant agriculture and food production, rather than handing over land to those private property commercial interests.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/international-land-deals\">International land deals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/land-rights\">Land rights</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnvidal\">John Vidal</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But experts have warned that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/world/africa/as-coal-boosts-mozambique-the-rural-poor-are-left-behind.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\" title=\"\">economic growth is no guarantee of poverty alleviation</a>.</p><p></p><p>A separate <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/africaspulse\" title=\"\">report by the World Bank</a> predicted that sub-Saharan Africa's expansion would be 4.9%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, again comfortably outstripping the global average. Increased investment, high commodity prices and a recovery in the world economy are likely to sustain the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august\" title=\"\">narrative of \"Africa rising\"</a>, the bank said.</p><p></p><p>Foreign direct investment inflows to sub-Saharan Africa are projected to increase to record levels each year over the next three years, reaching $54bn (£35bn) by 2015. This compares with $37.7bn last year.</p><p></p><p>The report said a decade of strong growth had reduced poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, with provisional data showing that between 1996 and 2010, the percentage of Africans living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 58% to 48.5%.</p><p></p><p>The mineral sectors in countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone should continue to attract investment.</p><p></p><p>But World Bank economists cautioned that high inequality and a dependence on mining and mineral exports in many countries had actually dampened the poverty-reducing effect of income growth. Countries rich in natural resources, such as Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria, performed less well than those lacking this apparent head start.</p><p></p><p>Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, said: \"While the broad picture emerging from the data is that Africa's economies have been expanding robustly and that poverty is coming down, the aggregate hides a great deal of diversity in performance, even among Africa's faster growers.\"</p><p></p><p>The World Bank said better administration of mineral wealth, development of agriculture and a careful managing of rapid urbanisation would help governments to lift more people out of poverty. \"Better governance will need to underpin efforts to make growth more poverty reducing,\" the report said.</p><p></p><p>Infrastructure development was vital to ensure the strong pace of economic growth, for example in east Africa's oil and gas sectors, it said. A <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/uk-mozambique-infrastructure-idUKBRE93F0R020130416\" title=\"\">report by Reuters</a> this week highlighted how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/apr/13/mozambique-mining-hiv-infection-rate\" title=\"\">coal mining in Mozambique</a> has been hit by weak railways and ports.</p><p></p><p>Africa's golden decade can be matched closely to China's soaring demand for commodities; Chinese demand accounts for half of many industrial metals exported from Africa.

The report says urbanisation provides higher incomes than workers would earn on a farm and yields further opportunities to climb the income ladder.</p><p>\"Virtually no country has graduated to a high-income status without urbanising and urbanisation rates above 70% are typically found in high-income countries,\" said the report, which noted that urban poverty rates were relatively low and declining in all regions between 1990 and 2008.</p><p>\"Governments should not be afraid of urbanisation,\" said Jos Verbeek, lead author of the report. \"If managed well, it can be a force for good.\"</p><p>In addition to creating better-paid jobs, cities allow better and cheaper access to services. In Niger, for example, the average price of water is 182 West African CFA francs (£0.24) per cubic metre for piped water from a network, CFAF 534 from a public fountain and CFAF 926 from a vendor in rural areas. Poor access to basic infrastructure has a disproportionate effect on rural women as they perform most of the domestic chores and often walk long distances to fetch water.</p><p>About 2.7 billion people in the developing world live in urban areas and 96% of the additional 1.4 billion people in the developing world by 2030 will live in cities. Growth will not only be in today's megacities of Shanghai or Mumbai, but also in secondary cities such as Huambo in Angola, Fushun in China and Surat in India.</p><p>The report says many emerging urban centres are still taking shape, providing policymakers with a unique but rapidly closing window of opportunity to get their cities \"right\".</p><h2>Slum warning</h2><p>\"If the forces of urbanisation are not managed speedily and efficiently, slum growth can overwhelm city growth, exacerbate urban poverty, derail MDG achievements and reduce, if not eliminate, cities' comparative advantage regarding attainment of the MDGs,\" the report warned.</p><p>About 1 billion people live in urban slums in poor countries and their numbers are projected to grow by nearly 500 million by 2020. These populations are growing fastest in sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia and western Asia. 62% of Africa's urban population live in slums.</p><p>\"Slums are the result of an unfettered approach to urbanisation,\" said Hans Timmer, director of the World Bank team that produced the report. \"If you plan right, you would not see the emergence of slums.\"</p><p>A key message of the report is that governments should provide basic services for people in slums, just like in rural areas or cities. In Laos, for example, the government has given squatters long-term leases to public land, formalising their status on the land they already occupied. In Vinh, the Vietnamese government is trying to provide slums with better services by adjusting planning standards to make them more realistic and cheaper.</p><p>The report emphasises the importance of planning; making markets (labour, goods and services) accessible to other neighbourhoods in the city, other cities and export markets; and financing for large infrastructure projects.</p><p>\"Of the three, planning for land use and basic services is the most important,\" said the report. \"The challenges for countries at all stages of urbanisation is strengthening institutions for land management … Financing should be city leaders' last concern rather than their first.\"</p><p>Timmer said planning should ensure big cities are connected to small cities and rural areas. \"Small cities are very important for rural areas as farmers can get better prices,\" he said. \"There must be an emphasis on connectivity and you can't leave all the planning to municipalities as they all compete with each other. You do need some kind of master plan to focus on exchanges between rural areas and small cities.\"</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa's poor people are concentrated in rural areas and cannot migrate at once to urban areas, so any strategy to achieve the MDGs should include increasing rural productivity through the introduction of technology and investment in the health and education of villagers, said the report.</p><h2>Mixed news on MDGs</h2><p>Only four of the 21 MDG targets or sub-targets have been met worldwide, two years before the 2015 deadline. New estimates confirm that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-one-poverty-hunger\" title=\"\">MDG1.a</a> on reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, on less than $1.25 a day, was reached in 2010.</p><p>The world has also met <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-environmental-sustainability\" title=\"\">MDG7.c</a>, to halve the proportion of people without access to drinking water. MDG7.d – to significantly improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 – was achieved, and the elimination of gender disparity in primary education (part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-gender-equality\" title=\"\">MDG3.a</a>) was reached in 2010.</p><p>However, progress on the remaining MDGs has been less than \"stellar\", particularly on education and health. \"A vast acceleration is needed to achieve all the goals by 2015,\" said the report.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/cities-and-development\">Cities and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/millennium-development-goals\">Millennium development goals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/urbanisation\">Urbanisation</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank\">World Bank</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktran\">Mark Tran</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He told the local press that the government would identify all those schools that fail to meet standards and close them to stop the exploitation of children.</p><p></p><p>In the coming months, the Senegalese government is expected to unveil an ambitious plan that will regulate the Qur'anic schools, known as <em>daaras</em>, and put an end to children begging on the streets by the end of next year.</p><p></p><p>\"The plan hopes to rejuvenate a law drafted in 2007 that regulates the daaras<em> </em>by introducing operating norms and standards, as well as evaluating and identifying daaras<em> </em>that need to be shut down,\" said Amsatou Sow Sidibe, a presidential adviser.</p><p></p><p>Two other laws on child begging and child trafficking have rarely been enforced because of contradictions in the legal system and pressure from religious quarters that still wield considerable political and economical influence within the country.</p><p></p><p>\"[Child] traffickers take refuge behind article 245 of the penal code, which contradicts the 2005 law and states that soliciting alms as part of religious traditions is not an act of begging. What's more, there is intense lobbying and pressure from some Qur'anic masters whenever the government takes drastic measures against child trafficking,\" said Sidibe.</p><p></p><p>Parents sending their children away with marabouts in an informal system known as <em>confiage</em> is not a new phenomenon in Senegal. The parents see this as an opportunity for the child to learn about Islam but poverty often plays an important role in this decision. The victims of the fire were aged between seven and 12, and came from the Kolda region, one of the poorest areas of Senegal.</p><p></p><p>\"Senegal allocates just 0.8% of its budget to the ministry of family, which is responsible for social safety nets,\" said Jean Lieby, head of child protection for Unicef Senegal. \"Unicef is piloting a 'cash transfer' programme that aims to give impoverished parents grants so they can feed, clothe and protect their children from abuse, exploitation and trafficking.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel search and rescue type operation, which is also funded by Unicef, in urban centres including Dakar and Kolda identifies vulnerable children and reintegrates them with their families, many of whom have no idea of their child's suffering.</p><p></p><p>Mariama Diao, who sent her son, Mamadou, away with a travelling marabout from Guinea-Bissau, only found out how her son was suffering when a talibé<em> </em>from the same daara<em> </em>in Dakar told her that Mamadou had run away.</p><p></p><p>\"We sent Mamadou away with the marabout<em> </em>to learn about Islam, but we didn't hear from him in four years,\" said Diao, from Guiré Yéro, a small village near the border with Guinea-Bissau. \"The last time the marabout<em> </em>came back to the village, he told us Mamadou was doing fine, that he was not just begging, but also learning the Qur'an, even though he didn't know where Mamadou was,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Marabouts who mistreat children in this way should be punished with the full force of the law,\" Diao added.</p><p></p><p>Mamadou was eventually found and returned to his family by La Lumière, a local NGO that reintegrates children into their communities. According to the NGO, some parents had been told by marabouts<em> </em>that their children were dead when they were not.</p><p></p><p>The mistreatment of children has prompted some religious leaders to speak up against child begging. Just weeks before the fire, a highly respected relgious leader had told parents to stop sending their children away with marabouts in an article in the daily Le Quotidien that was seen as the first time such a high-ranking <em>Khalife </em>had<em> </em>spoken out publicly on the issue of talibés.</p><p></p><p>\"Stop sending your children to study outside of your locality. There, they are good for begging, hard work and beatings,\" said Khalife Thierno Amadou Baldé, the 70-year-old spiritual leader of the Peuhl people. His intervention has been seen as possibly heralding a shift back to the old system of confiage, where Qur'anic schools were part of the village and parents could supervise their children. However, such alignment between political and religious powers has drawn suspicion.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/senegal\">Senegal</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa\">Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/child-labour\">Child labour</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection\">Child protection</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children\">Children</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/misha-hussain\">Misha Hussain</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Last year, it approved a further $90m (£58m) of the $400m project to smooth out customs procedures, upgrade the road, and monitor the transmission of HIV/Aids along the route.</p><p></p><p>Work on the Abidjan-Lagos road is under way, a source in the Ghanaian government said, linking the three regional economic powerhouses of Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria, as well as Togo and Benin.</p><p></p><p>\"The Ghana section of this road is almost complete, and will be finished in 24 months' time,\" the source said. \"This is something the government of Ghana takes seriously,\" the source added. \"The World Bank has provided a loan, but Ghana has co-financed the project, and will have to pay the loan back.\"</p><p></p><p>But the plethora of donors involved in infrastructure projects is one of the challenges in the completion of the broader highway project.</p><p></p><p>\"The trans-west African highway does exist – west African countries have committed themselves to see to the completion of it,\" said Bernard Abeiku Arthur, an expert on urban transportation in Ghana.</p><p></p><p>\"But the issue is that these countries are depending on donor funds for their infrastructure needs. Just here in Ghana, the parts of the road that have been completed include the George W Bush highway built with American funding, the road to Cape Coast built with Japanese funding, from Cape Coast to Takoradi built with German funding, and from Takoradi to Elubo that has been funded by the Danish.\"</p><p></p><p>The failure of west African countries to complete the highway comes amid growing recognition of the cost of poor coastal transport links to the region.</p><p></p><p>In addition to poor roads, the route between coastal west Africa is plagued by illegal checkpoints and slow, non-harmonised customs procedures. The absence of any coastal railway system and limited coastal shipping makes these unreliable roads the only option for the movement of goods and services, hindering intra- and inter-regional trade.</p><p></p><p>\"We are linking up with neighbouring countries to create joint border posts to harmonise manuals and procedures,\" said the Ghana government source.</p><p></p><p>But the Lagos-Abidjan route raises questions about the rest of the trans-west African highway. \"As far as I know, this is absolutely an ongoing project,\" said Barry Gilbert-Miguet from the <a href=\"http://www.irfnet.org/\" title=\"\">International Road Federation</a>. \"But at the moment there are significant gaps in it. Across the world it is becoming harder and harder to finance roads, not least in Africa.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/trade-and-development\">Trade and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/governance-and-development\">Governance</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ghana\">Ghana</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ivory-coast\">Ivory Coast</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa\">Africa</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/afuahirsch\">Afua Hirsch</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Everyone knows that, certainly the development community and they don't need to be reminded of it. What they do need reminding of is that no one group can possibly solve this problem.</p><p>Strategic collaborations around climate change issues and action are essential. As World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said recently: \"To deliver bold solutions on climate change, we need to listen to and engage broader and more diverse audiences.\" This is what the <a href=\"http://www.connect4climate.org\" title=\"\">Connect4Climate</a> (C4C) team has set out to do since the programme began in 2011.</p><p>C4C is a global partnership programme dedicated to climate change and supported by the World Bank, Italy's environment ministry and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). We operate as a coalition of more than 150 knowledge partners ranging from major UN agencies to academic institutions to media organisations and NGOs.</p><p>Our aim is to convene different organisations, groups and individuals who wouldn't normally speak to one another, around the table to talk about climate change. The first audience we had to convince of the merits of building relationships and networks outside of those which seem immediately relevant, was our own within the World Bank.</p><p>To initiate constructive conversations about climate change, we had to admit that creative ideas do not only come from economists. And unlike some of the prevailing structures within development, we needed to create an open platform that is genuinely equal. C4C thus was made a coalition, not a World Bank dominated initiative.</p><p>C4C has worked with many disparate groups. Recently, we partnered with the first Italian carbon neutral private sector firm Alcantara and co-hosted a series of panel discussions on sustainability featuring high-profile individuals from architecture, design, fashion, social advocacy, corporate social responsibility, entertainment, and the arts. Some of the 300,000 people who attended Milan design week attended the debates and others followed the live stream or tweets. Milan was chosen to target the entertainment industry – to influence the influencers.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.connect4climate.org/blog/alcantaradialogues\" title=\"\">Alcantara dialogues/Connect4Climate: re-think, redesign, renew</a> discussion series has led to multiple creative projects. Here are a few lessons that are worth sharing from these experiences:</p><h2>Partnership across sectors calls for humility</h2><p>Whether we are trying to engage with small grassroots climate change groups or with leaders in fashion and architecture, it is important to be positive about the work of others. People are more open to hearing what part they have to play if they do not feel that they are being judged or patronised. We as development professionals must start by giving credit where credit is due and acknowledge the pressures that various organisations face within their own environments. At C4C, we have tried not to fixate on any organisation's past failures if we can see that they are keen to start taking steps in the right direction. We focus instead on empowering them so that they do the right thing.</p><h2>Scaremongering doesn't help</h2><p>We empower individuals and organisations by talking about small actions that lead to positive change. Giving people options make them feel empowered. That is not to say that the campaign organisations that impress upon us the urgency of the climate change situation – particularly for the world's poorest – shouldn't do what they do. We realise that our power lies in our ability to convene a diversity of players around a common cause. The idea is to not replicate any organisation but acknowledge the value that all organisations can bring to the table. A more pragmatic approach is key to starting new conversations with new people.</p><h2>Extensive research is the only way to find out what tools work</h2><p>Focusing simply on Twitter and Facebook would have meant limited reach in the developing world. In Africa, radio has been the most effective medium to get the climate change message out, and equally to hear back from communities. Even where internet connectivity isn't the dominant problem, there are other social networks that are used as our work with South Africa-based Mxit – Africa's largest social network with 50 million users across the continent has shown us. Few things just 'go viral', it takes  research and hard work to understand your target audience.</p><h2>Don't reinvent the wheel</h2><p>In addition to running competitions that reward winners by giving them the opportunity to have their voices heard, we decided C4C needed to be a platform that pointed interested groups in the direction of existing knowledge, rather than replicating it. The question we are always asking ourselves is: 'what is it that we are missing?'</p><p>There are three prevailing truths that shape the work we do: the first is that there have been far too may COP summits. We are now heading towards COP19, without a binding global deal on climate. The second is that no one group has the silver bullet to address climate change. Lastly, no single organisation has nearly enough resources to tackle the issue on their own.</p><p>What this means then is that we need a new way of thinking about and framing the climate change discourse. We have chosen to prioritise capacity building and creative cross-sector collaboration. If the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/connect4climate\" title=\"\">Alcantara dialogues</a> are anything to go by, more people care about the future of the planet than we give them credit for, and seemingly unusual suspects are willing to put time and resources into seeking solutions. These are small steps in the right direction, as we aim to inspire individuals and organisations from a wide range of disciplines to 're-think, redesign, and renew.'</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Lgrenna@worldbank.org\" title=\"\"><em>Lucia Grenna</em></a><em> is the programme manager at Connect4Climate.

With 19,000 children under five dying every day, <strong>Kumi Naidoo</strong> argues this money could be far better spent elsewhere</p><p>Last year $1.75tn was spent on the world's military, according to <a href=\"http://www.sipri.org/media/pressreleases/2013/milex_launch\" title=\"\">new estimates</a> released this Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI). Seems like a lot? Let me put this into perspective. This amount is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29\" title=\"\">equivalent</a> of Canada's GDP or twice the GDP of the Netherlands.</p><p>Nato members together spent a trillion dollars on the military and despite a significant 6% decrease, the US remains firmly in the lead, accounting for about 40% of the global amount. With a considerable percentage of citizens' taxes both in America (where it's <a href=\"http://demilitarize.org/general/income-tax-money-federal-budget-2014-fiscal-year/\" title=\"\">up to 47%</a>) and across the globe going towards military expenses, surely people are entitled to question whether this is money well spent to ensure security. And how this spending is more justified than, say, investing in renewable energy, health care and education.</p><p>Consider this: every day <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/mdg/index_childmortality.htm\" title=\"\">19,000 children</a> under the age of five die around the world, mainly from preventable causes. The costs of reducing mortality rates by two-thirds, improving maternal health as well as combating Aids, malaria and other major diseases, are estimated <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/social/poverty/50463407.pdf\" title=\"\">to be $60bn</a>  (£39bn) a year. Meanwhile, $60bn is approximately the cost of buying and operating two nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The estimated total cost of achieving the six of the UN's <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> related to poverty, education and health – eradicating hunger, universal primary education, child mortality reduction, disease prevention– is $120bn annually in additional resources, a fraction of what is spent every year on militaries.</p><p>We at Greenpeace join the outcry against excessive military spending. Rather than spending money preparing for conflict, governments must focus their efforts on avoiding conflict and achieving sustainability and equity in their countries.</p><p>Climate change is a major driver of conflict and threat to international and national peace and security, putting billions of people's future in jeopardy. It is not often the case that we find ourselves in agreement with the military and intelligence communities, but when it comes  to the security implications of climate change, it seems we may have some similar concerns. In May 2012, <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=116192\" title=\"\">US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said</a>: \"Climate change has a dramatic impact on national security: rising sea levels, to severe droughts, to the melting of the polar caps, to more frequent and devastating natural disasters all raise demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\"</p><p>These impacts of climate change are already being felt. Climate change and a carbon-intensive economy are already responsible for <a href=\"http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CVM_RELEASE_FINAL_ENGLISH.pdf\" title=\"\">5 million deaths</a> each year. By 2030, deaths could total 100 million. This is already costing <a href=\"http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CVM2ndEd-FrontMatter.pdf\" title=\"\">about $1.2tn</a> a year, which could double by 2030 if global temperatures are allowed to rise. So why is it that governments carry on spending $105bn a year on nuclear weapons, rather than diverting the amounts to mitigating the risks of the true WMD – \"weather of mass destruction\"?</p><p>Governments intent on spending taxpayers' money are fuelling the problem, rather than the solution. A <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr1393.htm\" title=\"\">new report</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveals that worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels total $1.9tn annually. Almost 9% of all annual country budgets are spent on supporting oil, natural gas and coal industries. Subsidies result in overconsumption of dirty energy, which fuels climate change. Eliminating subsidies would lead to a 13% decrease in global energy related CO2 emissions.</p><p>Moving <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Climate-Reports/Point-of-No-Return/\" title=\"Greenpeace report\">away from fossil fuels</a> and investing in renewable energy is the world's best hope for avoiding the most serious impacts of climate change. In 2011, renewable energy provided more than 30% of new electricity production globally, up from less than 5% in 2005. In 2012, investments in renewable energy approximated $250bn – which employed 5 million people worldwide, a win-win situation. An <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/\" title=\"Greenpeace energy report\">energy revolution</a> in the power sector – moving away from climate-destroying fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power – would require additional annual investments of $280bn – investments that would not only pay back financially but would significantly reduce the security threats resulting from climate change.</p><p>More than $3.5tn is spent annually on the world's military and on subsidising fossil fuels. We can no longer stand by and allow governments to spend recklessly on the wrong things, when so many right things remain neglected. Eradicating poverty and child mortality, and mitigating the destructive impacts of climate change could all be achieved if governments got their priorities right.</p><p><em>Kumi Naidoo is executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Greenpeace</em></a><em>.

The solutions below are some exceptional examples of grassroots level innovations. The question is – how many other potential world changing solutions have remained in obscurity at source, never replicating sufficiently to make a significant change?</p><p><strong>Combating climate change, water and food security in arid regions</strong></p><p>A single farmer in Burkina Faso started an <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa\" title=\"\">agricultural revolution in the semi-desert area where he lives</a>, which has spread to other parts of Burkina Faso and into neighbouring countries. The 'tree farming' approach he championed (by personally travelling to around 100 other villages by motorbike) has re-greened millions of acres in the dry Sahel region; enough so that the effects can be seen from outer space. The innovation: pits which were dug to concentrate rainfall onto crop roots were made larger, and manure was added to them during the dry season. Tree seeds in the manure sprouted with the crops and these tree saplings increased soil fertility, shielded crops from overwhelming heat, and acted as windbreaks. At the macro level, areas with trees are more efficient for water harvesting than areas without. Water tables in the areas with tree farming have risen since the method gained popularity, despite a growing population.</p><p><strong>System of rice intensification: increasing crop yields while reducing water demand and chemical usage. </strong></p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution\" title=\"\">recent article</a>, another agricultural approach was explored in depth: the system of rice intensification (SRI). Through applying zero cost techniques to rice farming, small scale rice farmers have increased their crop yields by anywhere from 30-50% while reducing water and chemical usage. What must be noted is that this solution has been <a href=\"http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/origin/index.html\" title=\"\">around for 30 years</a>. SRI is credited to Henri de Laulanie, who came across the methodology while working with farmers in Madagascar in 1983. He set up an NGO to promote SRI. It was taken up by Norman Uphoff at the Cornell Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/science/17rice.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\" title=\"\">advocated for post 1998</a>, and soon other countries started adopting the method.  SRI is now estimated to be used by 4-5 million farmers worldwide.</p><p>These examples are a small sample of grassroots solutions. Consider the idea of using a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0C-lSvbLT4\" title=\"\">plastic water bottle as a light bulb</a> in slums without power as another inspirational example of bottom up innovation. The question then, is how to ensure that these solutions are discovered and disseminated, rather than remaining localised in the areas they are conceived. Fortunately, there are both private and charitable organisations actively improving the chances of ideas spreading.</p><p><strong>Approach 1: the charity model </strong></p><p>Working with media partners in poverty stricken countries, <a href=\"http://www.sawaworld.org/\" title=\"\">Sawa World</a> trains unemployed or vulnerable youth to be reporters in their communities. This training provides the youth with a living wage, and reporters are tasked with reporting on solutions to poverty found within their own communities. These solutions are then shared through media channels such as radio or TV. In 2012, Sawa youths produced 94 videos on local solutions to extreme poverty. The organisation also provides 'Sawa leaders' (solution innovators), with support to communicate their solutions further afield, leading to far better exposure of effective innovations. In the past five years, Sawa World has supported 30 Sawa leaders in 11 of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>The clear focus of the model is appreciated. Their objectives and methods to effect change are unambiguous; but with a model that still relies on funding and charitable donations, the question remains as to whether Sawa World is, itself, scalable.</p><p><strong>Approach 2: the commercial model </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/\" title=\"\">GSMA</a> is an operator led trade association which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide. Through the  GSMA development fund, GSMA has been involved in projects bringing ICT and communications to multiple unconnected communities. A <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gsma-deloitte-impact-mobile-telephony-economic-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">study GSMA commissioned with Deloitte</a> estimates that an increase of 10% in mobile penetration will increase the GDP growth rate in developing nations by up to 1.2%.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://serving.webgen.gsm.org/5926DA9A-2DD6-48E7-BAD4-50D4CD3AF30A/assets/gsmacasestudymillenniumvillage-1.pdf\" title=\"\">millennium village case study</a> in Mayange, Rwanda, Ericsson president in sub-Saharan Africa Jan Embro says:</p><p>\"The integration of information and communications technology plays a critical role in ending the cycle of poverty, helping people share information and giving them the tools to improve their own social and economic situations.\"</p><p>The project focused on enabling entrepreneurs in the Mayange community to deliver communication and data services through community phones and computers. Entrepreneurs charge a fee to access the equipment, and in turn pay a co-operative to lease their equipment and lines. The entrepreneurs involved in the project increased their incomes by 20-22% while bringing greater connectivity to their communities.</p><p>While the GSMA model lacks the more direct focus of Sawa World on poverty solutions, it is assumed that connecting communities will allow for better dissemination of innovations. In another project with GSMA involvement, <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mkilimocasestudyfinal-1.pdf\" title=\"\">M-Kilimo</a> in Kenya advised rural farmers on best practices through a phone-in service. This is one of many possible uses of mobile connectivity. GSMA focuses on the commercial sustainability of their projects, allowing projects to scale more easily than in a donation-based model.</p><p><strong>The middle road: a role for social enterprise</strong></p><p>Both of the above approaches have their advantages and limitations. But there may be a middle road: a social enterprise with a commercially viable business model that focuses directly on propagating effective solutions at grassroot level.</p><p><em>Agustina Memoli, Paulina Polak, and Duncan Garde are 2012 </em><a href=\"http://www.onpurpose.uk.com\" title=\"\"><em>On Purpose</em></a><em> associates.

Indeed, it's the only thing that has.\" Then she lists the merits of giving up one's time for free, including learning from the source, travelling off the beaten path, applying your skills and then further down, working without previous experience.</p><p>Recognising the appeal of the above, as well as the opportunity to employ highly motivated individuals at low cost, or even <a href=\"http://www.whydev.org/how-volunteeering-in-development-became-duchessed/\" title=\"\">foster closer political relationships between countries</a>, a whole host of development organisations – from bilateral and multilateral donors to grassroots charities – have set up volunteering programmes. Indeed some of the largest and best known international NGOs have volunteerism at the centre of their strategy to fight poverty.</p><p>But can organisations that have their <a href=\"http://forum-ids.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/18402944-Future-Trends-2007-Opportunities-and-challenges-for-international-volunteer-cooperation.pdf\" title=\"\">roots in 19th century missionary work</a> and a development ethos that can be traced back to early 20th century post-war reconstruction efforts, still be relevant and applicable today?</p><p>For <a href=\"http://www.palms.org.au/blogpost/what-we-dont-do-5-rules-volunteering-overseas/\" title=\"\">Brendan Joyce</a>, assistant director of Palms Australia, the first point is that the activities which claim the title 'international volunteering' are diverse but are often tarred with the same brush. He says: \"Some [activities] are funded by government, others by private donors, others at the volunteer's own expense. Some can be slotted into a few days of an existing holiday while others demand two full years. Some take all comers, others are more selective. Some focus on short-term manual labour, some on technical skill transfer, others on relationships of mutual empowerment. Because of this diversity, volunteering is often seen by many development workers as a bad thing, an activity which promotes notions of a 'white saviour' helping people incapable of helping themselves.\"</p><p>So how can organisations that run volunteer programmes cultivate the right attitude among their volunteers? How can they communicate their value within a community that is often sceptical and as a development activity, what forms of volunteerism have the most impact and contribute to sustainable change?</p><p>Join our panel this Friday, 19 April from 1 to 3pm BST, to share best practice in volunteerism in international development.</p><p><em>The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below).

Put simply, forests have been worth more dead than alive.</p><p>As populations grow, emerging and industrialised countries are looking to the three great world forest regions – the Three Basins of the Congo, the Amazon and south-east Asia – for their growing resource needs. The economic imperative to acquire and clear more land increases daily as demand for food and commodities grows. More than half of the global forest loss has occurred in the Three Basins. But world food production needs standing forests not felled trees.</p><p>And forests are not about food: they .provide protection for local communities against catastrophic flooding and erosion during rainy seasons. The forests of the Three Basins act as huge carbon capture and storage units, drawing down around 10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions every year. They are the planet's principal defence against climate change – a fact that is often lost amid a debate about climate change that focuses almost entirely on fossil fuels. Destroying the forests makes our climate unstable and unpredictable, with increasing desert areas and more extreme weather. Conversely, addressing forest use in the Three Basins has huge potential to limit future damage from climate change.</p><p>Clearly, we need to stop damaging the world's forests but this is not as easy as it sounds. In the same way as fossil fuels are deeply embedded in the way countries develop, so is a centuries-old model of land use in which forested land is seen as a resource to be exploited. Stopping forest destruction overnight is neither possible nor desirable, as it would cause the price and availability of food and other commodities to rocket.</p><p>However, it is possible to get the balance right.</p><p>Brazil is already showing what is possible. By reducing deforestation by two thirds since 2004, <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/global_warming/Brazil-s-Success-in-Reducing-Deforestation.pdf\" title=\"\">Brazil has avoided an estimated 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions</a> – few people know that this is a larger reduction in emissions than any other country has managed.  This hasn't come at the cost of economic growth: at the same time, Brazil has lifted 10 million citizens out of poverty and continues to supply the world with food such as beef and soy, and other resources. My own country, Guyana, is maintaining 99.5% of our forest, while investing heavily in new economic sectors that take pressure off the forests over the long term. Many other forest countries in the Three Basins are willing to act.  Ambitious national proposals have been made.  Many, including Vietnam, Gabon and the Republic of Congo have detailed plans in place, backed by high-level political commitment.</p><p>If countries are ready to act: how do we deliver development, reduce poverty and feed increasing numbers of people while protecting the climate? The challenge is to invest in a new model of land use that addresses the drivers of forest loss, develops alternative sources of income and employment for forest communities, and meets the increasing demand for global food security This means decoupling poverty alleviation and economic growth from deforestation, much in the same way as the world is beginning to separate economic growth from fossil fuel use.</p><p>But this is difficult and expensive – and everyone who benefits need to share in paying for the valuable services forests provide. We need to make forests worth more alive than dead.</p><p>In 2009 in Copenhagen, hopes were high for a <a href=\"http://environment.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/DesigningaForestFinancingMechanism.pdf\" title=\"\">forest-financing mechanism</a> as part of a global climate deal which would recognise the climate services provided by those forests. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/17/us-copenhagen-100bn-climate-fund\" title=\"\">Pledges were made to mobilise $100bn</a> (£65bn) of new funding a year by 2020.  But despite the urgency, the process has stalled. Brazil and Guyana are showing what is possible when international partnership materialise: in both cases, Norway is paying for some of the avoided greenhouse gas emissions. But beyond Brazil, Guyana, and Indonesia, forest countries are faced with a reality that funds have been delayed; they are beginning to question whether a deal is possible.  Such slow progress puts millions of lives and livelihoods at risk in every part of the world. <a href=\"http://rovingambassadorjagdeo.org/en/new-report\" title=\"\">My consultation across the Three Basins</a> has shown that without the prospect of sufficient, secure, predictable finance it will be hard to resist growth through the continued destruction of forests.</p><p>A deal doesn't just make sense for food and the planet: it offers a new way of partnering for development. The west invests in forest-friendly economic growth and gets something in return – less exposure to weather-related damage, cheaper insurance premiums, and a lower need to invest in flood and other climate defences. A fair payment for the services provided by forests supports a forest country's own efforts towards development and poverty alleviation, creating the catalyst for private investment, entrepreneurship and sustainable employment.  In return, new markets for food and resources are developed, trade increases and we deliver climate change targets. This will not just bring momentum and confidence to these commitments, but will divert private capital away from deforestation towards maintaining forests sustainably.</p><p>International community should commit to deliver on existing pledges, including commitments to ramp up support for Three Basins countries to develop new forest-friendly economies as part of global efforts to combat hunger, nutrition and climate change. Just by delivering a fraction of funds that have already been promised – we estimate 9% – richer nations could kick start a change that benefits us all.</p><p><em>Bharrat Jagdeo was president of Guyana from 1999 to 2011.

However, Pinochet was probably a greater inspiration to Thatcher as the pioneer of radical free-market policies in the mid-1970s, a period when Keynesian policies still reigned in Britain and much of the rest of the world. At a fringe meeting during the Conservative party's annual conference in 1999, Thatcher implicitly acknowledged her debt to Pinochet, saying his enemies hated him because of his \"success\" in transforming Chile's economy from 1973 to 1990.</p><p>The Chilean strongman's free-market policies that the Iron Lady admired indeed transformed his country's economy, but in ways that could hardly be considered a success except among doctrinaire followers of the University of Chicago economist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/16/margaret-thatcher-impact-legacy-development\" title=\"\">Milton Friedman</a>. Pinochet's programme subjected his country to two major depressions in one decade, first in 1974-75, when GDP fell by 12%, then again in 1982-83, when it dropped by 15%. Contrary to ideological expectations about a positive correlation between free markets and robust growth, average GDP growth in 1974-89 – the radical phase of the Pinochet revolution – was only 2.6%. By comparison, with a much greater role for the state in the economy during 1951-71, Chile's economy grew by an average of 4% a year.</p><p>By the end of the radical free-market phase, both poverty and inequality had increased significantly. The proportion of families living below the \"line of destitution\" had risen from 12% to 15% between 1980 and 1990, and the percentage living below the poverty line, but above the line of destitution, had increased from 24% to 26%. By the end of Pinochet's regime, about 40% of Chile's population, or 5.2 million in a population of 13 million, was poor.</p><p>In terms of income distribution, the share of national income going to the poorest half of the population declined from 20.4% to 16.8%, while the share going to the richest 10% rose dramatically from 36.5% to 46.8%.</p><p>The combination of erratic growth and radical trade liberalisation resulted in \"deindustrialisation in the name of efficiency and avoiding inflation\", as one economist described it. Manufacturing's share of GDP declined from an average of 26% in the late 1960s to 20% in the late 1980s. Many metalworking and related industries went under in an export-oriented economy that favoured agricultural production and resource extraction.</p><p>Pinochet's neoliberal policies came to be codified as \"structural adjustment\", and Thatcher became one of structural adjustment's most enthusiastic promoters, not only for Britain but the world, popularising her approach with the slogan \"There is no alternative\". With Thatcher and the US president Ronald Reagan as its main boosters, and the World Bank and IMF as its executors, structural adjustment or the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story094/en/\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a> was generalised throughout the developing world.</p><p>From Ghana to Argentina, state participation in the economy was drastically curtailed, government enterprises passed to private hands in the name of efficiency, protectionist barriers on imports were eliminated wholesale, restrictions on foreign investment were lifted, and, through export-first policies, domestic economies were more tightly integrated into the capitalist world market.</p><p>Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), which set the stage for the accelerated globalisation of developing economies during the 1990s, created the same poverty, inequality and environmental crisis in most countries that free-market policies did in Chile. As the World Bank chief economist for Africa admitted: \"We did not think the human costs of these programmes could be so great, and the economic gains so slow in coming.\" So discredited were SAPs that the World Bank and IMF changed their name to poverty reduction strategy programmes in the late 1990s.</p><p>But the harm had been done. Two researchers from the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/\" title=\"\">Brookings Institution</a>, <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/chandyl\" title=\"\">Laurence Chandy</a> and <a href=\"http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/little-notice-globalization-reduced-poverty\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Gertz, described the wreckage</a>: \"Excluding China, the 500 million decrease in global poverty becomes an increase of 100 million. In the world's poorest region, sub-Saharan Africa, the poverty rate remained above 50% throughout the period, which, given the region's rapid population growth, translated into a near doubling in the number of its poor. Similarly in south Asia, Latin America and Europe-central Asia there were more poor people in 2005 than there were a quarter of a century earlier.\"</p><p>By the early 2000s, however, governments throughout the developing world were reversing course, with most turning towards pragmatism and abandoning the most damaging doctrinaire policies. The anti-neoliberal trend was most pronounced in Latin America, where elites had embraced neoliberalism most fervently in the 1980s and 1990s. Throughout the continent during the first decade of the 21st century, the combination of government intervention, economic nationalism, redistributive populist policies that promoted both equity and expanded internal markets, and the commodities boom triggered by China's development made up a potent combination that reversed trends in poverty.</p><p>This was the decade when Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Néstor Kirchner in Argentina, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Evo Morales in Bolivia boldly took their countries off structural adjustment, while others, such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, did it in less dramatic fashion. The title of a book by Financial Times correspondent Hal Weitzman says it all: <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137563/hal-weitzman/latin-lessons-how-south-america-stopped-listening-to-the-united\" title=\"\">Latin Lessons: How South America Stopped Listening to the United States and Started Prospering</a>.</p><p>Globally, the results of the turn from neoliberalism were dramatic.

So why don't state officials and policymakers take us, the citizens, into their confidence? Can we begin to see citizens as the greatest ally for good governance? And if so, how do we pursue a partnership between government and citizens?</p><p>Part of the answer lies in open data. According to the latest open budget index survey, <a href=\"http://www.southafrica.info/about/democracy/budget-290113.htm#.UWGdPr8R6IY#ixzz2PnNEcbb3\" title=\"\">South Africa ranks second out of 100 countries</a> for the transparency and accountability of its budget processes. <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/\" title=\"\">Statistics SA</a> has the most comprehensive data sets in Africa. Imagine if we could take the education budget at R230bn (£16.6bn) for 2013/2014 and break that down into the budget per school. Parents, students, teachers would be empowered to demand to see the accounts of expenditure. If salaries have been set aside for 20 teachers but only 15 are actually there, then the school governing board and community would be the government's biggest allies in rooting out corruption. If textbooks are not delivered, toilets not built when money is set aside, then immediate feedback can be given to the authorities. We would be decentralising governance and ensuring that parents have the tools to demand action in the constitutional right of their children to quality education.</p><p>On a trip to Kenya recently, I spoke at the launch of the <a href=\"http://code4kenya.org/\" title=\"\">Code4Kenya</a> initiative backed by government, the African Media Initiative, media companies, NGOs and the ICT sector as one of the first sustained attempts in Africa focused on making open data relevant to and used by citizens.</p><p>Using exam and school location data, the NGO <a href=\"http://twaweza.org/\" title=\"\">Twaweza</a> has developed an education application '<a href=\"http://findmyschool.co.ke/discover\" title=\"\">Find My School</a>' that citizens can use to check relative performance of primary schools in the country. A fascinating portal provides parents with information on how individual schools in Kenya perform in national examinations. Quality education, accountability, teacher performance and accountability are visibly transformed in the interests of the students and the country.</p><p>Africa is the fastest growing mobile market in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/africa-has-more-mobile-phone-users-than-the-us-or-eu/9053\" title=\"\">over 600 million users</a>. Using the pervasive mobile technology platform, we could avoid costly software applications and improve the performance of education.</p><p><strong>Best practice</strong></p><p>The transformative power of mobile technology in Kenya is well known. It is estimated that <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2013/02/31-kenyas-gdp-spent-through-mobile-phones/61595/\" title=\"\">over 30% of the Kenyan GDP</a> is circulating on the back of mobile platforms like <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">M-pesa</a>, putting effective financial services into the hands of the previously unbanked. Over 17 million customers can deposit, withdraw and transfer money, pay bills, buy airtime from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets.</p><p>Another example from Uganda is <a href=\"http://ureport.ug/\" title=\"\">U-report</a>, a free SMS service launched in 2011 with the support of Unicef, which gives young Ugandans a voice on issues they care about. The system has over 145,000 active U-reporters, and is growing through partnership with the government, NGOs, youth organisations, faith-based organisations and private companies. U-reporters join and answer an SMS poll or question on issues dealing with health, child protection, school, safe water, and more. Poll results are published in newspapers, reflected on radio, and placed directly into the hands of members of parliament. All text messages are free, a vital element in removing the barriers to participation.</p><p>There are lessons also to be learnt from the west. The New York City mayor's office, using the platform <a href=\"http://blog.allourideas.org/post/6326304438/making-new-york-greener-and-greater\" title=\"\">allourideas.org</a>, created an ideas marketplace, <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml\" title=\"\">PlaNYC</a>, with 25 ideas (eg: open schoolyards across the city – to know how public wanted the city to look and feel by 2030. New Yorkers responded by casting about 25,000 votes and uploading more than 400 new ideas. Critically, eight of the top 10 ideas came from citizens. In other words, some of these ideas represented either completely novel ideas or new ways of framing existing ideas.</p><p>Technology is indeed changing the way we live, organise our lives, work, and play or even educate ourselves and access services from government or the marketplace. But technology is just a tool, an enabler on which we need to develop the applications that make our society more efficient and customer-orientated.</p><p>In discussion with <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/40146527\" title=\"\">Christopher Finch</a>, a senior social development specialist with the World Bank in Kenya, I learnt the following lessons:</p><p>• Citizen engagement is essential for effective development, strengthening the quality of policymaking and the science of service delivery with improved social accountability.</p><p>• The key stakeholders involved in citizen engagement are government, civil society, academics, the private sector, the tech community and other development specialists. They need to share information and experience in enhancing citizen feedback and participation for development.</p><p>• It is time to move from the rich experience and knowledge generated by the various stakeholders to concrete action on citizen engagement that leads to more effective development results.</p><p>• New models are needed to increase sustainability. Open data is not just government data — it can come from many sources. Several host organisations have begun to set up their own data desks, to convert and re-organise hard copy data into digital, downloadable formats that can inform and deepen their reporting and analysis.</p><p>• Translating data into action can be a complex process but partnerships with the media and 'info-mediaries' can help make open data benefit citizens. Their role is to analyse and turn data into visualisations and applications that citizens use and want. But ultimately, making open data work depends on culture change. And this takes time and a lot of work.</p><p>What we need is the political will to co-create the tools with citizens and civil society, and to harness the expertise and technology of the marketplace to deliver the services to which our citizens have a right.</p><p><em>Jay Naidoo is chair of the board of directors and chair of the partnership council of the </em><a href=\"http://www.gainhealth.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition</em></a><em>.

He and his colleagues had been making waves by promoting \"economic liberalism\", including low taxes, the sale of state-owned industries, the removal of protectionist barriers, the primacy of private rather than government finance and, philosophically, the individual above the state.</p><p>Friedman won the Nobel prize in 1976 but, apart from advising Chile, he and his colleagues had little experience of government. That was to change as he and Thatcher's other like-minded economic adviser, Alan Walters, launched an economic revolution that was to reverberate through world bodies and gather pace as it was forced on to developing countries.</p><p>Within a few years of meeting Thatcher, Friedman was advising the US treasury, and most world bodies were beginning to adopt what became known as \"neoliberal\" ideas.</p><p>The new mantra of economic liberalisation – free trade, open markets, privatisation, deregulation and reducing the size of the public sector – spread rapidly across the world via the US and British treasuries' political domination of the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\" title=\"\">World Bank</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and, later, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade\" title=\"\">Gatt</a> – precursor to the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation</a>. In return for bailouts, over 90 indebted countries were forced to radically restructure their economies by opening their markets, reducing state spending and growing their exports.</p><p>Today, the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story084/en/\" title=\"\">structural adjustment programmes</a> (SAPs) imposed on developing countries might be called \"austerity\" programmes. They required poor countries to reduce spending on health, education and development, while debt repayment and other economic policies were to be made the priority.</p><p>The result was socially devastating. The divisions that emerged in Britain throughout Thatcher's 11 years of power were mirrored across the world. Because SAPs and global trade policies hit poor and working people particularly hard, the result was riots in south-east Asia, Latin America and Africa, price hikes and unemployment.</p><p>The path of global development, it is argued, was dramatically changed, marked throughout the 1980s by increasing inequality, the march of multinational companies, the globalisation of trade and the opening up of economies to a brand of capitalism that led to economic growth – but at the expense of unemployment, falling incomes and environmental destruction. The 1980s coincided with the greatest destruction of rainforest, the fastest growth of slums and the greatest increase of emissions.</p><p>Farming, cities and industry were all affected as people left the countryside, local markets were undermined as rich countries dumped more subsidised food and goods, and state-run industries were closed.</p><p>Thatcher's economic and cultural influence is still argued over. What is certain is that the policies she and her three successive governments backed had become the consensus of western governments by the time she left office in 1990, and still dominate economic thinking.</p><p><em>• John Vidal is the Guardian's environment editor</em></p><h2>She ignored social justice, equity and inclusiveness</h2><p>One of the key contributions that Thatcher made to development was her transformative leadership, with which she changed not only the course of her country, but also the understanding of what a UK prime minister can achieve and how. She contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall, which started a major transformation of central and eastern European economies from relying mostly on central planning to being governed by markets.</p><p>Thatcher's leadership style was strong, decisive and sometimes so uncompromising that it would undermine her objectives. Nevertheless she was admired for being principled and unafraid to stand up for her values and goals. Her unshakable belief in herself was both her greatest strength (and helped her become first female British prime minister) and greatest weakness (she became increasingly isolated from her voters).</p><p>Thatcher made a major contribution to economic policies, especially with her emphasis on enhancing competitiveness and the flexibility of labour and product markets. The focus on the deregulation of these markets underpins much of the work carried out by the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> and other international organisations today. Thatcher strongly believed in the benefits of privatisation. Her supporters credit her with turning the British economy around. These policies provided the core for the structural adjustment programmes applied by the IMF and World Bank to developing countries during the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>While many of the above policies may work in the UK or other advanced economies, without modification to the local context they tended to be ineffective in developing countries with weaker institutions and capacity. For example, labour market laws exist in many less developed countries, but they are rarely implemented. Similarly, the experience of eastern Europe revealed the weaknesses of privatisation programmes when markets are thin and corporate governance lacking. Moreover, perhaps because of her preoccupation with competition and markets, she did not pay enough attention to issues such as social justice, equity and inclusiveness – all critical development issues.</p><p>On a more positive note, it is still true that many African countries' private sectors could be more developed, economies less regulated, business environments more investor-friendly. While pursuing these economic objectives, the continent can draw on lessons from other regions, while also paying attention to inclusion. And it has been said on numerous occasions that structural transformation in Africa needs strong, visionary and determined leadership – perhaps not too distant from a contemporary version of the one Thatcher provided to Britain more two decades ago. Perhaps what the continent needs today is \"Thatcherism\" that is inclusive and shows the people of Africa its human face.</p><p><em>• Professor Mthuli Ncube is chief economist and vice-president of the </em><a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/\" title=\"\"><em>African Development Bank</em></a></p><h2>The problem with socialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people's money</h2><p>In much of the west, the post-second world war economic boom began sputtering even in the 1950s. The emergence of \"stop and go\" economics suggested that, sooner or later, choices would have to made, not just in Britain but around the world. The tragedy of the 1960s and 1970s was that many countries proved unwilling, or unable, to make the necessary choices.</p><p>The precise shape of the trap differed from country to country. Britain continued to strive for the impossible: to have, simultaneously, low unemployment, low inflation, a high and stable pound, and a positive balance of trade. The effort to \"have it all\" inevitably involved more and more state intervention in the economy, which many on the left prized as being somehow more fair than relying on the market. Not coincidentally, it also allowed them to pay off their political base.</p><p>The net result was to give greater power to the takers in the state and less to the makers in the private sector. There was never any reason to believe that governments – which are just small collections of individuals – would have the necessary wisdom to make better decisions than the market – a much larger collection of individuals. But the greater fallacy was in using the state as a crutch to avoid prioritising some good things over others.</p><p>In the end, as Thatcher pointed out, the problem with socialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people's money. There are numerous ways to ruin an economy, but the essence of any top-down system is that it promotes inflexibility, which is the antithesis of growth. At its worst, this gives you the Soviet Union. At its best, in the west, this gives you a system steadily smothered by its own vested interests, a problem that was even worse in the developing world which too often lacked the legal protection of property rights that we take for granted.</p><p>Thatcher's achievement was to challenge this increasingly stagnant status quo by making decisions about what to prioritise, thus rejecting the belief in the state as the enabler of all good things. Predictably, it earned her the hatred of the left. But it was the failure of state intervention that gave Thatcher her opening, which other western leaders – including François Mitterrand of France, who U-turned to the right – seized with gratitude or out of necessity. As Thatcher liked to say, \"There is no alternative.\" And by 1979, she was right.</p><p>• <em>Ted R Bromund is senior research fellow in Anglo-American relations at the </em><a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/departments/the-margaret-thatcher-center-for-freedom\" title=\"\"><em>Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom</em></a></p><h2>A reversion to a Dickensian variety of capitalism</h2><p>Since her death, many eulogies of Thatcher have spoken of her as a revolutionary. Thatcherism (along with the associated Reaganomics) is seen as a radical transformative agenda that changed the face of economy and society. But seen from the developing world decades later, much of this agenda appears familiar, in the form of structural adjustment policies that have been forced upon different countries at different times by international institutions.</p><p>Given the broad contemporaneity of these strategies, it is a moot point who \"inspired\" whom, or just how original those ideas were. But it is certainly true that they contributed to shaping policy dialogue in fundamental ways, and thereby left a continuing (if unfortunate) legacy. Consider just five significant elements of this legacy, most features of which are now found across the world and especially in developing countries:</p><p>First, and possibly the most well-known: the attack on organised labour and the resulting drastic reduction in workers' bargaining power. This occurred not just through the instrument of unemployment (or fear of it) used to discipline workers, but through regulation and legal changes as well as changing institutions. This is now an almost universal feature, except in societies such as in Latin America where recent political changes have generated some reversal.</p><p>Second, financial deregulation and significant increases in the lobbying and political power of financial agents. This has led to the massive expansion and then implosion of deregulated finance, with the crisis affecting the real economy in terrible ways. It has also contributed to deindustrialisation and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_state\" title=\"\">rentier economy</a>. The UK today is clearly one, with its focus on the City of London as its most prominent \"industry\" – but this is increasingly the fate of countries that are much lower in the development and per capita income ladders.</p><p>Third, the triumph of private gain over social good and the aggressive delegitimisation of public provision. Quite apart from the adverse effects on the long term (in terms of inadequate public investment for the future or for meeting current social needs) this has terrible effects on society, creating not just injustice but small-minded and petty individualism as a dominant social characteristic.</p><p>Fourth, the weakening or destruction of notions of the rights of citizens, particularly social and economic rights. Most citizens of the developing world are still struggling for these to be recognised, so the rapid derecognition of such rights in the post-Thatcher era has been a setback for everyone – and is only too obvious in much of Europe today.</p><p>Fifth, sharply increasingly inequalities of assets, incomes, opportunities, which has become socially and economically counterproductive everywhere and increasingly politically destabilising as well.</p><p>Was Thatcherism then all that new?

The journey takes the 23-year-old through a simmering city.</p><p>Protests and clashes in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country have diminished in recent weeks but with about 100 dead and thousands injured, tensions remain high. A series of \"shutdowns\" have been enforced by political groups, more are threatened and many fear violence will flare again.</p><p>The battle pits religious conservatives against more moderate, progressive voices in a fight to determine the future direction of the country – the world's eighth most populous – 40 years after it won independence from Pakistan in a brutal war.</p><p>The most recent development is the emergence of a radical conservative Muslim party, Hefazat-e-Islam, as the standard bearer of the religious right. Earlier this month, at a huge rally in Dhaka attended by more than 100,000 according to police, the party <a href=\"http://www.therecord.com/news/world/article/914508%E2%80%93hardline-muslims-rally-in-bangladesh-seeking-anti-blasphemy-law-amid-nationwide-shutdown\" title=\"\">issued 13 demands</a>. They included the introduction of measures to stop \"alien culture\" making inroads in Bangladesh, the reinstatement of the line \"absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah\" in the nation's constitution, which is largely secular, and a ban on new statues in public places.</p><p>But it was Hefazat-e-Islam's demand that men and women do not mix in public – seen by many as a bid to stop women working outside the home – that most worried Akhter, one of tens of millions of female labourers in Bangladesh's booming garment industry.</p><p>\"If we are not allowed to work, how will we survive?\" asked Akhter, who supports her elderly parents on her monthly wage of 6,500 takas (£55). \"Many of our coworkers were abandoned by their husbands. Some families only have daughters, whose parents are old. What will a single mother do? We will not have any means for a living.\"</p><p>Hefazat-e-Islam's demand is opposed by employers too. \"There are women in media, defence, and development. There cannot be development [by] keeping half of a population ineffective,\" Mushrefa Mishu, president of the Garment Workers' Unity Forum, told the Guardian.</p><p>But beyond the issue of women working are much larger questions. \"Although Bangladesh is a Muslim-majority country, it is a people's republic, not a Muslim country,\" said Mishu.</p><p>The unrest was initially provoked by the first verdicts passed by the international war crimes tribunal, set up by Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister and daughter of the wartime leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to investigate atrocities committed during the 1971 conflict.</p><p>When a group of young moderates in Dhaka demonstrated in the central Shahbag Square, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/23/protest-death-penalty-bangladesh\" title=\"\">their protest quickly grew into a mass movement demanding accountability and harsh sentences</a> for alleged crimes during the war.</p><p>The conflict left up to 3 million people dead. At least 200,000 women were raped while millions fled to neighbouring India.</p><p>Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), opposed the independence movement during the 1971 war and worked with the Pakistani army to fight nationalists. It is largely senior officials from JI who have been indicted by the tribunal. Two have been convicted this year.</p><p>Religious conservatives, many loyal to JI, took to the streets to counter the Shahbag demonstrators, accusing their leaders of being atheists and blasphemers.</p><p>Some of the violence has been explicitly sectarian, with attacks on places of worship of the small Hindu minority. Several activists have been shot dead by the police who routinely use live ammunition to quell protest.</p><p>The leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP), Khaleda Zia, the widow of the independence war's best-known military commander, has accused Hasina of using the tribunal to hound political enemies.</p><p>In turn, Zia has been charged with encouraging and exploiting the rightwing anger. Hefazat-e-Islam are close to JI, which is a key ally of the BNP.</p><p>The conservatives say they are victims of a smear campaign and that their aims have been misunderstood. \"The idea that Hefazat-e-Islam is taking the country back to the medieval age through its demands is propaganda,\" said Moinuddin Ruhi, joint secretary of the party. \"We are not opposing women's development … Hefazat demands women refrain from free mixing in society to avoid sexual harassment and incidents such as rape. This does not … mean we want them to refrain from going to work or study. They should go to work and study following the principles of Islam.\"</p><p>Akhter countered that she and her female colleagues were \"responsible enough to protect our own prestige and self-respect\".</p><p>Hefazat-e-Islam officials say they will \"besiege\" Dhaka next month if the government does not agree to their demands.</p><p>There are fears that the pressure from the conservatives is having an effect. Shortly after officials said their demands would be considered last week, police detained four bloggers who are seen as sympathetic to the Shahbag movement and critical of Islamists on charges of \"hurting religious sentiment\".</p><p>In Bangladesh, defaming a religion on the internet can carry a 10-year jail sentence. One of Hefazat-e-Islam's principal demands is that the death penalty be imposed in such circumstances.</p><p>Pinaki Bhattacharya, a blogger and online activist, describes the arrests as unacceptable. \"I believe we should not unnecessarily hurt someone's beliefs. I believe everybody should be sensible. Everybody should have their own sense of responsibility and they should not indulge into things which might create unrest and trouble in society,\" said Pinaki.</p><p>Police in Bangladesh have also arrested the acting editor of Amar Desh, a pro-opposition newspaper, on several charges, including sedition. Mahmudur Rahman of the Bengali-language publication was detained in a raid on his office in Dhaka, said a city police official Masudur Rahman.</p><p>The arrest has concerned local journalists. Nurul Kabir, editor-in-chief of Bangladesh's popular English daily New Age, said: \"I have serious disagreement with the editorial policy of Mahmudur Rahman and the most of the contents that his paper Amar Desh disseminates, but I have no doubt that the government has arrested him primarily because of his active support for the opposition political camps. In a democratic dispensation, this is unacceptable.\".</p><p>Elections are due in Bangladesh later this year or early in 2014.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bangladesh\">Bangladesh</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/employment\">Employment</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jasonburke\">Jason Burke</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Its limits were tested in New Zealand last year by a 36-year-old Kiribati man who <a href=\"http://tcktcktck.org/2012/09/man-from-drowning-pacific-island-of-kiribati-denied-climate-refugee-status/31067\" title=\"\">argued before an immigration tribunal</a> that he should not be deported because he feared for his own future and that of his children's because of the effects of climate change in his country, barely two metres above sea level.</p><p>The tribunal rejected his claims and confirmed his deportation order after holding that the Refugee Convention gave no protection to those claiming to be endangered by climate change.</p><p>But the president of the partly public-funded Refugee Council of Australia, Phil Glendenning, who was in <a href=\"http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/paradise-submerged-a-nation-going-under/590/\" title=\"\">Kiribati</a> in March, says Australia needs to formally recognise climate change refugees because there's \"a big chance\" that climate change in the Pacific would force large numbers of people from their homelands.</p><p>Glendenning says Australia should prepare to cater for thousands of climate change refugees over and above the 20,000 refugees it admits from war-torn nations every year.</p><p>\"These are people who are not suffering from persecution because of their beliefs, race or because they belong to a particular group. So they don't meet the Refugee Convention criteria but, nevertheless, there will be a need for people to be resettled because they have been displaced by climate change,\" says Glendenning. \"This is a new cohort of people who are emerging, the rest of the world needs to pay attention.\"</p><p>Australia's Labor government – trailing massively in opinion polls and facing an election in September at which the increased numbers of asylum seekers is expected to be a hot issue – is unlikely to agree to increase its refugee intake before the election.</p><p>The opposition, a Liberal-National coalition that is expected to unseat Julia Gillard, has vowed to cut Australia's intake by 6,000 places upon coming into office.</p><p>Glendenning, however, says he has raised the need for a special category of climate change refugees in talks with senior officials in the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship.</p><p>\"This is beginning to emerge as an international issue ... the Department of Immigration didn't rule it out, of course. It didn't get a negative hearing, it's [a proposal] very much in its infancy.\"</p><p>Kiribati, formerly part of the British-administered Gilbert and Ellice Islands, straddles the equator. Its 33 tiny atolls and islands – many of which are uninhabited – extend for 5,000 kilometres across the Pacific Ocean. Most are extremely low-lying and the country's main atoll of Tarawa is now dangerously overcrowded as more people from outer islands flock to Tarawa seeking work and protection from climate change.</p><p>Rising sea levels and more intense storms have inundated low-lying coastal land within Kiribati, contaminating vital fresh water supplies beneath some atolls, killing food plantations and shrinking the available land.</p><p>Kiribati's president, Anote Tong, a graduate of the London School of Economics, has told his people that many should prepare to leave under a policy he terms \"migration with dignity\". Last month he announced that Kiribati would purchase 3,000 hectares of agricultural land in Fiji to grow food and as an investment. He has denied that he plans to send people there to live.</p><p>President Tong, who has long campaigned for greater international recognition and aid for his country's plight, told the Global Mail that despite frantic efforts within Kiribati to stem the effects of climate change – by building sea walls and protecting fresh water supplies – his people would have to migrate to survive. He says Kiribati will increase its efforts to train and educate its young people so that they have a greater chance of making a new life in a different country.</p><p>\"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate,\" says president Tong. \"Either we can wait for the time when we have to move people en masse or we can prepare them – beginning from now ...\"</p><p>• Bernard Lagan's full report on Kiribati <a href=\"http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/kiribati-a-nation-going-under/590/\" title=\"\">is published on The Global Mail</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/climate-change-a-line-in-the-sand/591/\">See The Global Mail's photo essay on Kiribati</a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change\">Climate change</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/sea-level\">Sea level</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia\">Australia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific\">Asia Pacific</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/refugees\">Refugees</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kiribati\">Kiribati</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/water\">Water</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/least-developed-countries\">Least Developed Countries</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the 1980s, the island became almost a byword for \"structural adjustment\". Jamaica is one of the most indebted countries, spends twice as much on debt repayments as it does on education and health combined, and looks set to miss <a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/download.php?id=1119\" title=\"\">several millennium development goals</a> (pdf). After four decades of austerity, the country has a few lessons for the likes of Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13107.htm\" title=\"\">The IMF has announced</a> a $1bn (£650m) loan to \"help\" Jamaica meet huge debt payments due in coming years. As usual, the loan is to be accompanied by four years of austerity – precise details still pending, though a pay freeze, amounting to a 20% real-terms cut in wages, <a href=\"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/IOUs-threaten-Government-wage-targets_13878481\" title=\"\">has been agreed</a>.</p><p></p><p>This austerity will be applied to an economy that has effectively not grown since 1990. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jul/22/jamaica-debt-crisis\" title=\"\">Huge debt has been a constant burden, with foreign debt payments of more than 20% of government revenue every year</a>. When the financial crisis hit, the island was pushed into full-scale recession, before being pounded by Hurricane Sandy last year.</p><p></p><p>But Jamaica's problems go back much further. The island's economy has been shaped by centuries of violence, plunder and slavery. Hundreds of thousands of lives were wasted on sugar plantations, which \"<a href=\"http://eblackstudies.org/intro/chapter3.htm\" title=\"\">kept the wheels of metropolitan industry turning</a>\" in Britain.</p><p></p><p>Jamaica never recovered from slavery; former slaves remained deeply impoverished, and the economy almost totally dependent on foreign capital, mining and raw materials, while importing food and other essentials.</p><p></p><p>Jamaica became independent from Britain in 1962, but it was only in the 1970s that the government of Michael Manley initiated policies to reduce dependency on foreign capital, improve living standards and fight inequality. He supported health and education, nationalised industries, increased taxation on foreign investment and encouraged agricultural self-sufficiency.</p><p></p><p>Manley became a major figure on the global stage, joining leaders of the non-aligned movement to support the New International Economic Order – a radical set of economic policies to give developing countries genuine economic independence and reduce global inequality. In 1975, Manley told Americans: \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/08/world/michael-manley-ex-premier-of-jamaica-is-dead-at-72.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm\" title=\"\">Gross maldistribution of the world's wealth and food is no longer a moral offence only</a>. It now represents the greatest practical threat to peace and to any desirable development of mankind.\"</p><p></p><p>But his project ran up against the oil crisis of the 1970s. As the price of imports rocketed and exports fell, Jamaica was forced to run up debts. When interest rates rose at the start of the 1980s, debt payments shot up: from 16% of exports in 1977 to a gigantic 35% by 1986.</p><p></p><p>This gave the IMF and World Bank the leverage to impose large-scale structural adjustment policies. The impact was devastating. During the 1980s, <a href=\"http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/33344/1/115762.pdf\" title=\"\">the number of registered nurses fell by 60%</a> (pdf). Abolition of food subsidies and currency devaluation made the cost of food rocket, while the IMF held down wages. Health, education and housing were run into the ground. Many suffered what Oxfam called \"<a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/jamaica-debt-and-poverty-123007\" title=\"\">a grim daily struggle to pay for food</a>, clothing and transportation – even on the part of people who 10 years ago would have been considered middle-class\".</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, Manley returned to office, accepting the impossibility of creating an independent economy, and embracing neo-liberal policies as the only solution, much to the delight of the US and IMF.</p><p></p><p>There has been no progress in cutting hunger, or increasing basic water and sanitation provision. In 1990, 97% of children completed primary school. Now only 73% do. In 1990, 59 mothers died in childbirth for every 100,000 children born. Now it is 110.</p><p></p><p>Jamaica has repaid more money ($19.8bn) than it has been lent ($18.5bn), yet the government still \"owes\" $7.8bn, as a result of huge interest payments. Government foreign debt payments ($1.2bn) are double the amount spent on education and health combined ($600m).</p><p></p><p>Jamaica is classified as upper middle income. It was never eligible for debt relief. It has gone through deals with domestic private lenders to reduce interest rates, with little impact on government debt. As always, foreign creditors are fully protected.</p><p></p><p>Jamaica is not alone. Several Caribbean countries are also dangerously indebted. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/022013b.pdf\" title=\"\">The IMF itself says</a> (pdf): \"Since growth in the current environment is virtually non-existent, significant fiscal consolidation is inevitable, but may not be enough to bring down such high debt levels.\" Translation: countries like Jamaica need to make deep cuts, but because there is and will be no growth, the debt will remain.</p><p></p><p>The IMF \"rescue\" is a rescue for Jamaica's creditors. It spells more suffering for its people. As Europe enters a fourth year of debt and austerity, Jamaica enters a fourth decade. The island's debt needs to be written off, to open up the possibility for a better future and allow the people to take control of their economy.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/millennium-development-goals\">Millennium development goals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jamaica\">Jamaica</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/debt-relief\">Debt relief</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nick-dearden\">Nick Dearden</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The net income of the largest trading houses since 2003, the FT reported, surpasses that of the combination of Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Though Higgins welcomed the introduction of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jun/23/g20-action-plan-to-curb-food-prices\" title=\"\">agriculture markets information system</a> by the G20 group of countries to provide transparency in key commodity markets, he emphasised that there are urgent moral and ethical issues in relation to food speculation, particularly at times of famine.</p><p>\"We must not lose the opportunity to put the stamp of our shared humanity on these challenges,\" he said. \"The institutional and structural reforms that are necessary are now more urgent than ever. We need both bottom-up and top-down processes to create an enabling environment where marginalised groups have the capacity to claim their rights. This means overcoming perceived constraints and ensuring that political processes towards the solutions are accountable, participative and courageous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the UN agency for children (Unicef) <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/files/nutrition_report_2013.pdf\" title=\"\">released a report highlighting successful examples from 11 countries of tackling malnutrition</a> (pdf). The report said more and more countries are scaling up their nutrition programmes to reach children during the critical period from pregnancy to two years old. These programmes are working, says Unicef, as countries that are reaching mothers and children with effective nutrition during the first 1,000 days are achieving results.</p><p>\"Stunting can kill opportunities in life for a child and kill opportunities for development of a nation,\" Anthony Lake, Unicef's executive director, said. \"Our evidence of the progress that is being achieved shows that now is the time to accelerate it.\"</p><p>One in four of all under-five children – 165 million children – is stunted because of chronic undernutrition in crucial periods of life. An estimated 80% of the world's stunted children live in only 14 countries. The damage done to a child's body by stunting is irreversible. It drags down performance at school and future earnings. Stunted children are also at a higher risk of dying from infectious diseases than other children.</p><p>The report highlights successes in Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Tanzania and Vietnam. In DRC, a community-based approach is significantly increasing the number of children receiving treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Kyrgyzstan, one of the poorest countries in Europe and central Asia, has pioneered the distribution of sachets of nutrients to infants to combat anaemia. Vietnam last year passed legislation extending maternity leave and banning advertising of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/17/formula-milk-firms-mother-breastfeeding\" title=\"\">breastmilk substitutes</a> for children up to 24 months.</p><p>In Maharashtra, India's wealthiest state and second most populous, 39% of children under two were stunted in 2005-06. That dropped to 23% by 2012, according to a state-wide nutritional survey, largely by the efforts of frontline workers improving child nutrition. In Peru, stunting fell by a third between 2006 and 2011 following an initiative that lobbied political candidates to sign a \"5 by 5 by 5\" commitment to reduce stunting in children under five by 5% in five years and to lessen inequities between urban and rural areas.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/malnutrition\">Malnutrition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/hunger\">Hunger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland\">Ireland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/international-land-deals\">International land deals</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktran\">Mark Tran</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Based on signs of success, PFM is being rolled out in larger areas. A particularly ambitious scheme is taking place in the mountains of Bale in the southern region of Oromia, where the authorities are applying PFM to 500,000 hectares (1.24m acres) of forest in a <a href=\"http://www.farmafrica.org/ethiopia/forest-management-in-bale-eco-region\" title=\"\">project run by Farm Africa</a>, a British NGO in partnership with SOS Sahel, a local NGO.</p><p>Ethiopia has experienced massive deforestation. From a baseline of perhaps 40% forest cover in the 16th century, the country is down to 4.6%, a result of 0.8% deforestation a year. Pressure on forests comes from a rapidly growing population – 85 million – with over 80% living in rural areas, relying on rain-fed agriculture. The 70 million livestock put pressure on land and forests.</p><p>Starting the first PFM projects was difficult, Tsegaye Tadesse, programme manager with Farm Africa, told the Guardian, on a visit to London.</p><p>\"We were not welcomed by communities at first,\" says Tadesse, who has worked in forestry since the 1980s. \"Imagine being told that you will no longer have free access – despite laws prohibiting you from cutting down trees. You would want to carry on with the easy way, coming and going as you choose.\"</p><p>The government applied a carrot and stick approach. Officials raised the spectre of eviction and bused forest dwellers hundreds of kilometres to areas that had suffered extensive deforestation to show them the bleak future that was in store once the forests had disappeared. \"We took community representatives to degraded areas so they could see the results of failing to take proper care of forests,\" he says.</p><p>The carrot was managed use of the forest – including logging – for an unspecified time. In Ethiopia, land is owned by the state so it cannot be sold or used as collateral. Nevertheless, the offer of legal exploitation of resources was used as an incentive to gain the involvement of forest communities.</p><p>It took eight years to apply PFM to 5,000 hectares, in Chilmo, about 90km west of Addis Ababa, the capital. It has become easier since the first projects because now, says Tadesse, forest communities can see successful examples of PFM. \"It is a bit like vaccines. It takes a lot of money to develop at first, but once you have it, things become easier,\" he says.</p><p>Besides husbanding forest resources, PFM also develops money-making activities. In Bale, forest communities have been taught to grow coffee and bamboo and to become bee-keepers. Of the 23,000 households (an average of five people per household) covered by the Bale project, about 3,500 have taken up these activities. But Tadesse says efforts to develop alternative livelihoods are being hampered by the lack of a strong private sector.</p><p>\"The idea was to bring in the private sector,\" he says. \"But it is not strong enough yet to develop the continuous supply of forest coffee, natural oils and honey. We know the consumers are there – there is strong demand for honey in Addis. But we need hives to be distributed, technical support. Markets are not functioning as well as they should.\"</p><p>Tadesse says the results have been encouraging from the first PFM pilot project, in Chilmo, where satellite imagery has shown a 9.2% increase in forest cover. Communities are seeing an increase in incomes from sales of honey to Addis and coffee to Italian firms.</p><p>\"Families are sending children to colleges. Thatched roofs are being replaced by corrugated iron, but we need to find out more about how big an impact these livelihoods are having,\" Tadesse says.</p><p>One unintended consequence of PFM has been the growth of a sense of civic responsibility. \"There are always conflicts around natural resources. PFM involves lots of conflict mediation and exercises in negotiation. It has contributed to the building of stable communities and in building democracy at a grassroots level.\"</p><p>The question, as ever, is whether these communities can sustain themselves, once funding for the project stops. Funding of €5.4m (£4.6m) from Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands ended in December, although Norway has extended funding of €2m for another three years. With the help of Oxford University, Farm Africa is designing a scheme for Bale to tap into the UN's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/24/redd-reducing-emissions-from-deforestation\" title=\"\">Redd+</a> (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) plan to raise money through carbon credits. According to Redd+, <a href=\"http://www.un-redd.org/AboutREDD/tabid/102614/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">global deforestation accounts for nearly 20% of all CO2 emissions</a>. Under the Redd scheme – proposed by Papua New Guinea and others in 2005 – developing countries are paid for protecting their forests.</p><p>In preserving the forests of Bale, Tadesse estimates that the PFM scheme could produce 18m tonnes of tradable carbon over the next 20 years. A carbon credit currently sells for $5 a tonne. Tadesse, however, says any money from carbon credits would be a bonus, but not central to the viability of the project in Bale.</p><p>A new report, <a href=\"http://rovingambassadorjagdeo.org/en/new-report\" title=\"\">Rediscovering Ambition on Forests</a>, by Bharrat Jagdeo, former president of Guyana and a roving ambassador for the Three Basins Initiative, calls on rich countries to invest in forest conservation schemes. The report estimates that $29bn in incentive payments could halve annual deforestation across the 26 net deforesting countries of the <a href=\"http://rovingambassadorjagdeo.org/what-we-are-doing/three-basins-initiative\" title=\"\">Three Basins</a> (Amazon basin, Congo basin and south-east Asia). It warns that without commitment to forest preservation now, it will be impossible to stabilise the world's climate within 2° above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>• This article was amended on 16 April 2013. The original said the PFM scheme could produce 80m tonnes of tradable carbon over the next 20 years.

We won't know until the end of May, but the field of candidates narrowed last week. Of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/jan/08/world-trade-organisation-director-general-candidates\" title=\"\">nine original nominees</a>, four – the candidates from <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_alankyerematen_ghana.pdf\" title=\"\">Ghana</a> (pdf), <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_aminamohamed_kenya_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Kenya</a> (pdf), <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_anabel_gonzalez_costarica_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Costa Rica</a> (pdf) and <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_ahmadhindawi_jordan_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Jordan</a> (pdf) – have been knocked out of the running, the WTO <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news13_e/dgsel__12apr13_e.htm\" title=\"\">announced on Friday</a>. A second culling this month will eliminate three candidates, leaving a final two to compete for the top post.</p><p></p><p>With Africa and the Middle East out of the race, the next WTO director general will come from either Latin America or Asia-Pacific. But though geography is certainly a factor in this race, for many trade observers the key question is which candidate is most likely to deliver some sort of positive outcome for the struggling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/03/doha-round-trade-talks-explainer\" title=\"\">Doha round</a> trade talks. Here's a rundown, in alphabetical order, of the nominees still in contention.</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_robertoazevedo_brazil_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Roberto Azevêdo</a> (pdf), Brazil</h2><p>Azevêdo, who has served as Brazil's ambassador to the WTO since 2008, is a popular and charismatic figure in the Geneva headquarters, but he's less well known in wider diplomatic circles. Azevêdo is the only candidate still in the running who has never held the post of trade minister. That has led some observers to wonder whether he has the kind of high-level political pull that might be needed to finalise a Doha agreement. But Brazil has a powerful presence at the WTO and Latin America has never been represented in the director general's office.</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_bark_korea_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Taeho Bark</a> (pdf), South Korea</h2><p></p><p>Bark, South Korea's trade minister, is a long shot, given his lack of experience at WTO headquarters. But Bark's trade credentials are sound: he was Korea's lead negotiator on the country's free trade agreement with the US and holds a PhD in economics from the <a href=\"http://www.wisc.edu/\" title=\"\">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. Two factors count against him, however. The first is geography: South Korea, as a member of the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>, is no longer considered a developing country, and one of Bark's fellow Koreans, Ban Ki-moon, is already the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sg/\" title=\"\">head of the UN</a>. Secondly, Bark's strong stance in favour of regional and bilateral trade agreements could cause concern among Geneva's firmly multilateralist trade delegates.</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_herminioblanco_mexico_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Herminio Blanco</a> (pdf), Mexico</h2><p></p><p>Blanco, who served as Mexico's trade minister from 1994 to 2000, brings an outsider's experience to the race. He was Mexico's lead negotiator on both the <a href=\"http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/en/view.aspx\" title=\"\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact5_e.htm\" title=\"\">Uruguay round</a>, the negotiations that led to the creation of the WTO in January 1995. He holds a PhD in economics from the <a href=\"http://www.uchicago.edu/\" title=\"\">University of Chicago</a>, but has spent most of the decade working in the private sector. This has led some observers to wonder whether he has enough technical knowledge of the negotiations to be able to help bring the Doha round talks to a close. Plus, he will have to vie with Azevêdo of Brazil to win the votes of the WTO's Latin American delegates. That could prove to be his undoing.</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_timgroser_newzealand_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Tim Groser</a> (pdf), New Zealand</h2><p></p><p>Groser, New Zealand's trade minister, is a solid contender, even though he hails from a rich country that has already supplied a WTO director general (<a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/dg_e/mm_e.htm\" title=\"\">Mike Moore</a>, who held the post from 1999 to 2002). Groser earned the respect of many trade delegates when, as New Zealand's ambassador to the WTO, he chaired the Doha round negotiations on rules (2002-03) and agriculture (2004-05), which are notoriously complex and politically loaded. Groser's knowledge of the intricacies of the Doha talks may be unsurpassed by the other candidates; geography is his greatest challenge.</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_maripangestu_indonesia_e.pdf\" title=\"\">Mari Pangestu</a> (pdf), Indonesia</h2><p></p><p>The only woman left in the contest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/mar/25/doha-trade-talks-food-price-wto\" title=\"\">Pangestu</a> served as Indonesia's trade minister from 2004 to 2011. A formidable contender, she has been campaigning hard for the post, making stops in capitals the world over. With a PhD in economics from the <a href=\"http://www.ucdavis.edu/\" title=\"\">University of California, Davis</a>, she is certainly no slouch when it comes to technical trade issues. But for Pangestu, the geography card cuts both ways: she hails from one of the world's biggest developing countries, but her region, south-east Asia, has already supplied one WTO director general – <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/dg_e/sp_e.htm\" title=\"\">Supachai Panitchpakdi</a> of Thailand, who held the post from 2002 to 2005. If the contest comes down to geography alone, this could count against her.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/trade-and-development\">Trade and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/wto\">WTO</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/internationaltrade\">International trade</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paige-mcclanahan\">Paige McClanahan</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As I have done for my interviews with the likes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/mar/16/climate-change-al-gore\">Al Gore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/oct/06/bill-mckibben-keystone-pipeline-oil\">Bill McKibben</a> and James Lovelock (in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/mar/29/james-lovelock\">2010</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-fracking-greens-climate\">2012</a>), I have taken the time to transcribe the full interview so readers can see what Grantham said in the kind of detail that the print edition of the Guardian can't provide. The interview lasted three hours, so I have split the transcript in two. I will publish <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/apr/16/jeremy-grantham-food-oil-capitalism\">part two tomorrow</a>, but here's part one...</p><p>Jeremy Grantham on why he has stepped up his environmental activities:</p><blockquote><p>It's data driven. We [the <a href=\"http://www.granthamfoundation.org/\">Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment</a>] were gracefully moving into the environment, save these animals and habitats, and all these good things, then the data on resources - starting about four years ago – made me realise that some of these were really urgent. That we were already entering a food crisis, for example. This time last year I thought it was clear from the data that we were already five years into a food crisis and it is highly unlikely to go away. And unless we get our act together it is likely to become a cascading problem.</p></blockquote><p>On how much time we have to tackle the world's environmental problems:</p><blockquote><p>We're already in a bad place. We're on a sliding scale. The language \"it's too late\" is very unsuitable for most environmental issues. It's too late for the dodo and for people who've starved to death already, but it's not too late to prevent an even bigger crisis. The sooner we act on the environment, the better. The sooner we cut off the carbon dioxide going into the air, etc. The worse accidents we will prevent from happening are 20, 30, 40 years from now. The same applies to food. The faster we act to improve the situation, the fewer Africans – North Africans, in particular – will come to grief. What is happening through the market mechanism is that the rich countries, by being unnecessarily sloppy – and by the Chinese getting richer in a real hurry and eating more meat – we are pricing up grain so that the poor are getting hungry. It's hard to see this stopping in the immediate future. It's also very hard to see the poor and hungry getting richer at the same speed as the way we are driving up the price of grain.</p></blockquote><p>On feeding a growing human population:</p><blockquote><p>There is a stretching disparity between the haves and have nots. It's not the win-win of globalisation that we all grew up with studying in Econ 101. The irony is that as China gets richer, it burns more coal. They put pressure on the global environment and on global grain prices. So in order to give them a nice middle class, variegated diet, they could cause poorer Asians and Africans to starve. There is no mechanism to prevent that. Egypt runs a trade deficit. Their population is programmed to grow dramatically. Three million at the time of Napoleon. Eighty-three million, said their standard when they marched into the Olympic Games last year. And they're on their way to 140m. They've always been very efficient, but they can't feed much more than half their people. The price of grain from about 2002-2008 – a tiny window – tripled. Why did it grow so sharply? We knew population was growing, but it was growing steadily, if dramatically. When I was born there were two billion, now there are seven billion. It's the kind of curve than anyone in finance would look at and jump nervously, when you see an exponential curve like that. That's one factor, but nothing particular to the period of 2002-2008…</p></blockquote><p>On the rising price of oil:</p><blockquote><p>…2002 was a nothing year. The only numbers I was paying attention to in 2002 was for oil. A little wheel was turning at the back of my brain that noted that oil was beginning to act differently. Our firm specialises in the study of investment bubbles. We have the best data. Over the years, we have put together a database that has 330 bubbles of which about 40 are really important ones. What we found about the important bubbles is that every single one had burst completely back to the original trend. Three years up to something triple, and then three years down. They actually tend to go down a little more quickly than they went up, which is surprising. But they always broke. I used to specialise in asking financial audiences to give me an example of the paradigm shift, a major shift in a major financial asset class. And never was one offered. Six years ago I wrote about the paradigm shift in the New York Times. It had 100 years of oil prices – very volatile, but a very central, steady trend line of about 16 dollars a barrel in today's currency. But then around OPEC in 1972/3, the price trend leaps up to $36.</p></blockquote><p>On the unwillingness to process unpleasant data:</p><blockquote><p>I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise the trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful. There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data. In a bull market you want to believe good news. You don't want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff. You don't want to listen to the climate people who are telling you it is getting worse and even worse unless you do this and that. You want to listen to the good news. There were always people willing to tell you that smoking was OK and that stuff about cancer was exaggerated. There's a professor at MIT who defended tobacco who now defends carbon dioxide saying it seems to have lost its greenhouse effect, or whatever. And then there are the vested interests. They are the single most powerful force because you are dealing with an audience who wants to hear good news and into the stock market come all the bullish stock market giant firms telling you everything's fine because they love bull markets because they make a fortune. They don't even mind crashes because they don't do so badly there either. What they would die at is if the market went up at its long-term trend line at 1.8%, plus inflation, a year. But we're not going back to 2% growth. Maybe we'll do 1% and it will be reported as 1.5% and once again people don't want to hear that. They want to hear <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ben-bernanke\">Ben Bernanke</a>'s news that it should return to 3%...<br />Me calling bubbles correctly is all data driven and based on the optimism that is built into humans. Every time we see a bubble, we see an army of people screaming, \"No, no, it's not a bubble, everything is fine.\" We see the climate and scores of people screaming the same that everything is fine, or that it's a plot. It's par for the course. The general public don't want to hear it and will choose to listen to the optimistic interpretation. It's a real uphill struggle. You don't stop the bubble really until the damage is done. It goes so high that it can't sustain itself and just pops. And maybe that will happen here and our job is to try to do a better job than we did in the tech bubble.</p></blockquote><p>On climate sceptics:</p><blockquote><p>The misinformation machine is brilliant. As a propagandist myself [he has previously <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/can-jeremy-grantham-profit-from-ecological-mayhem.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\">described himself</a> as GMO's \"chief of propaganda\" in reference to his official title of \"chief investment strategist\"], I have nothing but admiration for their propaganda. [Laughs.] But the difference is that we have the facts behind our propaganda. They're in the \"screaming loudly\" rather than the \"fact based\" part of the exercise, because they don't have the facts. They are masters at manufacturing doubt. What I have noticed on the blogs and in the comments section under articles is that over several years, as the scientific evidence for climate change gets stronger, the tone of the sceptics is getting shriller and more vicious and nastier all the time. The equivalent on the other side is a weary resignation, sorrow and frustration and amazement that people on the other side can't look at the facts. The sceptics are getting angrier and more vicious every year despite the more storms we have, and the more mad crazy weather we have…<br />One of the problems is that typically you are not dealing with the facts. Putting in more facts makes the sceptics more angry. They have profound beliefs – as opposed to knowledge – that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks. So you have people who are very smart - even great analysts and hedge fund managers - who on paper know that their argument is wrong, but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians. Libertarians believe that any government interference is bad. Anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy. Their ideology is so strongly held that remarkably it's overcoming the facts. They are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts that they do not choose to accept philosophically. Laying down more facts just makes them more angry. You may win over a few neutrals. They are the people you can win over. But it's very hard to win over the hardcore sceptics, of which there are plenty.<br />We can try to bypass them on one level and we try to contest the political power of the sceptics. They are using money as well as propaganda to influence the politicians, particularly in America. It almost doesn't even exist in countries outside the US, UK and Australia. A cynic would say that the petrol-chemical industry also happens to be Anglo-Saxon. Where are the great oil companies based? They still have great power. The oil companies seem to have pulled back from directly supporting climate sceptics over the past few years because - in England, in particular - they were embarrassed and it became untenable to be so obvious. But they're still influential. You don't have go via back-channels any more, courtesy of the US Supreme Court, because it is completely legal for a corporation to invest tons of money in advertising programmes to say who is good and who is bad in a race for the Senate without even asking permission from the people who actually own the company. Corporations are treated as human beings and money is treated as having the right to speak. There's dark money and light money. The anonymity they adopt is legal. They don't have to say who their donors are. It is quite remarkable. And then you get the Something Something for the Environment, which are actually just sceptics funded by the bad guys. And then there are the thinktanks who have become propaganda-tanks. I used to respect the <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/\">Cato Institute</a> when it came out with reports on this, that and the other, and they have received a lot of hydrocarbon funding. But when the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/hacked-climate-science-emails\">University of East Anglia break-in</a> was engineered they had something like 20 press conferences the following month. The response to the break-in was almost immediate and co-ordinated. I don't think it was suspiciously rapid, but I do think it was unusually and unexpectedly rapid. It's very likely that it was simply a terrific response of their behalf. They moved very fast. The good guys are learning slowly, but surely, to step up their response time…<br />If you're saying something that people don't want to hear or accept, a significant proportion of them will reply with hostility. Not because they know the facts, or because they have researched it themselves, but because they're so psychologically involved in believing good news that they will oppose it with a reflex. In addition, if the solutions proposed sound like they involve the government, you will have all the political rightwing try to block it as a reflex, even if it means them overriding hard science, which is what's going on today. Changing people's minds is almost impossible, even among scientists. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck\">Max Planck</a> said, to paraphrase, that science advances one funeral at a time. You could add that economics advances the same way. You have to wait to get rid of the people who have career investment in a topic before a new generation can see the light.</p></blockquote><p>On the UK's unseasonably cold spring in 2013, and recent icy winters:</p><blockquote><p>The scientists are getting very concerned privately – they are conservative in public and have yet to write it up – that blocking processes are sticking in the system. The jet stream is behaving very strangely. One very senior atmospheric scientist said to me recently off the record that we are liable to wake up one day and find ourselves on the latitude – which we are in the UK – of Montreal. It's a liveable place, but not like London. They have underground tunnels because of their winters. The Gulf Stream is having a few wobbles, too, and the theory there is the melting in Greenland and the Arctic is creating a lot of cold, fresh water, which is a possible source for loss of power in the conductor, so it moves less warm water up from the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>On how he chooses where to spend his foundation's money:</p><blockquote><p>We don't fund the hard science of solar technology. That would take hundreds of millions. But what we are funding is bringing together the data and put it together and representing it conveniently to the outside world. And we want to train people with a good range of skills so they can produce good PhDs for the future at <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx\">LSE</a> and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange\">Imperial</a>. We also fund old-fashioned style investigative journalism which is dying out in newspapers because the newspaper industry has become incredibly tough. The first people to get fired were the environmental journalists. We had a <a href=\"http://www.granthamprize.org/\">prize for environmental journalism</a> which we brought in at the top of the market, but we discontinued it last year because there was basically no leverage left for the two-and-a-half environmental journalists left. All we were interested in was the net result of whether it could produce a more effective presentation of the facts. We got going in the nick of time to see that it could drag up environmental journalism, but then all the \"dragees\" were suddenly looking for different jobs, or put on different beats. Or that they were already working for the handful of independent investigative organisations. We fund about a dozen fledgling journalistic projects. Our argument was they are all fledgling so let's fund them all first, then winnow them down later – come back in 3-4 years and pick eight and, a couple of years later, pick five. In the end, it doesn't matter if there are one or two, but that they are the best. They whole point really is to allow these people to do their thing and to play to their skills and to pick the people who are highly motivated and very skilled. None of them would be very happy if we tried to tell them what precisely to do and we don't know what they should do.</p></blockquote><p>On assessing if the money his foundation spends has achieved its objectives:</p><blockquote><p>It's a great problem for philanthropists and NGOs. The problems where you can measure the impact are not common in the environmental field. If you can measure them, they tend to be over decades. One is the wildlife population of Namibia. That is by far and away the most successful [conservation project the foundation has funded], by the way. You can see the population of the various types of antelope have improved. But that is unusual. But the ones you feel are most important are the vaguest of them all. How do measure the shift in attitudes towards processing the data? There are guys working on studying the changes in attitudes in the media. But you have to take a leap of faith that they are smart and dedicated.</p></blockquote><p>On whether he tries to persuade other philanthropists to support his causes:</p><blockquote><p>No, I don't. We might discuss such things informally over lunch. There's a handful of hedge fund managers, mainly, who have decided to be aggressive about the environment, thank heavens. This doesn't exist in England where you could get them all on the finger of one hand. I can try to persuade them. I gave a talk in London recently at the head office of a major financial player and someone went to considerably effort to make sure a couple of hundred potential philanthropists and wealthy individuals were there for me to have a go at them. A lot of them left their business cards and if you do that you are kind of asking for trouble. [Laughs.] I believe the majority left their cards, which as things go, is a huge potential hit because even if you get one or two that could be significant. They were a receptive audience. I try to paint the picture of how I got to where I am [as an investor] and then of how fact based the issues appear to be to me. I now try to add my thoughts about food and the \"carbon math\"…</p></blockquote><p>On the \"carbon math\":</p><blockquote><p>…It's simple, comprehensible maths, as Bill McKibben <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\">explained in Rolling Stone</a> last year. There are five times the amount of proven carbon reserves as we can possibly allow to be burned if we want to remain under 2C of warming, which is now not even considered to be a safe margin. We must burn just a fifth of what's there. We will burn all the cheap, high-quality oil and gas, but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tarsands, or even third derivative, energy-intensive oil and gas, with fracking for shale gas on the boundary, then we're cooked, we're done for. Terrible consequences that we will lay at the door of our grandchildren. Some things might change very quickly, though. For example, the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster than the well-informed business man realises.</p></blockquote><p>On the falling costs of alternative energy: </p><blockquote><p>Read my next quarterly newsletter entitled, \"The Race of Our Lives\", [will be available <a href=\"http://www.gmo.com/America/\">here</a>] on why civilisations fall and why they've always fallen and why we may not because we have two advantages that they did not - a voluntary fall in fertility, which is just amazing, and alternative energy. Every wave of technology has seen an incremental increase in energy needed – steam engines, cars, air conditioning, iPads – they all add to our energy needs and mean we dig a deeper hole, but we feel we are making wonderful progress. But now we have a technology wave which protects us from needing to burn every last ton of coal. Solar, wind, biomass, intelligent grids, and storage - please, more storage - protect us. That is the best part of capitalism. The price of solar panels is now 25% of what it was two years ago and that's the bit people have missed. If these prices were to be held – they may not be – we are competitive, without a carbon tax, in the areas that have the sun - California, North Africa, Spain, etc. You can build a solar farm and it can be commercial. Meanwhile, the price of hydrocarbons are getting more expensive all the time, because you've extracted all the easy stuff first and with China rising and still growing at 7% a year. And that's just China. Don't forget India which actually has more coal power plants down to be built on the books at the moment than China. Now you start to get an idea of, wow, why this does not compute. If it computes, it's only at the enormous increase in cost of digging and shipping coal. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, solar and wind power are getting cheaper and cheaper. Those lines are going to cross big time in the next 20 years. There is no such thing as \"locked in and committed\" because you can reverse. They might build a few more coal-fired plants, but then they will stop completely. The pay-off for China of getting out of the way of those lines crossing is so great.</p></blockquote><p>On why China is his big hope:</p><blockquote><p>China is my secret weapon. I call them the Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue. They have the capital. They have an embarrassment of capital – 50% of their GDP is capital investment. We have a shortage of capital and also have debts. Their problem is how to invest all that capital. My partners worry all the time about them wasting their money. What better programme could they possibly have, with huge social pay-off, than a massive replacement of sustainable energy? When you think what it would mean to them – it would get rid of their pollution – it makes sense. Because of that pollution, they announced recently an incredible increase of 65% in their plans to install by 2015 – just three short years away – 36GW, which is equivalent to 20 vast, state-of-art coal plants, of solar. Throw in wind, too. And, by the way, we will have many breakthroughs in storage. If I had to make a bet, I would say that's the most promising, important breakthrough of the next several years. Everyone is working on this. If you have a big smart grid – and all the desert of Xinjiang and all the wind of Inner Mongolia – and it's all swirling around with relatively little loss and you have a grid smart enough to go in there Chinese-style and turn your fridge off for half an hour to save energy, and do this and do that, you don't need nearly the back-up. The bad guys will tell you that you need 100% back-up and messianic environmentalists will tell you that you need 0%. But maybe 20% back-up will be needed as everyone is working on storage. I'm certain it will happen. Some technologies take time then go, \"Bang!\". Look at video conferencing. It has been around forever and the quality was terrible. But now it is so clear and instant. Technology has a habit of boring you to death and disappointing you for 20 years then suddenly it delivers a new world…<br />I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class. And that is huge. They know this is serious. They can calculate the social threat of getting this pollution, weather instability, water out of control. And they are acting much faster now than we are. They have it within their capabilities of coming back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence – all alternative and sustainable forever. They have an embarrassment of capital. We have an embarrassment of debt. So they can set a stunning pace, which they are doing. And they could crank it up. To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans for alternative energy - energy security, reducing pollution and low cost. They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they will be the terror of the capitalist system. With low energy and low labour, that's the ball game. Five years into a 25-year programme and any capitalist will be urging their government to copy them.</p></blockquote><p>On the Scandinavian countries:</p><blockquote><p>I am inspired by [them]. They have to cope with short-term election cycles and a parliamentary system and all four of them nevertheless act responsibly, not just on alternative energy and environmental issues, but also on social issues that matter. They are, by and large, models of good behaviour. They say in America to me what's the solution to all this, I say cede your government to Denmark. [Laughs]. They are good enough that they would get the job done.</p></blockquote><p>On environmentalism's track record of making predictions:</p><blockquote><p>Go and read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth\">Limits to Growth</a>, which I did recently. They pretty much predicted doom and gloom 20 years from now. They have been grossly misinterpreted and are pretty much on schedule. There are details that are over and under, but it is amazingly accurate. The <a href=\"http://ophuls.org/William_Ophuls/Home.html\">William Ophuls</a> model is that we are hard-wired to collapse. Given half a chance we will over-reach. We are over-confident that we will solve every problem. But we will leave it too late and we will crash. All the confidence that people try to give you – the \"infinite capacity of the human brain\", unquote – all of that hinges on the apparent infinite supply of hydrocarbons. No civilisation looked durable and resilient until coal and then we acquired this amazing power. We are now coming to the end of that era. If we don't use that window to fix it and have a sustainable replacement, we are toast. Don't worry about peak oil, worry about peak temperature. All our flora and fauna has thrived in the last 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age, a period which has seen unbelievable stable weather by long-term standards. Now it is becoming unstable. If you drive the temperature above 40C, well-known brands of corn will not produce. They just stop. You might be able to twist and turn and get it to produce at 41C, and you might move further north in latitude, but temperatures rises are very bad news for grain. The wider point is it [temperature rise] is generally bad for everything that evolved in one stable environment. It has no resilience to produce outside the temperatures experiences during this 10,000 year period. Quite a few grains are now topping out in terms of productivity. I look around and I say just look at the food-producing problems we face. In fact, let's make it even simpler: look at the grain-producing problems we face around the world. We've just had three consecutive monster-bad grain harvests. Not one of those three poor harvests was more likely than a one-in-25-year harvest. But the terrible thing is they went, \"whack, whack, whack\". I took some grief when I wrote about the first one and said next year was bound to be less bad, but the next year became a monster. I've done more research and reading in the last two years than I ever did at college. I've read all the classics. All the limits to growth, all the end of civilisations stuff, all the peak everything stuff, all the soil destruction stuff.</p></blockquote><p>On confronting our environmental problems:</p><blockquote><p>Asking, \"Are we too late?\", is not the logic for this problem. It is too late for the dodo. It is too late for the one third of arable land that we have destroyed in 10,000 years. It's too late for 10% of global biodiversity, and almost certainly another 10%, and 50/50 for yet another 10% after that. But it would be nice to end up with a planet that we can still relate to, that still has a fairly handsome biodiversity. We can still do that. There is one chance that the real pessimists are right. The chance that on our way to a 4-8C rise, and a 10-15ft rise in the oceans, which is probably what's going to happen over the next two centuries, that things will get worse before they get better, because there is inertia built into the system. You can easily imagine resource wars breaking out unless we put our best foot forward on alternative energy. This would buy us time for everything else to be solved. If you can become energy sustainable in the next 40 years and suck up the pain that will have been paid by then, then you have probably bought the time for another 40 years to transfer the whole of global agriculture into a fully sustainable system before we run out of the resources to run old-fashioned agriculture. And if you do that then, in turn, you have probably bought enough time to deal with the intractable long-term issue of metals, which are entropy writ large. No matter how careful you are with them, they slip through your fingers. In the end, you will need to use organic replacements, which will take a long, long time [to develop]. We'd better start working on it now, but not too many are and they're not getting much funding. You've got to get the population down and you've got to ignore the Economist magazine and others talking about rising population as a terrible economic problem. It is a necessary, short-term, intermediate pain to pay for the absolute minimum hope of survival, which is a gracefully declining population, because if you don't do that you will have a rapidly imploding population one day.</p></blockquote><p><em>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/apr/16/jeremy-grantham-food-oil-capitalism\">part two tomorrow</a>: Jeremy Grantham on genetically modified food, capitalism vs the environment, and why he still invests in oil and gas</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change\">Climate change</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange\">Climate change</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change-scepticism\">Climate change scepticism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/natural-resources-and-development\">Natural resources and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector\">Financial sector</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/population\">Population</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/food\">Food</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil\">Oil</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oil\">Oil</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil-sands\">Oil sands</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/shale-gas\">Shale gas and fracking</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy\">Renewable energy</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/leohickman\">Leo Hickman</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But experts have warned that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/world/africa/as-coal-boosts-mozambique-the-rural-poor-are-left-behind.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\" title=\"\">economic growth is no guarantee of poverty alleviation</a>.</p><p></p><p>A separate <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/africaspulse\" title=\"\">report by the World Bank</a> predicted that sub-Saharan Africa's expansion would be 4.9%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, again comfortably outstripping the global average. Increased investment, high commodity prices and a recovery in the world economy are likely to sustain the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august\" title=\"\">narrative of \"Africa rising\"</a>, the bank said.</p><p></p><p>Foreign direct investment inflows to sub-Saharan Africa are projected to increase to record levels each year over the next three years, reaching $54bn (£35bn) by 2015. This compares with $37.7bn last year.</p><p></p><p>The report said a decade of strong growth had reduced poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, with provisional data showing that between 1996 and 2010, the percentage of Africans living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 58% to 48.5%.</p><p></p><p>The mineral sectors in countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone should continue to attract investment.</p><p></p><p>But World Bank economists cautioned that high inequality and a dependence on mining and mineral exports in many countries had actually dampened the poverty-reducing effect of income growth. Countries rich in natural resources, such as Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria, performed less well than those lacking this apparent head start.</p><p></p><p>Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, said: \"While the broad picture emerging from the data is that Africa's economies have been expanding robustly and that poverty is coming down, the aggregate hides a great deal of diversity in performance, even among Africa's faster growers.\"</p><p></p><p>The World Bank said better administration of mineral wealth, development of agriculture and a careful managing of rapid urbanisation would help governments to lift more people out of poverty. \"Better governance will need to underpin efforts to make growth more poverty reducing,\" the report said.</p><p></p><p>Infrastructure development was vital to ensure the strong pace of economic growth, for example in east Africa's oil and gas sectors, it said. A <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/uk-mozambique-infrastructure-idUKBRE93F0R020130416\" title=\"\">report by Reuters</a> this week highlighted how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/apr/13/mozambique-mining-hiv-infection-rate\" title=\"\">coal mining in Mozambique</a> has been hit by weak railways and ports.</p><p></p><p>Africa's golden decade can be matched closely to China's soaring demand for commodities; Chinese demand accounts for half of many industrial metals exported from Africa. This has raised fears that the continent is overly dependent on the relationship and vulnerable to a sudden downturn.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/26/central-african-republic-turmoil-rebels\" title=\"\">Instability in the Central African Republic</a>, Mali and Togo, the financial crisis in Europe and volatility in food prices are other potential stumbling blocks.</p><p></p><p>But looking to the future, the World Bank noted: \"It is expected that by 2020, only four or five countries in the region will not be involved in mineral exploitation of some kind, such is Africa's abundance of natural resources.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/trade-and-development\">Trade and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/private-sector\">Private sector</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/natural-resources-and-development\">Natural resources and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa\">Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank\">World Bank</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics\">Economics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy\">Global economy</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But experts have warned that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/world/africa/as-coal-boosts-mozambique-the-rural-poor-are-left-behind.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\" title=\"\">economic growth is no guarantee of poverty alleviation</a>.</p><p></p><p>A separate <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/africaspulse\" title=\"\">report by the World Bank</a> predicted that sub-Saharan Africa's expansion would be 4.9%, 5.1% and 5.2% in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, again comfortably outstripping the global average. Increased investment, high commodity prices and a recovery in the world economy are likely to sustain the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21572377-african-lives-have-already-greatly-improved-over-past-decade-says-oliver-august\" title=\"\">narrative of \"Africa rising\"</a>, the bank said.</p><p></p><p>Foreign direct investment inflows to sub-Saharan Africa are projected to increase to record levels each year over the next three years, reaching $54bn (£35bn) by 2015. This compares with $37.7bn last year.</p><p></p><p>The report said a decade of strong growth had reduced poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, with provisional data showing that between 1996 and 2010, the percentage of Africans living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 58% to 48.5%.</p><p></p><p>The mineral sectors in countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone should continue to attract investment.</p><p></p><p>But World Bank economists cautioned that high inequality and a dependence on mining and mineral exports in many countries had actually dampened the poverty-reducing effect of income growth. Countries rich in natural resources, such as Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria, performed less well than those lacking this apparent head start.</p><p></p><p>Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, said: \"While the broad picture emerging from the data is that Africa's economies have been expanding robustly and that poverty is coming down, the aggregate hides a great deal of diversity in performance, even among Africa's faster growers.\"</p><p></p><p>The World Bank said better administration of mineral wealth, development of agriculture and a careful managing of rapid urbanisation would help governments to lift more people out of poverty. \"Better governance will need to underpin efforts to make growth more poverty reducing,\" the report said.</p><p></p><p>Infrastructure development was vital to ensure the strong pace of economic growth, for example in east Africa's oil and gas sectors, it said. A <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/uk-mozambique-infrastructure-idUKBRE93F0R020130416\" title=\"\">report by Reuters</a> this week highlighted how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/apr/13/mozambique-mining-hiv-infection-rate\" title=\"\">coal mining in Mozambique</a> has been hit by weak railways and ports.</p><p></p><p>Africa's golden decade can be matched closely to China's soaring demand for commodities; Chinese demand accounts for half of many industrial metals exported from Africa.

He told the local press that the government would identify all those schools that fail to meet standards and close them to stop the exploitation of children.</p><p></p><p>In the coming months, the Senegalese government is expected to unveil an ambitious plan that will regulate the Qur'anic schools, known as <em>daaras</em>, and put an end to children begging on the streets by the end of next year.</p><p></p><p>\"The plan hopes to rejuvenate a law drafted in 2007 that regulates the daaras<em> </em>by introducing operating norms and standards, as well as evaluating and identifying daaras<em> </em>that need to be shut down,\" said Amsatou Sow Sidibe, a presidential adviser.</p><p></p><p>Two other laws on child begging and child trafficking have rarely been enforced because of contradictions in the legal system and pressure from religious quarters that still wield considerable political and economical influence within the country.</p><p></p><p>\"[Child] traffickers take refuge behind article 245 of the penal code, which contradicts the 2005 law and states that soliciting alms as part of religious traditions is not an act of begging. What's more, there is intense lobbying and pressure from some Qur'anic masters whenever the government takes drastic measures against child trafficking,\" said Sidibe.</p><p></p><p>Parents sending their children away with marabouts in an informal system known as <em>confiage</em> is not a new phenomenon in Senegal. The parents see this as an opportunity for the child to learn about Islam but poverty often plays an important role in this decision. The victims of the fire were aged between seven and 12, and came from the Kolda region, one of the poorest areas of Senegal.</p><p></p><p>\"Senegal allocates just 0.8% of its budget to the ministry of family, which is responsible for social safety nets,\" said Jean Lieby, head of child protection for Unicef Senegal. \"Unicef is piloting a 'cash transfer' programme that aims to give impoverished parents grants so they can feed, clothe and protect their children from abuse, exploitation and trafficking.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel search and rescue type operation, which is also funded by Unicef, in urban centres including Dakar and Kolda identifies vulnerable children and reintegrates them with their families, many of whom have no idea of their child's suffering.</p><p></p><p>Mariama Diao, who sent her son, Mamadou, away with a travelling marabout from Guinea-Bissau, only found out how her son was suffering when a talibé<em> </em>from the same daara<em> </em>in Dakar told her that Mamadou had run away.</p><p></p><p>\"We sent Mamadou away with the marabout<em> </em>to learn about Islam, but we didn't hear from him in four years,\" said Diao, from Guiré Yéro, a small village near the border with Guinea-Bissau. \"The last time the marabout<em> </em>came back to the village, he told us Mamadou was doing fine, that he was not just begging, but also learning the Qur'an, even though he didn't know where Mamadou was,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Marabouts who mistreat children in this way should be punished with the full force of the law,\" Diao added.</p><p></p><p>Mamadou was eventually found and returned to his family by La Lumière, a local NGO that reintegrates children into their communities. According to the NGO, some parents had been told by marabouts<em> </em>that their children were dead when they were not.</p><p></p><p>The mistreatment of children has prompted some religious leaders to speak up against child begging. Just weeks before the fire, a highly respected relgious leader had told parents to stop sending their children away with marabouts in an article in the daily Le Quotidien that was seen as the first time such a high-ranking <em>Khalife </em>had<em> </em>spoken out publicly on the issue of talibés.</p><p></p><p>\"Stop sending your children to study outside of your locality. There, they are good for begging, hard work and beatings,\" said Khalife Thierno Amadou Baldé, the 70-year-old spiritual leader of the Peuhl people.

He told the local press that the government would identify all those schools that fail to meet standards and close them to stop the exploitation of children.</p><p></p><p>In the coming months, the Senegalese government is expected to unveil an ambitious plan that will regulate the Qur'anic schools, known as <em>daaras</em>, and put an end to children begging on the streets by the end of next year.</p><p></p><p>\"The plan hopes to rejuvenate a law drafted in 2007 that regulates the daaras<em> </em>by introducing operating norms and standards, as well as evaluating and identifying daaras<em> </em>that need to be shut down,\" said Amsatou Sow Sidibe, a presidential adviser.</p><p></p><p>Two other laws on child begging and child trafficking have rarely been enforced because of contradictions in the legal system and pressure from religious quarters that still wield considerable political and economical influence within the country.</p><p></p><p>\"[Child] traffickers take refuge behind article 245 of the penal code, which contradicts the 2005 law and states that soliciting alms as part of religious traditions is not an act of begging. What's more, there is intense lobbying and pressure from some Qur'anic masters whenever the government takes drastic measures against child trafficking,\" said Sidibe.</p><p></p><p>Parents sending their children away with marabouts in an informal system known as <em>confiage</em> is not a new phenomenon in Senegal. The parents see this as an opportunity for the child to learn about Islam but poverty often plays an important role in this decision. The victims of the fire were aged between seven and 12, and came from the Kolda region, one of the poorest areas of Senegal.</p><p></p><p>\"Senegal allocates just 0.8% of its budget to the ministry of family, which is responsible for social safety nets,\" said Jean Lieby, head of child protection for Unicef Senegal. \"Unicef is piloting a 'cash transfer' programme that aims to give impoverished parents grants so they can feed, clothe and protect their children from abuse, exploitation and trafficking.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel search and rescue type operation, which is also funded by Unicef, in urban centres including Dakar and Kolda identifies vulnerable children and reintegrates them with their families, many of whom have no idea of their child's suffering.</p><p></p><p>Mariama Diao, who sent her son, Mamadou, away with a travelling marabout from Guinea-Bissau, only found out how her son was suffering when a talibé<em> </em>from the same daara<em> </em>in Dakar told her that Mamadou had run away.</p><p></p><p>\"We sent Mamadou away with the marabout<em> </em>to learn about Islam, but we didn't hear from him in four years,\" said Diao, from Guiré Yéro, a small village near the border with Guinea-Bissau. \"The last time the marabout<em> </em>came back to the village, he told us Mamadou was doing fine, that he was not just begging, but also learning the Qur'an, even though he didn't know where Mamadou was,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Marabouts who mistreat children in this way should be punished with the full force of the law,\" Diao added.</p><p></p><p>Mamadou was eventually found and returned to his family by La Lumière, a local NGO that reintegrates children into their communities. According to the NGO, some parents had been told by marabouts<em> </em>that their children were dead when they were not.</p><p></p><p>The mistreatment of children has prompted some religious leaders to speak up against child begging. Just weeks before the fire, a highly respected relgious leader had told parents to stop sending their children away with marabouts in an article in the daily Le Quotidien that was seen as the first time such a high-ranking <em>Khalife </em>had<em> </em>spoken out publicly on the issue of talibés.</p><p></p><p>\"Stop sending your children to study outside of your locality. There, they are good for begging, hard work and beatings,\" said Khalife Thierno Amadou Baldé, the 70-year-old spiritual leader of the Peuhl people. His intervention has been seen as possibly heralding a shift back to the old system of confiage, where Qur'anic schools were part of the village and parents could supervise their children. However, such alignment between political and religious powers has drawn suspicion.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/senegal\">Senegal</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa\">Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/child-labour\">Child labour</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection\">Child protection</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children\">Children</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/misha-hussain\">Misha Hussain</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said recently: \"To deliver bold solutions on climate change, we need to listen to and engage broader and more diverse audiences.\" This is what the <a href=\"http://www.connect4climate.org\" title=\"\">Connect4Climate</a> (C4C) team has set out to do since the programme began in 2011.</p><p>C4C is a global partnership programme dedicated to climate change and supported by the World Bank, Italy's environment ministry and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). We operate as a coalition of more than 150 knowledge partners ranging from major UN agencies to academic institutions to media organisations and NGOs.</p><p>Our aim is to convene different organisations, groups and individuals who wouldn't normally speak to one another, around the table to talk about climate change. The first audience we had to convince of the merits of building relationships and networks outside of those which seem immediately relevant, was our own within the World Bank.</p><p>To initiate constructive conversations about climate change, we had to admit that creative ideas do not only come from economists. And unlike some of the prevailing structures within development, we needed to create an open platform that is genuinely equal. C4C thus was made a coalition, not a World Bank dominated initiative.</p><p>C4C has worked with many disparate groups. Recently, we partnered with the first Italian carbon neutral private sector firm Alcantara and co-hosted a series of panel discussions on sustainability featuring high-profile individuals from architecture, design, fashion, social advocacy, corporate social responsibility, entertainment, and the arts. Some of the 300,000 people who attended Milan design week attended the debates and others followed the live stream or tweets. Milan was chosen to target the entertainment industry – to influence the influencers.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.connect4climate.org/blog/alcantaradialogues\" title=\"\">Alcantara dialogues/Connect4Climate: re-think, redesign, renew</a> discussion series has led to multiple creative projects. Here are a few lessons that are worth sharing from these experiences:</p><h2>Partnership across sectors calls for humility</h2><p>Whether we are trying to engage with small grassroots climate change groups or with leaders in fashion and architecture, it is important to be positive about the work of others. People are more open to hearing what part they have to play if they do not feel that they are being judged or patronised. We as development professionals must start by giving credit where credit is due and acknowledge the pressures that various organisations face within their own environments. At C4C, we have tried not to fixate on any organisation's past failures if we can see that they are keen to start taking steps in the right direction. We focus instead on empowering them so that they do the right thing.</p><h2>Scaremongering doesn't help</h2><p>We empower individuals and organisations by talking about small actions that lead to positive change. Giving people options make them feel empowered. That is not to say that the campaign organisations that impress upon us the urgency of the climate change situation – particularly for the world's poorest – shouldn't do what they do. We realise that our power lies in our ability to convene a diversity of players around a common cause. The idea is to not replicate any organisation but acknowledge the value that all organisations can bring to the table. A more pragmatic approach is key to starting new conversations with new people.</p><h2>Extensive research is the only way to find out what tools work</h2><p>Focusing simply on Twitter and Facebook would have meant limited reach in the developing world. In Africa, radio has been the most effective medium to get the climate change message out, and equally to hear back from communities. Even where internet connectivity isn't the dominant problem, there are other social networks that are used as our work with South Africa-based Mxit – Africa's largest social network with 50 million users across the continent has shown us. Few things just 'go viral', it takes  research and hard work to understand your target audience.</p><h2>Don't reinvent the wheel</h2><p>In addition to running competitions that reward winners by giving them the opportunity to have their voices heard, we decided C4C needed to be a platform that pointed interested groups in the direction of existing knowledge, rather than replicating it. The question we are always asking ourselves is: 'what is it that we are missing?'</p><p>There are three prevailing truths that shape the work we do: the first is that there have been far too may COP summits. We are now heading towards COP19, without a binding global deal on climate. The second is that no one group has the silver bullet to address climate change. Lastly, no single organisation has nearly enough resources to tackle the issue on their own.</p><p>What this means then is that we need a new way of thinking about and framing the climate change discourse. We have chosen to prioritise capacity building and creative cross-sector collaboration. If the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/connect4climate\" title=\"\">Alcantara dialogues</a> are anything to go by, more people care about the future of the planet than we give them credit for, and seemingly unusual suspects are willing to put time and resources into seeking solutions.

Seems like a lot? Let me put this into perspective.

And how this spending is more justified than, say, investing in renewable energy, health care and education.</p><p>Consider this: every day <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/mdg/index_childmortality.htm\" title=\"\">19,000 children</a> under the age of five die around the world, mainly from preventable causes. The costs of reducing mortality rates by two-thirds, improving maternal health as well as combating Aids, malaria and other major diseases, are estimated <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/social/poverty/50463407.pdf\" title=\"\">to be $60bn</a>  (£39bn) a year. Meanwhile, $60bn is approximately the cost of buying and operating two nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The estimated total cost of achieving the six of the UN's <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> related to poverty, education and health – eradicating hunger, universal primary education, child mortality reduction, disease prevention– is $120bn annually in additional resources, a fraction of what is spent every year on militaries.</p><p>We at Greenpeace join the outcry against excessive military spending. Rather than spending money preparing for conflict, governments must focus their efforts on avoiding conflict and achieving sustainability and equity in their countries.</p><p>Climate change is a major driver of conflict and threat to international and national peace and security, putting billions of people's future in jeopardy. It is not often the case that we find ourselves in agreement with the military and intelligence communities, but when it comes  to the security implications of climate change, it seems we may have some similar concerns. In May 2012, <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=116192\" title=\"\">US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said</a>: \"Climate change has a dramatic impact on national security: rising sea levels, to severe droughts, to the melting of the polar caps, to more frequent and devastating natural disasters all raise demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.\"</p><p>These impacts of climate change are already being felt. Climate change and a carbon-intensive economy are already responsible for <a href=\"http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CVM_RELEASE_FINAL_ENGLISH.pdf\" title=\"\">5 million deaths</a> each year. By 2030, deaths could total 100 million. This is already costing <a href=\"http://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CVM2ndEd-FrontMatter.pdf\" title=\"\">about $1.2tn</a> a year, which could double by 2030 if global temperatures are allowed to rise. So why is it that governments carry on spending $105bn a year on nuclear weapons, rather than diverting the amounts to mitigating the risks of the true WMD – \"weather of mass destruction\"?</p><p>Governments intent on spending taxpayers' money are fuelling the problem, rather than the solution. A <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr1393.htm\" title=\"\">new report</a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveals that worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels total $1.9tn annually. Almost 9% of all annual country budgets are spent on supporting oil, natural gas and coal industries. Subsidies result in overconsumption of dirty energy, which fuels climate change. Eliminating subsidies would lead to a 13% decrease in global energy related CO2 emissions.</p><p>Moving <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/Campaign-reports/Climate-Reports/Point-of-No-Return/\" title=\"Greenpeace report\">away from fossil fuels</a> and investing in renewable energy is the world's best hope for avoiding the most serious impacts of climate change. In 2011, renewable energy provided more than 30% of new electricity production globally, up from less than 5% in 2005. In 2012, investments in renewable energy approximated $250bn – which employed 5 million people worldwide, a win-win situation. An <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/\" title=\"Greenpeace energy report\">energy revolution</a> in the power sector – moving away from climate-destroying fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power – would require additional annual investments of $280bn – investments that would not only pay back financially but would significantly reduce the security threats resulting from climate change.</p><p>More than $3.5tn is spent annually on the world's military and on subsidising fossil fuels. We can no longer stand by and allow governments to spend recklessly on the wrong things, when so many right things remain neglected.

The solutions below are some exceptional examples of grassroots level innovations. The question is – how many other potential world changing solutions have remained in obscurity at source, never replicating sufficiently to make a significant change?</p><p><strong>Combating climate change, water and food security in arid regions</strong></p><p>A single farmer in Burkina Faso started an <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa\" title=\"\">agricultural revolution in the semi-desert area where he lives</a>, which has spread to other parts of Burkina Faso and into neighbouring countries. The 'tree farming' approach he championed (by personally travelling to around 100 other villages by motorbike) has re-greened millions of acres in the dry Sahel region; enough so that the effects can be seen from outer space. The innovation: pits which were dug to concentrate rainfall onto crop roots were made larger, and manure was added to them during the dry season. Tree seeds in the manure sprouted with the crops and these tree saplings increased soil fertility, shielded crops from overwhelming heat, and acted as windbreaks. At the macro level, areas with trees are more efficient for water harvesting than areas without. Water tables in the areas with tree farming have risen since the method gained popularity, despite a growing population.</p><p><strong>System of rice intensification: increasing crop yields while reducing water demand and chemical usage. </strong></p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution\" title=\"\">recent article</a>, another agricultural approach was explored in depth: the system of rice intensification (SRI). Through applying zero cost techniques to rice farming, small scale rice farmers have increased their crop yields by anywhere from 30-50% while reducing water and chemical usage. What must be noted is that this solution has been <a href=\"http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/origin/index.html\" title=\"\">around for 30 years</a>. SRI is credited to Henri de Laulanie, who came across the methodology while working with farmers in Madagascar in 1983. He set up an NGO to promote SRI. It was taken up by Norman Uphoff at the Cornell Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/science/17rice.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\" title=\"\">advocated for post 1998</a>, and soon other countries started adopting the method.  SRI is now estimated to be used by 4-5 million farmers worldwide.</p><p>These examples are a small sample of grassroots solutions. Consider the idea of using a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0C-lSvbLT4\" title=\"\">plastic water bottle as a light bulb</a> in slums without power as another inspirational example of bottom up innovation. The question then, is how to ensure that these solutions are discovered and disseminated, rather than remaining localised in the areas they are conceived. Fortunately, there are both private and charitable organisations actively improving the chances of ideas spreading.</p><p><strong>Approach 1: the charity model </strong></p><p>Working with media partners in poverty stricken countries, <a href=\"http://www.sawaworld.org/\" title=\"\">Sawa World</a> trains unemployed or vulnerable youth to be reporters in their communities. This training provides the youth with a living wage, and reporters are tasked with reporting on solutions to poverty found within their own communities. These solutions are then shared through media channels such as radio or TV. In 2012, Sawa youths produced 94 videos on local solutions to extreme poverty. The organisation also provides 'Sawa leaders' (solution innovators), with support to communicate their solutions further afield, leading to far better exposure of effective innovations. In the past five years, Sawa World has supported 30 Sawa leaders in 11 of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>The clear focus of the model is appreciated.

The solutions below are some exceptional examples of grassroots level innovations. The question is – how many other potential world changing solutions have remained in obscurity at source, never replicating sufficiently to make a significant change?</p><p><strong>Combating climate change, water and food security in arid regions</strong></p><p>A single farmer in Burkina Faso started an <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa\" title=\"\">agricultural revolution in the semi-desert area where he lives</a>, which has spread to other parts of Burkina Faso and into neighbouring countries. The 'tree farming' approach he championed (by personally travelling to around 100 other villages by motorbike) has re-greened millions of acres in the dry Sahel region; enough so that the effects can be seen from outer space. The innovation: pits which were dug to concentrate rainfall onto crop roots were made larger, and manure was added to them during the dry season. Tree seeds in the manure sprouted with the crops and these tree saplings increased soil fertility, shielded crops from overwhelming heat, and acted as windbreaks. At the macro level, areas with trees are more efficient for water harvesting than areas without. Water tables in the areas with tree farming have risen since the method gained popularity, despite a growing population.</p><p><strong>System of rice intensification: increasing crop yields while reducing water demand and chemical usage. </strong></p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution\" title=\"\">recent article</a>, another agricultural approach was explored in depth: the system of rice intensification (SRI). Through applying zero cost techniques to rice farming, small scale rice farmers have increased their crop yields by anywhere from 30-50% while reducing water and chemical usage. What must be noted is that this solution has been <a href=\"http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/origin/index.html\" title=\"\">around for 30 years</a>. SRI is credited to Henri de Laulanie, who came across the methodology while working with farmers in Madagascar in 1983. He set up an NGO to promote SRI. It was taken up by Norman Uphoff at the Cornell Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/science/17rice.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&\" title=\"\">advocated for post 1998</a>, and soon other countries started adopting the method.  SRI is now estimated to be used by 4-5 million farmers worldwide.</p><p>These examples are a small sample of grassroots solutions. Consider the idea of using a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0C-lSvbLT4\" title=\"\">plastic water bottle as a light bulb</a> in slums without power as another inspirational example of bottom up innovation. The question then, is how to ensure that these solutions are discovered and disseminated, rather than remaining localised in the areas they are conceived. Fortunately, there are both private and charitable organisations actively improving the chances of ideas spreading.</p><p><strong>Approach 1: the charity model </strong></p><p>Working with media partners in poverty stricken countries, <a href=\"http://www.sawaworld.org/\" title=\"\">Sawa World</a> trains unemployed or vulnerable youth to be reporters in their communities. This training provides the youth with a living wage, and reporters are tasked with reporting on solutions to poverty found within their own communities. These solutions are then shared through media channels such as radio or TV. In 2012, Sawa youths produced 94 videos on local solutions to extreme poverty. The organisation also provides 'Sawa leaders' (solution innovators), with support to communicate their solutions further afield, leading to far better exposure of effective innovations. In the past five years, Sawa World has supported 30 Sawa leaders in 11 of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>The clear focus of the model is appreciated. Their objectives and methods to effect change are unambiguous; but with a model that still relies on funding and charitable donations, the question remains as to whether Sawa World is, itself, scalable.</p><p><strong>Approach 2: the commercial model </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/\" title=\"\">GSMA</a> is an operator led trade association which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide.

This is more than an academic exercise. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/tributes-somali-lawyers-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">On Sunday, at least 35 people – including two human rights lawyers – were killed</a> in the deadliest Islamist militant attack in years in Mogadishu, the capital. Such a fragility assessment is supposed to be inclusive of the Somali population, but the existence of al-Shabaab, the insurgency group, will pose tests for inclusiveness, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/apr/19/somalia-army-uphill-battle-credibility\" title=\"\">though there are some early signs that the national army is beginning to deliver security</a>.</p><p></p><p>Somalia is the ninth developing country to adopt the new deal since it was endorsed at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/25/busan-explainer-aid-effectiveness\" title=\"\">an aid effectiveness conference in Busan</a>, South Korea, in 2011. The new deal, put forward by the g7+ group of 19 conflict-affected countries, is supposed to put developing countries in the driving seat on development strategy. At its core are five peace-building and state-building goals: legitimate and inclusive politics; security; justice; economic foundations (jobs); and revenues and services (managing revenue and delivering accountable and fair services). The thinking behind the new deal is that unless aid focuses on peace, money will go to waste.</p><p></p><p>Ahead of the meeting in Washington, Sierra Leone's development minister, Kaifala Marah, said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/18/time-confront-africa-trait-conflict\" title=\"\">progress on the new deal has been sluggish</a>. A common complaint – in addition to declining aid flows – from developing countries is that donors remain reluctant to shed the old approaches, including using their own consultants and foreign advisers, instead of using recipient country systems. The use of parallel systems – which duplicate existing resources, are expensive and do not build expertise in developing countries – boils down to a lack of trust, especially as donors are under domestic pressure to show value for money in aid budgets.</p><p></p><p>Adopting systems in recipient countries does not necessarily mean handing over money for general budget support. Other measures include discussing budgets in parliament rather than deciding them in the donor country, using countries' own measurement and evaluation systems instead of sending in consultants to serve only donors' needs, and donors making information on aid figures readily available.</p><p></p><p>\"The question is how the systems are used, how the risk is managed, how quickly problems can be identified and addressed, and seeing the development of systems to deliver, track, hold to account, monitor and evaluate public monies and public policies as a development aim in itself,\" an aid expert said. \"Mismanagement and corruption also happens outside of country systems – and in addition, the systems are not strengthened either – as was so evident in Afghanistan with the use of consultancy firms that were accountable, in the end, to no one.\"</p><p></p><p>Somalia will present a particularly challenging case for the new deal, given its reputation as the world's most fragile state, but donors are positive about the new government in Mogadishu.</p><p></p><p>\"We strongly support the new deal and are working to support governments implementing it in countries like Somalia, which is shaping up to be a good example of new deal implementation,\" a spokeswoman for the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) said. \"The UK government is committing 30% of our bilateral spend to fragile and conflict-affected states.\"</p><p></p><p>This year, DfID is providing £80m in aid to Somalia as part of a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CD0QFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F67414%2Fsomalia-2011.pdf&ei=5ypwUZ2nIYmvPP7-gbAB&usg=AFQjCNGYlDixLs-dAK8kok9EdEy2Ud6OPg&sig2=E5C-Ta1HcmSoiOSPKeT9Ow&bvm=bv.45373924,d.ZWU\" title=\"\">£267m package in 2011 to 2015</a> (pdf). Somalia is a key focus of the G8 group of industrialised countries under the UK's presidency this year.

This is more than an academic exercise. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/tributes-somali-lawyers-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">On Sunday, at least 35 people – including two human rights lawyers – were killed</a> in the deadliest Islamist militant attack in years in Mogadishu, the capital. Such a fragility assessment is supposed to be inclusive of the Somali population, but the existence of al-Shabaab, the insurgency group, will pose tests for inclusiveness, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/apr/19/somalia-army-uphill-battle-credibility\" title=\"\">though there are some early signs that the national army is beginning to deliver security</a>.</p><p></p><p>Somalia is the ninth developing country to adopt the new deal since it was endorsed at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/25/busan-explainer-aid-effectiveness\" title=\"\">an aid effectiveness conference in Busan</a>, South Korea, in 2011. The new deal, put forward by the g7+ group of 19 conflict-affected countries, is supposed to put developing countries in the driving seat on development strategy. At its core are five peace-building and state-building goals: legitimate and inclusive politics; security; justice; economic foundations (jobs); and revenues and services (managing revenue and delivering accountable and fair services). The thinking behind the new deal is that unless aid focuses on peace, money will go to waste.</p><p></p><p>Ahead of the meeting in Washington, Sierra Leone's development minister, Kaifala Marah, said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/18/time-confront-africa-trait-conflict\" title=\"\">progress on the new deal has been sluggish</a>. A common complaint – in addition to declining aid flows – from developing countries is that donors remain reluctant to shed the old approaches, including using their own consultants and foreign advisers, instead of using recipient country systems. The use of parallel systems – which duplicate existing resources, are expensive and do not build expertise in developing countries – boils down to a lack of trust, especially as donors are under domestic pressure to show value for money in aid budgets.</p><p></p><p>Adopting systems in recipient countries does not necessarily mean handing over money for general budget support. Other measures include discussing budgets in parliament rather than deciding them in the donor country, using countries' own measurement and evaluation systems instead of sending in consultants to serve only donors' needs, and donors making information on aid figures readily available.</p><p></p><p>\"The question is how the systems are used, how the risk is managed, how quickly problems can be identified and addressed, and seeing the development of systems to deliver, track, hold to account, monitor and evaluate public monies and public policies as a development aim in itself,\" an aid expert said. \"Mismanagement and corruption also happens outside of country systems – and in addition, the systems are not strengthened either – as was so evident in Afghanistan with the use of consultancy firms that were accountable, in the end, to no one.\"</p><p></p><p>Somalia will present a particularly challenging case for the new deal, given its reputation as the world's most fragile state, but donors are positive about the new government in Mogadishu.</p><p></p><p>\"We strongly support the new deal and are working to support governments implementing it in countries like Somalia, which is shaping up to be a good example of new deal implementation,\" a spokeswoman for the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) said. \"The UK government is committing 30% of our bilateral spend to fragile and conflict-affected states.\"</p><p></p><p>This year, DfID is providing £80m in aid to Somalia as part of a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CD0QFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F67414%2Fsomalia-2011.pdf&ei=5ypwUZ2nIYmvPP7-gbAB&usg=AFQjCNGYlDixLs-dAK8kok9EdEy2Ud6OPg&sig2=E5C-Ta1HcmSoiOSPKeT9Ow&bvm=bv.45373924,d.ZWU\" title=\"\">£267m package in 2011 to 2015</a> (pdf).

They need support to develop clear and effective ways of implementing command and control so that ordinary people can rely on the security forces to protect them,\" Pomfrey says.</p><p></p><p>But soldiers can't soldier without guns, and the SNA doesn't have enough. Officers are being trained by Ugandan troops (now deployed under the African Union mission <a href=\"http://amisom-au.org/\" title=\"\">Amisom</a>) on sand dunes. Simulating an assault, they pound up a ridge and drop to the ground at the top. Silence. Then they take aim. But many aren't even carrying guns; some pretend to shoot with sticks, others mime with two outstretched fingers.</p><p></p><p>On the sand slope down to the Indian Ocean, a few hundred of the thousand new SNA recruits are being trained to march by Somali officers, without Amisom support. \"They're training them in drama not military skills. If you engage them with the enemy, they will lose because they'll shoot each other,\" Ugandan intelligence officer Michael Baguma says. \"It's inhuman. This is sacrifice of these young boys.\"</p><p></p><p>Muhamud commands attention despite his slight build, is fluent in English, Somali and Kiswahili, and communicates easily with his Ugandan mentor, Major James Bua. \"They offer that sense of hope for the army,\" says Bua of his charges.</p><p></p><p>Mohamed Nur, a Nigerian police corporal who is training Somali policemen, says he was astonished to find Mogadishu safer than parts of Nigeria, and while patrolling Mogadishu at night has witnessed a revival of life after dark.</p><p></p><p>At 10pm, Nur's Amisom armoured vehicle pulls up at a crossroads in Furayaasha, once the key-forging district of Mogadishu.

Suicide bombers targeted the supreme court, while a car bomb detonated near the airport was aimed at aid workers.</p><p></p><p>\"It [the attack] demonstrates that at least some Somali institutions are woefully insecure, and that amid recent optimism in the city a sense of complacency has grown that urgently needs to be addressed,\" says <a href=\"http://rvi.asilialtd.com/content/james-hi-smith#.UW5txRzEfeE\" title=\"\">James Smith</a>, analyst at the <a href=\"http://rvi.asilialtd.com/\" title=\"\">Rift Valley Institute</a>.</p><p></p><p>The UN Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that despite recent gains, \"<a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OCHA_Somalia_Humanitarian_Bulletin_March_2013.pdf\" title=\"\">the continuing instability in parts of Somalia and access restrictions for humanitarian workers remain major obstacles for aid delivery</a>\" (pdf).</p><p></p><p>Many NGOs compromise their neutrality and accept military support to get things done. Some negotiate with al-Shabaab, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/28/al-shabaab-bans-aid-agencies-somalia\" title=\"\">banned aid agencies in 2011</a>. Despite being on the back foot, al-Shabaab has retaken two towns since March.</p><p></p><p>Selling arms to Somalia had been embargoed by the UN since 1992, shortly before the failed US attempt to \"restore order\" among warlords vying for power. A temporary and partial lifting of the embargo in March means the country is now allowed to buy small arms. This is a significant show of trust by the security council in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/somalia-confidence-grows-mogadishu-editorial\" title=\"\">the new federal government</a>, which has only been in place since August; an important step in preparing the country to safeguard itself.</p><p></p><p>Ed Pomfret, Somalia campaign manager for <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/somalia\" title=\"\">Oxfam</a>, argues that developing the means for the security forces to respect human rights will do more for security than additional weaponry. Rape is rife, and according to Human Rights Watch, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/somali-president-admits-problems-of-rapes-by-army-troops-vows-to-stop-the-crime/2013/04/09/5cbb89b6-a131-11e2-bd52-614156372695_story.html\" title=\"\">many are carried out by men in uniform</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"Building the capacity of the security forces is about more than just guns. They need support to develop clear and effective ways of implementing command and control so that ordinary people can rely on the security forces to protect them,\" Pomfrey says.</p><p></p><p>But soldiers can't soldier without guns, and the SNA doesn't have enough. Officers are being trained by Ugandan troops (now deployed under the African Union mission <a href=\"http://amisom-au.org/\" title=\"\">Amisom</a>) on sand dunes. Simulating an assault, they pound up a ridge and drop to the ground at the top. Silence. Then they take aim. But many aren't even carrying guns; some pretend to shoot with sticks, others mime with two outstretched fingers.</p><p></p><p>On the sand slope down to the Indian Ocean, a few hundred of the thousand new SNA recruits are being trained to march by Somali officers, without Amisom support. \"They're training them in drama not military skills. If you engage them with the enemy, they will lose because they'll shoot each other,\" Ugandan intelligence officer Michael Baguma says. \"It's inhuman. This is sacrifice of these young boys.\"</p><p></p><p>Muhamud commands attention despite his slight build, is fluent in English, Somali and Kiswahili, and communicates easily with his Ugandan mentor, Major James Bua. \"They offer that sense of hope for the army,\" says Bua of his charges.</p><p></p><p>Mohamed Nur, a Nigerian police corporal who is training Somali policemen, says he was astonished to find Mogadishu safer than parts of Nigeria, and while patrolling Mogadishu at night has witnessed a revival of life after dark.</p><p></p><p>At 10pm, Nur's Amisom armoured vehicle pulls up at a crossroads in Furayaasha, once the key-forging district of Mogadishu. A couple of young boys stand in a doorway, waiting to pay 2,000 Somali shillings (80p) to take a turn on a PlayStation. The console's owner, 24-year old Abdiweli, is making $12 (£7) a day, having bought it with a TV screen for $300. \"We could never do this with al-Shabaab. They would have destroyed it,\" Abdiweli says.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/conflict-and-development\">Conflict and development</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/somalia\">Somalia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa\">Africa</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessica-hatcher\">Jessica Hatcher</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I'm Annie Kelly and in this episode we'll be looking at the hugely complex issue of modern-day slavery. We'll be asking why more than 150 years after global slavery was abolished, an estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour. What does slavery look like in today's globalised labour market? And who is profiting from the global trade in people? We'll discuss these issues in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>According to the United Nations, people-trafficking is the world's third largest criminal industry. And the international labour organisation estimates the profits from global forced labour to be at least $44bn a year. But as we'll hear later, reliable data on this issue is thin on the ground, making it difficult to really assess the scale and scope of the modern-day slave trade.</p><p></p><p>With me today I have three guests who've been tackling these issues head on. But before we get into the discussion let's hear from Leonardo Sakamoto, a journalist and activist, who's been tracking forced and bonded labour in the Brazilian Amazon and pioneering what he considers a new approach to ending the criminal exploitation he's witnessed there.</p><p></p><p>I spoke to him earlier today and started by asking him how the slave trade operates in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> Slave labour is illegal in Brazil since May 13 1888, of course, but this kind of exploitation is still used in the way of cutting costs in the very competitive environment. You have slave labour. You have illegal work connected in legal networks of trades, of networks of production in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you've witnessed first-hand in Brazil, so the conditions of some of the workers engaged in this kind of forced labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> The conditions depends where the place where the workers were found in the slave labour situation. When you see workers in areas in the Amazon, the conditions are the worst possible. The workers don't receive enough food for their needs. The workers, they must make camps inside the jungle. The workers don't have access to salaries. The workers are sometimes are threatened to death. And sometimes the workers have to pay for their own tools to work. Sometimes you see very big cattle ranches – there is a care of the workers that is smaller than the care of the cattle.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Why or how is this being allowed to continue in Brazil?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> They used to say here in Brazil that slavery is sustained by a tripod: poverty, impunity and greed. And of course poverty is a very bad condition, the lack of opportunities. We're not talking about just money, we're talking about the conditions to have a good life. And this is the first. And they push the workers to try jobs in very far places with no share that we receive, for example.</p><p></p><p>Second, we have the impunity even [though] the Brazilian government, Brazilian state, has been getting good goals, good advances [in] the last 18 years of fighting against slavery in the country. We're still facing problems to get rich people that are using slave labour in jail, for example.</p><p></p><p>And the third, of course, people use slave labour in Brazil not because they are evil, we're not talking about … it's not a moral issue it's about an economic issue. The people use slave labour in the way to cutting down costs in their production.</p><p></p><p>I like to say that slavery is not a disease, slavery is a symptom. If you take malaria, for example, if you use just a medicine, just a pill to headache you will die. In the same way if you stay and rescue workers, for example, it's good everybody will see it's OK, it's good to rescue workers but we need to go beyond not just rescue workers but to change our model of development; that is the disease. Our model of development excludes concentrate wealth and create problems, for example, to the worker that has their own lands to plant and to produce. And this model is seen in the last ways responsible for the slavery in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Leonardo Sakamoto talking to me earlier from Brazil. So on the panel today: on the line from Beirut we have Beate Andrees, head of the special action programme to combat forced labour at the International Labour Organisation; and with me in the studio Romana Cacchioli from Anti-Slavery International; and Andrew Wallis, the chief executive of Unseen, a UK-based anti-trafficking organisation. Thank you all for taking part.</p><p></p><p>So let's get into it. What exactly do we mean when we talk about modern-day slavery? Romana, can you help us define this?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Well for people at the coal face, if you like, in slavery it's about being treated as property. It's about being controlled. It's about a denial of all their rights and I mean all of those rights. It's about being forced to work, coerced to work under threat. It's about having your freedom of movement curtailed and, in some cases, people fall into slavery or are forced into slavery because of debt. Other times it's because of the low status of individuals get caught up in debts or in situations where they can't remove themselves. So, essentially, for people in slavery, it's about control and it's about being treated as property and as a workforce, an engine to be exploited for, usually, commercial gain, for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate, slavery is obviously defined in various international conventions and under various international codes of law. Can you just explain a little bit about that and how slavery is defined on an international legal platform?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes indeed. There are a variety of international instruments to define slavery and related practice such as forced labour, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. The first instrument was adopted in 1926 by the League of Nations, the slavery convention. And then we had subsequent instruments; one, for instance, adopted by the ILO in 1930 defining forced labour. And then the most recent one, the trafficking in persons protocol adopted by the UN in 2000.</p><p></p><p>I think what's the common element of all these definitions is pretty much what Romana just said; it's the element of coercion, it's the element of overbearing a person's power and it's often through deceit, false promises, a way of treating people as commodities and not as workers, restraining their free choices and decision-making power over the conditions of their work. So, essentially, the key element is really coercion. These forms of coercion can be very subtle in modern times. People are not held in chains; in most of the cases they are really, in principle, free to, by law at least, to leave, but they are constrained. And that's precisely what [constitutes] slavery today.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And that's a very complex issue isn't it, because you ask where do you draw that line between cheap labour or exploited labour and then forced or slave labour. I mean …</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Absolutely.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, do you think that part of the problem is that slavery in today's globalised labour market is really hard to define and it's really hard for consumers to recognise as well?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Yes it is. It's also really important in terms of how we express what slavery is, how we understand it because that then leads to how we're going to tackle it. So, for me, I think the understanding around it is a form of illicit trade where a human being has been commodified in order to earn their slaver vast profits, in some cases with very little risk of being caught. And so the motivation for someone commodifying and enslaving someone is a financial motivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that then works out in terms of the globalised labour trade because there are two issues at play: one is the demand that we have for cheap goods. And as soon as you put that demand into the equation it works its way down a supply chain and creates vulnerabilities where you're going to have to have slaves involved. And on the other side you have an illicit trade with very smart business people that are looking to make profit and their commodity is trading in human beings.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, Andrew's raised some really interesting points there. I wanted to ask you why is it that the ILO uses the term \"forced labour\" instead of the word \"slavery\"? Can you tell me about some of the subtleties around that?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well first of all it's because we … by mandate from the Forced Labour Convention that was adopted in 1930 in which it was very much meant as a complementary tool to the slavery convention, it was meant to address, in particular, state-imposed forced labour, and at the time, forced labour imposed by the colonial states in particular. One problem I have with the notion of trade and the definition which you have in the slavery convention, the condition of ownership, it kinds of misleads us in understanding the more subtle and modern forms of slavery. And I think what you have in the definition of forced labour, the ILO definition, is basically the focus on coercion, it's the manners of penalty, it's to understand how people are constrained in their choices.</p><p></p><p>So sometimes these people end up in a situation of forced labour without any deception, without any intermediary; they're not being traded in a sense as they were traded 200 years ago. They just end up in a situation of forced labour because they're in a very vulnerable situation and they have no bargaining power. So I think in this sense the definition of forced labour is very helpful because it helps us focus on the exploitation and less so on the transaction that may or may not precede a situation of exploitation.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> I guess one of the problems is when you've got a word like coercion it's really, really hard to define exactly what is coercion and what is willingness on the part of the person who is being exploited. I mean, Romana, in terms of your work at Anti-Slavery International, how do you see those issues playing out?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I would totally agree with what Beate's saying, actually. I think that sometimes it is a bit of a distraction really to focus too much on the issue, to sort of look at it in terms of a trade and a movement of people, because actually what we're really all working towards is to stop the exploitation, the gross exploitation of people. So I also agree with Beate that the Forced Labour Convention is the most helpful because that's what covers most of the forms, the contemporary forms of slavery today in the world, whether we're looking at bonded labour in South Asia or even child labour, the worst forms of child labour; trafficking is the movement of people. But at the end of that there has to be an exploitation and, for the most part, that is in labour exploitation; the big numbers of people who are trafficked are in fact trafficked for labour. And the coercion is central.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And we heard Leonardo earlier saying that this wasn't a moral issue it was an economic issue, Andrew, would you agree with that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think it can be both because I think in some of the equation, the morality is around the demand that then creates the environment for that slavery to exist. But maybe the dividing line between what is exploitative behaviour and what then tips us over that line into slavery is around the issue of is that person free to leave. So if they're not, and that could be a whole number of reasons why they can't leave, they could just be in an exploitative situation but they could walk away from that situation. Is that slavery? For my definition, no, it isn't, because the moment that someone is not free to leave, they're coerced and they're controlled, they've become a commodity. And actually that state goes all the way back to slavery thousands of years ago, which is where a human being is a commodity. So in the Roman Empire, the view of a slave was, well, it's just like a hammer: I can use it as a tool and then if it breaks I just toss it away. That still exists today in terms of that's what slavery is. So, yes, that's a moral issue around should a fellow human being be viewed as just a commodity to be used?</p><p></p><p>But then the economic issues are also in play as well, in terms of complex supply chains, the desire to have cheap goods and all of that then plays in and creates an environment in which the illicit trade in human beings can take place.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> It's probably quite a good moment now to read a comment from guardian.co.uk. One of our readers, <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/degutsdeybust/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">degutsdeybust</a> has just come back from working in India and he can't believe that the statistic of 21 million people trapped in forced labour can be accurate. But he says maybe it depends on the definitions. And he says: \"In India there are around 300 million people who are routinely excluded from normal life because of their caste and many who have no option but to work cleaning out latrines or sewers. How do we address this kind of slavery when people aren't necessarily forced into this work but when there are no other options? What's the difference between this and slavery?\" Romana, have you got anything to …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Yes, I do understand where he's coming from because it is really hard. And I'm sure Beate will also agree that it's very difficult to draw the line, so you have a continuum and I think that's how, as Andrew was saying, a continuum of practices of experiences from the worst end where people are really enslaved, they can't move, they're forced to work, all their rights are completely taken away from them; right down to exploitative labour; you know you're working overtime perhaps and not being paid for it. So a whole continuum range of experiences. In India, it is true and the majority of people who are in bonded labour are from the Dalit or tribal castes.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Can you just very briefly explain exactly what you mean by bonded labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> So, bonded labour is that people are coerced into forced labour, forced to work to pay off a debt. So they've incurred a debt often for either subsistence or to pay medical costs or marriage costs or even migration costs; in India that's what we're finding more and more is that people are migrating to work, they have to take a loan and then they end up working and not being paid and not being aware how much they owe. And that debt, then with interest, accrues and they may not be able to leave that job. They may be coerced, forced to work under threat of violence. And so there are many, many hundreds of thousands of people who are really in that very dire situation. But discrimination is pervasive in India and not everybody who is a Dalit or from a tribal group will be in a situation of bonded or forced labour.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, Beate, you heard there that our commenter doesn't believe that the ILO's figure of 21 million people can be accurate. Do you believe that it truly reflects the scale of the problem on a global level?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well, absolutely, otherwise we wouldn't have published it. But I should probably include one caveat and we said it very clearly in our report: that this is based on the best possible methodology and data available today. We think it is a conservative number, it could well be higher, it's unlikely that it is lower. But as long as we don't have reliable national estimates, we can't have a more reliable figure.</p><p></p><p>Now, of course, it depends a little bit, the scale of the problem, and the measurement depends on how you define it, that's very clear. We have based our estimate on the ILO's definition of forced labour, which means that the cases we have verified and counted as a forced labour case have to have an element or coercion. So the simple fact that you are in a vulnerable situation in itself is not forced labour. There has to be an intent on the part of the employer, the abuser, to exploit the person for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, really briefly, what conclusions do you believe we can draw from the fact that the ILO is saying that this is a conservative estimate because it's only based on the available national data that it's been able to acquire?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think there's three issues at play. One is the issue around definition; what are we talking about and where's the dividing line between what's slavery and what isn't? Whenever you have definitions that you've got to get governments to agree to you always have a race to the bottom; what's the lowest common denominator that everybody can agree on. So that then immediately skews your figures, I would argue.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, I think there's a systemic fear at government level and a society level to actually be honest and say, regardless of abolishing slavery 200 plus years ago, we still have slavery. So I think we have to have that honest debate at government level, at society level, that says this is still a problem that exists. Therefore you then get the impetus to actually shine a light on it. And that then leads to the data issue, which you know the ILO have identified it, we identified it in terms of the report that's just come out, which is to try and get hard and fast data is next to impossible for all the reasons that have just been listed. But also I think it's just this, do we want to lift this rock knowing underneath there's this gunk that we've got to look at. And my observation is we don't.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Well, thank you all.

Romana?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> A weak legal framework; so weak laws, weak enforcement; where we have laws they're not enforced. Discrimination, because often the people who are in situations of slavery come from groups that are marginalised in society and so they're very vulnerable. Other factors which, sort of push factors, if you like, can be conflict, migration and food scarcity issues which force families and their children out to work; it's a whole myriad really of push factors and reasons why slavery continues today and is with us today. Is that the question you asked me, I can't remember?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, have you got anything to add to that from your work collecting this data in your office at the ILO?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> I think Romana has summarised it very nicely. The key structural causes are very much linked to big institutions in a broad sense, not just laws but also ministries, governance in a broader sense. And the other one we see very clearly coming out of all of our research is indeed discrimination.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, your organisation, Unseen, was recently involved in a study looking at the scale of modern slavery here in the UK. What were the main points that you took from that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> So the Centre for Social Justice commissioned in effect what was a two-year, evidence-led review of what was the state of modern slavery in the United Kingdom. So, yes, it was UK-focused but obviously we were all aware of the global context. I think right off the top what we discovered was a lack of leadership on this issue. And probably problematic within that as well was wanting to see the issue framed just within an immigration debate. And yet if you look at the legal structure, the UK, and increasingly around the globe, what you have is legislation that views it as a criminal act. So you have a perpetrator of a crime and you have a victim of crime. And in the globalised world we need to move it away from just being a debate about immigration and I think we need to move it back to being a debate about: here is a crime that's taken place.</p><p></p><p>We also found that data was a big issue, which, in trying to ask the question what is the size of the problem, we took the decision very early on that we would not be able to answer that question. So here's a first-world country, and the UK government would admit this as well, that we have no handle on the data. The only data we have are those that have chosen to access the government's care programme. But we know, as an organisation, that isn't the true figure; and whether you talk to law enforcement, statutory agencies, everybody will tell you that is not a true figure.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And obviously behind that data are the people who are affected by this globalised labour situation. Let's hear from someone now with direct experience of being trafficked into the UK. Last week, reporter Harriet Grant interviewed a young woman originally from China, who says she was a victim of forced labour by a criminal gang. Her name's been changed to protect her identity.</p><p></p><p><strong>HG</strong> In a cramped bedsit in a northern English town Min talks about the man who brought her here from China. She tells me that her family were being harassed by the police because they were followers of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong. So her grandmother put her into the hands of a man who said he could help her get to Britain, where he said the government would offer her protection and the chance of a new life.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side. He brought me to a house where I stayed for a long time. I was just locked inside the house. They told me that I could not escape and if I tried they would kill my grandmother in China, that it was dangerous for me to escape.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>After taking a boat, then a train, still confused about where she was, their final destination was a cannabis factory in England where she was again held prisoner.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"I had to tend to the plants, water, pick them and fertilise them. They said that if I didn't my grandmother would have to pay money and that if I escaped they would kill her. I was really scared.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>In 2008, the police discovered the factory and closed it down. Despite telling them what had happened to her, Min was charged with cannabis cultivation and sentenced to 12 months in prison. It was only after she finished the sentence that the UK Border Agency acknowledged she was reasonably likely to be a victim of trafficking. Last year they wrote to Min saying that because she escaped from that situation, she cannot now be described as a victim of trafficking, even though they do accept she was under the control of her trafficker when arrested. The letter tells her that as a foreign criminal, she's now subject to deportation for the public good.</p><p></p><p>Min has a life in England now. She's pregnant and frightened about being sent home where her trafficker might find her. There's a test case at the Court of Appeal in May that is going to look at four cases similar to Min's. When I spoke to Min's lawyer, Hani Zubeidi at Fadiga & Co, he told me that he hopes these cases will set a precedent which will allow Min to challenge her own conviction. Until then she waits, unable to sleep at night, fearful of being sent home, branded a foreign criminal.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> That was Harriet Grant reporting and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/apr/07/human-traffic-victims-drug-factories\" title=\"\">you can read the full Observer article at guardian.co.uk</a>. So, Andrew, what does Min's case tell us about the failure of international efforts to tackle trafficking?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Unfortunately her case is atypical. Just going through her story, you've got issues of a misunderstanding around immigration; you have criminalisation of a victim; you have identification of that victim but then being told but you're still an immigrant therefore we're going to turf you out of the country. So not only do we not recognise the victim, but we then penalise that victim. And then that plays into other issues around what is the awareness within statutory agencies and front-line agencies of what is being presented in front of them. Is it a cannabis factory with a drug cultivator; or is it actually a victim of crime who is there against their will, who, under the threat of violence, coercion, fear of retribution to their family is held there and will work there? And then behind that you have, well, why are they in this country producing cannabis in the first place? Because society wants a demand for it. The UK is now net exporter of cannabis. So there's your pull factor into the UK. And where's our reintegration of survivors? That individual remains vulnerable. If returned to the situation where they've come from, in all likelihood will be retrafficked. And so there are so many issues at play that just basically shows you, to quote The Thick of It, an omnishambles of a response.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, do you have a response to that? Obviously, that goes back to a lot of what you were saying when you were defining forced labour for us at the beginning of the programme.</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes, absolutely. You have all the elements here: the deception, restriction of the freedom of movements, where that's a clear case of trafficking. And what it really shows is the failure of identification systems. It should have been, from the beginning, this person should have received assistance, there should have been no doubts about her circumstances. And yet it just didn't happen. And it's very symptomatic, particularly for workers and sectors that are informal, so, obviously, cannabis production is an illegal activity in most countries, but also the sex industry is a very typical, not being protected as victims of forced labour. The same is true for other activities like forced begging or more formal activities, domestic work and even construction and so on.</p><p></p><p>So I think it's a clear problem here to properly identify potential victims and then provide them with the necessary care.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> OK. And we had a question from a listener that kind of ties into this. <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/valentinacaron/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">ValentinaCaron</a>, who worked for an NGO in Cambodia, this is what she wrote to us. She said: \"It's a shame that western donors rarely include activities like police training, I'm not saying that giving money for children's education is less important, but I feel that police training could really change the legal environment in which the Cambodian people live. Without an effective implementation of the international standards that bind Cambodia, it would never be possible to have this justice.\" She's offering some kind of solution. Romana, obviously Anti-Slavery International, a global organisation, have you seen these kind of issues that play around …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Absolutely. I think we would all agree that we need better training and awareness-raising amongst law enforcement. But immigration officers, particularly on many of the borders in the global south, but also immigration officers in Europe, but all criminal justice actors. So for the UK it would be about the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, clearly being able to access, not just the police being able to identify a potential victim of trafficking but it's also the criminal justice actors all the way through, right through to judges. And also being able to communicate that to juries in trafficking trials so that clearly victims' stories are well represented because they're very complex stories often.</p><p></p><p>If we look at a couple of cases that have been held here in the UK on domestic servitude, trafficking for domestic servitude, where you've got issues around witchcraft and how children have been, or adults have been controlled through issues around witchcraft, this really needs to be unpacked, so there has to be a real understanding by all actors that are working to what are the patterns of trafficking, what are the coercive methods that are used? And what are the areas of exploitation, because as we've heard, cannabis … who would have thought that people are being trafficked into cannabis a few years ago? So this is an emerging area where now we're finding people are being trafficked into criminal activities like forced begging, many Roma and Bulgarians on the streets of London and elsewhere that are being forced to beg. And this is a new area.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Do you think that part of the problem is, is that it has evolved, it has changed? So if you ask maybe the average person on the street here in the UK: what is slavery today? they may think of children in brick kilns in Pakistan; they may not think that it happens here in the UK or in other developed nations. And I just wonder whether there was that problem with the language that's being used, people not understanding the different types of modern day slavery that are going on; what's the difference between someone who's been trafficked, what's the difference between that and migration patterns? It's a very complex language being used.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> It is complex. And it's also going back to that image of expecting people in slavery to be in chains, and it's not at all like that now. And it's not just people being locked into factories. It's also people, you know, could be working in a bar or in restaurants, in construction, so forced labour situations are really around us all the time. It's just that we're not seeing it in that sort of framework, really.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate was mentioning earlier that she felt that there had been progress made by some national governments in acknowledging this problem; I was wondering in terms of the anti-slavery movement, the NGOs, the civil society groups who are working on this issue, do you believe that you're really making an impact in global efforts to end slavery?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I think we are. Sometimes I think it's a drop in the ocean. But I think agree with Beate there has been a movement over the last few years to recognise the issue and the importance of the issue. Over the last 10 years the issue has become more and more at the top of the political agenda. Of course we're not there yet. I wouldn't want to pat anybody on the back, we need to do a lot more. In terms of civil society I think there are lots more … we've got business that are coming on board now as well, so I think it's about everybody being involved in this campaign, everybody being aware of what it is and being able to identify it and report it to the authorities when they see it.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Andrew, you actually come from a corporate background, don't you? I was wondering what your views on this might be? Do you think that things need to change if we're really going to make strides forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I'm going to be slightly controversial and I think what we've got better at is identifying it. Have we got better at eradicating it? I don't think we have. And I think it's an issue of systems process. So systems deliver processes and deliver results. And if you look across the globe and say, well, what are the results five years, 10 years, 100 years? The results are we have slaves. The results are: there are very few prosecutions. The results are: it's a high-return, low-risk industry to be involved in. And if you approach it as a commercial business, and back to what I was saying earlier about let's frame it as an illicit trade, and let's understand that the people that get involved in this and turn human beings into a commodity are doing it for business reasons, they're doing it to make money, they're doing it to get a return on their commodity. Then, are we winning? No, we're not. And I think there's a whole list of reasons why we're not. I think governments are glued to bureaucratic response and traffickers are, like, fair enough, carry on doing that, because we're fast, we're nimble, we're lean and mean and we can evolve.</p><p></p><p>So I actually think we need to be honest with ourselves, be it the NGO community, government community or the business community, and say are we actually tackling this and dismantling it? And I would say we're not. I think we can do it. I think the tools are there to enable us to do it, but is the will there, is the political will there, is the will there amongst NGOs to do it, is the will there within society to change practices that create the demand and the pulls for slavery to exist?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, our appetite for cheap products as well, I imagine?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> For sure.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I do hear what you're saying, Andrew, but I do also think that things have come a long way, honestly, in the last 10 years. We wouldn't have been having this conversation. It was really difficult to get any journalist or anybody to talk about slavery and forced labour. And just in the last 10 years, when you see the proliferation of NGOs just in the UK working on this issue. I mean for a very long time, Anti-Slavery International was one of the only organisations working, and the ILO of course, Beate of course, and so there's a lot more awareness. I mean, clearly, there's a lot more to do. Clearly, in terms of business needs to also take its responsibilities. We need a transparent supply chain which is audited and that audit needs to be transparent. And we need accountability. Governments, yes, we do need to make it more of a priority but I do think we are making steps, I don't want to be the doom and gloom merchant, there are solutions out there because I've seen communities change. Empowerment can happen quite quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, are you optimistic about the way forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> It's an area where change will only emerge very slowly, because it's linked to a change of attitudes and behaviours of different groups of people, be it government, business and the people concerned. I'd like to come back quickly on the economic interest, because Andrew is also right in saying that as long as we don't understand these economic drivers, we won't really move the agenda forward. And that's very true. I mean, that's one of the reasons why we have worked on the profit figures, we will produce a new figure this year, it's most likely to be much higher than the one you have quoted in the beginning. We need to understand the economic interest and we need to get business involved. And it's very much on the ILO's agenda.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Fabulous. So, in conclusion, we need to really understand the money and who's profiting and understand it as a criminal business as well. Well, I'm afraid that's all we've got time for today.

I'm Annie Kelly and in this episode we'll be looking at the hugely complex issue of modern-day slavery. We'll be asking why more than 150 years after global slavery was abolished, an estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour. What does slavery look like in today's globalised labour market? And who is profiting from the global trade in people? We'll discuss these issues in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>According to the United Nations, people-trafficking is the world's third largest criminal industry. And the international labour organisation estimates the profits from global forced labour to be at least $44bn a year. But as we'll hear later, reliable data on this issue is thin on the ground, making it difficult to really assess the scale and scope of the modern-day slave trade.</p><p></p><p>With me today I have three guests who've been tackling these issues head on. But before we get into the discussion let's hear from Leonardo Sakamoto, a journalist and activist, who's been tracking forced and bonded labour in the Brazilian Amazon and pioneering what he considers a new approach to ending the criminal exploitation he's witnessed there.</p><p></p><p>I spoke to him earlier today and started by asking him how the slave trade operates in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> Slave labour is illegal in Brazil since May 13 1888, of course, but this kind of exploitation is still used in the way of cutting costs in the very competitive environment. You have slave labour. You have illegal work connected in legal networks of trades, of networks of production in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you've witnessed first-hand in Brazil, so the conditions of some of the workers engaged in this kind of forced labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> The conditions depends where the place where the workers were found in the slave labour situation. When you see workers in areas in the Amazon, the conditions are the worst possible. The workers don't receive enough food for their needs. The workers, they must make camps inside the jungle. The workers don't have access to salaries. The workers are sometimes are threatened to death. And sometimes the workers have to pay for their own tools to work. Sometimes you see very big cattle ranches – there is a care of the workers that is smaller than the care of the cattle.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Why or how is this being allowed to continue in Brazil?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> They used to say here in Brazil that slavery is sustained by a tripod: poverty, impunity and greed. And of course poverty is a very bad condition, the lack of opportunities. We're not talking about just money, we're talking about the conditions to have a good life. And this is the first. And they push the workers to try jobs in very far places with no share that we receive, for example.</p><p></p><p>Second, we have the impunity even [though] the Brazilian government, Brazilian state, has been getting good goals, good advances [in] the last 18 years of fighting against slavery in the country. We're still facing problems to get rich people that are using slave labour in jail, for example.</p><p></p><p>And the third, of course, people use slave labour in Brazil not because they are evil, we're not talking about … it's not a moral issue it's about an economic issue. The people use slave labour in the way to cutting down costs in their production.</p><p></p><p>I like to say that slavery is not a disease, slavery is a symptom. If you take malaria, for example, if you use just a medicine, just a pill to headache you will die. In the same way if you stay and rescue workers, for example, it's good everybody will see it's OK, it's good to rescue workers but we need to go beyond not just rescue workers but to change our model of development; that is the disease. Our model of development excludes concentrate wealth and create problems, for example, to the worker that has their own lands to plant and to produce. And this model is seen in the last ways responsible for the slavery in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Leonardo Sakamoto talking to me earlier from Brazil. So on the panel today: on the line from Beirut we have Beate Andrees, head of the special action programme to combat forced labour at the International Labour Organisation; and with me in the studio Romana Cacchioli from Anti-Slavery International; and Andrew Wallis, the chief executive of Unseen, a UK-based anti-trafficking organisation. Thank you all for taking part.</p><p></p><p>So let's get into it. What exactly do we mean when we talk about modern-day slavery? Romana, can you help us define this?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Well for people at the coal face, if you like, in slavery it's about being treated as property. It's about being controlled. It's about a denial of all their rights and I mean all of those rights. It's about being forced to work, coerced to work under threat. It's about having your freedom of movement curtailed and, in some cases, people fall into slavery or are forced into slavery because of debt. Other times it's because of the low status of individuals get caught up in debts or in situations where they can't remove themselves. So, essentially, for people in slavery, it's about control and it's about being treated as property and as a workforce, an engine to be exploited for, usually, commercial gain, for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate, slavery is obviously defined in various international conventions and under various international codes of law. Can you just explain a little bit about that and how slavery is defined on an international legal platform?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes indeed. There are a variety of international instruments to define slavery and related practice such as forced labour, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. The first instrument was adopted in 1926 by the League of Nations, the slavery convention. And then we had subsequent instruments; one, for instance, adopted by the ILO in 1930 defining forced labour. And then the most recent one, the trafficking in persons protocol adopted by the UN in 2000.</p><p></p><p>I think what's the common element of all these definitions is pretty much what Romana just said; it's the element of coercion, it's the element of overbearing a person's power and it's often through deceit, false promises, a way of treating people as commodities and not as workers, restraining their free choices and decision-making power over the conditions of their work. So, essentially, the key element is really coercion. These forms of coercion can be very subtle in modern times. People are not held in chains; in most of the cases they are really, in principle, free to, by law at least, to leave, but they are constrained. And that's precisely what [constitutes] slavery today.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And that's a very complex issue isn't it, because you ask where do you draw that line between cheap labour or exploited labour and then forced or slave labour. I mean …</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Absolutely.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, do you think that part of the problem is that slavery in today's globalised labour market is really hard to define and it's really hard for consumers to recognise as well?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Yes it is. It's also really important in terms of how we express what slavery is, how we understand it because that then leads to how we're going to tackle it. So, for me, I think the understanding around it is a form of illicit trade where a human being has been commodified in order to earn their slaver vast profits, in some cases with very little risk of being caught. And so the motivation for someone commodifying and enslaving someone is a financial motivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that then works out in terms of the globalised labour trade because there are two issues at play: one is the demand that we have for cheap goods. And as soon as you put that demand into the equation it works its way down a supply chain and creates vulnerabilities where you're going to have to have slaves involved. And on the other side you have an illicit trade with very smart business people that are looking to make profit and their commodity is trading in human beings.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, Andrew's raised some really interesting points there. I wanted to ask you why is it that the ILO uses the term \"forced labour\" instead of the word \"slavery\"? Can you tell me about some of the subtleties around that?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well first of all it's because we … by mandate from the Forced Labour Convention that was adopted in 1930 in which it was very much meant as a complementary tool to the slavery convention, it was meant to address, in particular, state-imposed forced labour, and at the time, forced labour imposed by the colonial states in particular. One problem I have with the notion of trade and the definition which you have in the slavery convention, the condition of ownership, it kinds of misleads us in understanding the more subtle and modern forms of slavery. And I think what you have in the definition of forced labour, the ILO definition, is basically the focus on coercion, it's the manners of penalty, it's to understand how people are constrained in their choices.</p><p></p><p>So sometimes these people end up in a situation of forced labour without any deception, without any intermediary; they're not being traded in a sense as they were traded 200 years ago. They just end up in a situation of forced labour because they're in a very vulnerable situation and they have no bargaining power. So I think in this sense the definition of forced labour is very helpful because it helps us focus on the exploitation and less so on the transaction that may or may not precede a situation of exploitation.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> I guess one of the problems is when you've got a word like coercion it's really, really hard to define exactly what is coercion and what is willingness on the part of the person who is being exploited. I mean, Romana, in terms of your work at Anti-Slavery International, how do you see those issues playing out?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I would totally agree with what Beate's saying, actually. I think that sometimes it is a bit of a distraction really to focus too much on the issue, to sort of look at it in terms of a trade and a movement of people, because actually what we're really all working towards is to stop the exploitation, the gross exploitation of people. So I also agree with Beate that the Forced Labour Convention is the most helpful because that's what covers most of the forms, the contemporary forms of slavery today in the world, whether we're looking at bonded labour in South Asia or even child labour, the worst forms of child labour; trafficking is the movement of people. But at the end of that there has to be an exploitation and, for the most part, that is in labour exploitation; the big numbers of people who are trafficked are in fact trafficked for labour. And the coercion is central.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And we heard Leonardo earlier saying that this wasn't a moral issue it was an economic issue, Andrew, would you agree with that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think it can be both because I think in some of the equation, the morality is around the demand that then creates the environment for that slavery to exist. But maybe the dividing line between what is exploitative behaviour and what then tips us over that line into slavery is around the issue of is that person free to leave. So if they're not, and that could be a whole number of reasons why they can't leave, they could just be in an exploitative situation but they could walk away from that situation. Is that slavery? For my definition, no, it isn't, because the moment that someone is not free to leave, they're coerced and they're controlled, they've become a commodity. And actually that state goes all the way back to slavery thousands of years ago, which is where a human being is a commodity. So in the Roman Empire, the view of a slave was, well, it's just like a hammer: I can use it as a tool and then if it breaks I just toss it away. That still exists today in terms of that's what slavery is. So, yes, that's a moral issue around should a fellow human being be viewed as just a commodity to be used?</p><p></p><p>But then the economic issues are also in play as well, in terms of complex supply chains, the desire to have cheap goods and all of that then plays in and creates an environment in which the illicit trade in human beings can take place.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> It's probably quite a good moment now to read a comment from guardian.co.uk. One of our readers, <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/degutsdeybust/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">degutsdeybust</a> has just come back from working in India and he can't believe that the statistic of 21 million people trapped in forced labour can be accurate. But he says maybe it depends on the definitions. And he says: \"In India there are around 300 million people who are routinely excluded from normal life because of their caste and many who have no option but to work cleaning out latrines or sewers. How do we address this kind of slavery when people aren't necessarily forced into this work but when there are no other options? What's the difference between this and slavery?\" Romana, have you got anything to …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Yes, I do understand where he's coming from because it is really hard. And I'm sure Beate will also agree that it's very difficult to draw the line, so you have a continuum and I think that's how, as Andrew was saying, a continuum of practices of experiences from the worst end where people are really enslaved, they can't move, they're forced to work, all their rights are completely taken away from them; right down to exploitative labour; you know you're working overtime perhaps and not being paid for it. So a whole continuum range of experiences. In India, it is true and the majority of people who are in bonded labour are from the Dalit or tribal castes.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Can you just very briefly explain exactly what you mean by bonded labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> So, bonded labour is that people are coerced into forced labour, forced to work to pay off a debt. So they've incurred a debt often for either subsistence or to pay medical costs or marriage costs or even migration costs; in India that's what we're finding more and more is that people are migrating to work, they have to take a loan and then they end up working and not being paid and not being aware how much they owe. And that debt, then with interest, accrues and they may not be able to leave that job. They may be coerced, forced to work under threat of violence. And so there are many, many hundreds of thousands of people who are really in that very dire situation. But discrimination is pervasive in India and not everybody who is a Dalit or from a tribal group will be in a situation of bonded or forced labour.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, Beate, you heard there that our commenter doesn't believe that the ILO's figure of 21 million people can be accurate. Do you believe that it truly reflects the scale of the problem on a global level?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well, absolutely, otherwise we wouldn't have published it. But I should probably include one caveat and we said it very clearly in our report: that this is based on the best possible methodology and data available today. We think it is a conservative number, it could well be higher, it's unlikely that it is lower. But as long as we don't have reliable national estimates, we can't have a more reliable figure.</p><p></p><p>Now, of course, it depends a little bit, the scale of the problem, and the measurement depends on how you define it, that's very clear. We have based our estimate on the ILO's definition of forced labour, which means that the cases we have verified and counted as a forced labour case have to have an element or coercion. So the simple fact that you are in a vulnerable situation in itself is not forced labour. There has to be an intent on the part of the employer, the abuser, to exploit the person for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, really briefly, what conclusions do you believe we can draw from the fact that the ILO is saying that this is a conservative estimate because it's only based on the available national data that it's been able to acquire?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think there's three issues at play. One is the issue around definition; what are we talking about and where's the dividing line between what's slavery and what isn't? Whenever you have definitions that you've got to get governments to agree to you always have a race to the bottom; what's the lowest common denominator that everybody can agree on. So that then immediately skews your figures, I would argue.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, I think there's a systemic fear at government level and a society level to actually be honest and say, regardless of abolishing slavery 200 plus years ago, we still have slavery. So I think we have to have that honest debate at government level, at society level, that says this is still a problem that exists. Therefore you then get the impetus to actually shine a light on it. And that then leads to the data issue, which you know the ILO have identified it, we identified it in terms of the report that's just come out, which is to try and get hard and fast data is next to impossible for all the reasons that have just been listed. But also I think it's just this, do we want to lift this rock knowing underneath there's this gunk that we've got to look at. And my observation is we don't.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Well, thank you all.

Terms and conditions apply.</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, as we've been discussing, slavery is a global problem and I wanted to try and really unpick what are the big underlying structural causes of the modern day slave trade. Romana?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> A weak legal framework; so weak laws, weak enforcement; where we have laws they're not enforced. Discrimination, because often the people who are in situations of slavery come from groups that are marginalised in society and so they're very vulnerable. Other factors which, sort of push factors, if you like, can be conflict, migration and food scarcity issues which force families and their children out to work; it's a whole myriad really of push factors and reasons why slavery continues today and is with us today. Is that the question you asked me, I can't remember?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, have you got anything to add to that from your work collecting this data in your office at the ILO?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> I think Romana has summarised it very nicely. The key structural causes are very much linked to big institutions in a broad sense, not just laws but also ministries, governance in a broader sense. And the other one we see very clearly coming out of all of our research is indeed discrimination.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, your organisation, Unseen, was recently involved in a study looking at the scale of modern slavery here in the UK. What were the main points that you took from that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> So the Centre for Social Justice commissioned in effect what was a two-year, evidence-led review of what was the state of modern slavery in the United Kingdom. So, yes, it was UK-focused but obviously we were all aware of the global context. I think right off the top what we discovered was a lack of leadership on this issue. And probably problematic within that as well was wanting to see the issue framed just within an immigration debate. And yet if you look at the legal structure, the UK, and increasingly around the globe, what you have is legislation that views it as a criminal act. So you have a perpetrator of a crime and you have a victim of crime. And in the globalised world we need to move it away from just being a debate about immigration and I think we need to move it back to being a debate about: here is a crime that's taken place.</p><p></p><p>We also found that data was a big issue, which, in trying to ask the question what is the size of the problem, we took the decision very early on that we would not be able to answer that question. So here's a first-world country, and the UK government would admit this as well, that we have no handle on the data. The only data we have are those that have chosen to access the government's care programme. But we know, as an organisation, that isn't the true figure; and whether you talk to law enforcement, statutory agencies, everybody will tell you that is not a true figure.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And obviously behind that data are the people who are affected by this globalised labour situation. Let's hear from someone now with direct experience of being trafficked into the UK. Last week, reporter Harriet Grant interviewed a young woman originally from China, who says she was a victim of forced labour by a criminal gang. Her name's been changed to protect her identity.</p><p></p><p><strong>HG</strong> In a cramped bedsit in a northern English town Min talks about the man who brought her here from China. She tells me that her family were being harassed by the police because they were followers of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong. So her grandmother put her into the hands of a man who said he could help her get to Britain, where he said the government would offer her protection and the chance of a new life.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side. He brought me to a house where I stayed for a long time. I was just locked inside the house. They told me that I could not escape and if I tried they would kill my grandmother in China, that it was dangerous for me to escape.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>After taking a boat, then a train, still confused about where she was, their final destination was a cannabis factory in England where she was again held prisoner.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"I had to tend to the plants, water, pick them and fertilise them. They said that if I didn't my grandmother would have to pay money and that if I escaped they would kill her. I was really scared.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>In 2008, the police discovered the factory and closed it down. Despite telling them what had happened to her, Min was charged with cannabis cultivation and sentenced to 12 months in prison. It was only after she finished the sentence that the UK Border Agency acknowledged she was reasonably likely to be a victim of trafficking. Last year they wrote to Min saying that because she escaped from that situation, she cannot now be described as a victim of trafficking, even though they do accept she was under the control of her trafficker when arrested. The letter tells her that as a foreign criminal, she's now subject to deportation for the public good.</p><p></p><p>Min has a life in England now. She's pregnant and frightened about being sent home where her trafficker might find her. There's a test case at the Court of Appeal in May that is going to look at four cases similar to Min's. When I spoke to Min's lawyer, Hani Zubeidi at Fadiga & Co, he told me that he hopes these cases will set a precedent which will allow Min to challenge her own conviction. Until then she waits, unable to sleep at night, fearful of being sent home, branded a foreign criminal.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> That was Harriet Grant reporting and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/apr/07/human-traffic-victims-drug-factories\" title=\"\">you can read the full Observer article at guardian.co.uk</a>. So, Andrew, what does Min's case tell us about the failure of international efforts to tackle trafficking?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Unfortunately her case is atypical. Just going through her story, you've got issues of a misunderstanding around immigration; you have criminalisation of a victim; you have identification of that victim but then being told but you're still an immigrant therefore we're going to turf you out of the country. So not only do we not recognise the victim, but we then penalise that victim. And then that plays into other issues around what is the awareness within statutory agencies and front-line agencies of what is being presented in front of them. Is it a cannabis factory with a drug cultivator; or is it actually a victim of crime who is there against their will, who, under the threat of violence, coercion, fear of retribution to their family is held there and will work there? And then behind that you have, well, why are they in this country producing cannabis in the first place? Because society wants a demand for it. The UK is now net exporter of cannabis. So there's your pull factor into the UK. And where's our reintegration of survivors? That individual remains vulnerable. If returned to the situation where they've come from, in all likelihood will be retrafficked. And so there are so many issues at play that just basically shows you, to quote The Thick of It, an omnishambles of a response.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, do you have a response to that? Obviously, that goes back to a lot of what you were saying when you were defining forced labour for us at the beginning of the programme.</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes, absolutely. You have all the elements here: the deception, restriction of the freedom of movements, where that's a clear case of trafficking. And what it really shows is the failure of identification systems. It should have been, from the beginning, this person should have received assistance, there should have been no doubts about her circumstances. And yet it just didn't happen. And it's very symptomatic, particularly for workers and sectors that are informal, so, obviously, cannabis production is an illegal activity in most countries, but also the sex industry is a very typical, not being protected as victims of forced labour. The same is true for other activities like forced begging or more formal activities, domestic work and even construction and so on.</p><p></p><p>So I think it's a clear problem here to properly identify potential victims and then provide them with the necessary care.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> OK. And we had a question from a listener that kind of ties into this. <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/valentinacaron/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">ValentinaCaron</a>, who worked for an NGO in Cambodia, this is what she wrote to us. She said: \"It's a shame that western donors rarely include activities like police training, I'm not saying that giving money for children's education is less important, but I feel that police training could really change the legal environment in which the Cambodian people live. Without an effective implementation of the international standards that bind Cambodia, it would never be possible to have this justice.\" She's offering some kind of solution. Romana, obviously Anti-Slavery International, a global organisation, have you seen these kind of issues that play around …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Absolutely. I think we would all agree that we need better training and awareness-raising amongst law enforcement. But immigration officers, particularly on many of the borders in the global south, but also immigration officers in Europe, but all criminal justice actors. So for the UK it would be about the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, clearly being able to access, not just the police being able to identify a potential victim of trafficking but it's also the criminal justice actors all the way through, right through to judges. And also being able to communicate that to juries in trafficking trials so that clearly victims' stories are well represented because they're very complex stories often.</p><p></p><p>If we look at a couple of cases that have been held here in the UK on domestic servitude, trafficking for domestic servitude, where you've got issues around witchcraft and how children have been, or adults have been controlled through issues around witchcraft, this really needs to be unpacked, so there has to be a real understanding by all actors that are working to what are the patterns of trafficking, what are the coercive methods that are used? And what are the areas of exploitation, because as we've heard, cannabis … who would have thought that people are being trafficked into cannabis a few years ago? So this is an emerging area where now we're finding people are being trafficked into criminal activities like forced begging, many Roma and Bulgarians on the streets of London and elsewhere that are being forced to beg. And this is a new area.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Do you think that part of the problem is, is that it has evolved, it has changed? So if you ask maybe the average person on the street here in the UK: what is slavery today? they may think of children in brick kilns in Pakistan; they may not think that it happens here in the UK or in other developed nations. And I just wonder whether there was that problem with the language that's being used, people not understanding the different types of modern day slavery that are going on; what's the difference between someone who's been trafficked, what's the difference between that and migration patterns? It's a very complex language being used.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> It is complex. And it's also going back to that image of expecting people in slavery to be in chains, and it's not at all like that now. And it's not just people being locked into factories. It's also people, you know, could be working in a bar or in restaurants, in construction, so forced labour situations are really around us all the time. It's just that we're not seeing it in that sort of framework, really.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate was mentioning earlier that she felt that there had been progress made by some national governments in acknowledging this problem; I was wondering in terms of the anti-slavery movement, the NGOs, the civil society groups who are working on this issue, do you believe that you're really making an impact in global efforts to end slavery?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I think we are. Sometimes I think it's a drop in the ocean. But I think agree with Beate there has been a movement over the last few years to recognise the issue and the importance of the issue. Over the last 10 years the issue has become more and more at the top of the political agenda. Of course we're not there yet. I wouldn't want to pat anybody on the back, we need to do a lot more. In terms of civil society I think there are lots more … we've got business that are coming on board now as well, so I think it's about everybody being involved in this campaign, everybody being aware of what it is and being able to identify it and report it to the authorities when they see it.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Andrew, you actually come from a corporate background, don't you? I was wondering what your views on this might be? Do you think that things need to change if we're really going to make strides forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I'm going to be slightly controversial and I think what we've got better at is identifying it. Have we got better at eradicating it? I don't think we have. And I think it's an issue of systems process. So systems deliver processes and deliver results. And if you look across the globe and say, well, what are the results five years, 10 years, 100 years? The results are we have slaves. The results are: there are very few prosecutions. The results are: it's a high-return, low-risk industry to be involved in. And if you approach it as a commercial business, and back to what I was saying earlier about let's frame it as an illicit trade, and let's understand that the people that get involved in this and turn human beings into a commodity are doing it for business reasons, they're doing it to make money, they're doing it to get a return on their commodity. Then, are we winning? No, we're not. And I think there's a whole list of reasons why we're not. I think governments are glued to bureaucratic response and traffickers are, like, fair enough, carry on doing that, because we're fast, we're nimble, we're lean and mean and we can evolve.</p><p></p><p>So I actually think we need to be honest with ourselves, be it the NGO community, government community or the business community, and say are we actually tackling this and dismantling it? And I would say we're not. I think we can do it. I think the tools are there to enable us to do it, but is the will there, is the political will there, is the will there amongst NGOs to do it, is the will there within society to change practices that create the demand and the pulls for slavery to exist?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, our appetite for cheap products as well, I imagine?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> For sure.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I do hear what you're saying, Andrew, but I do also think that things have come a long way, honestly, in the last 10 years. We wouldn't have been having this conversation. It was really difficult to get any journalist or anybody to talk about slavery and forced labour. And just in the last 10 years, when you see the proliferation of NGOs just in the UK working on this issue. I mean for a very long time, Anti-Slavery International was one of the only organisations working, and the ILO of course, Beate of course, and so there's a lot more awareness. I mean, clearly, there's a lot more to do. Clearly, in terms of business needs to also take its responsibilities. We need a transparent supply chain which is audited and that audit needs to be transparent. And we need accountability. Governments, yes, we do need to make it more of a priority but I do think we are making steps, I don't want to be the doom and gloom merchant, there are solutions out there because I've seen communities change. Empowerment can happen quite quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, are you optimistic about the way forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> It's an area where change will only emerge very slowly, because it's linked to a change of attitudes and behaviours of different groups of people, be it government, business and the people concerned. I'd like to come back quickly on the economic interest, because Andrew is also right in saying that as long as we don't understand these economic drivers, we won't really move the agenda forward. And that's very true. I mean, that's one of the reasons why we have worked on the profit figures, we will produce a new figure this year, it's most likely to be much higher than the one you have quoted in the beginning. We need to understand the economic interest and we need to get business involved. And it's very much on the ILO's agenda.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Fabulous. So, in conclusion, we need to really understand the money and who's profiting and understand it as a criminal business as well. Well, I'm afraid that's all we've got time for today.

It said future development assistance, or aid, from the UK to Pakistan should be conditional on Pakistan's willingness and ability to collect taxes from its own citizens.</p><p>The report states bluntly: \"If the Pakistan government is unwilling to take action to increase its revenues and improve services for its people, it cannot expect the British people to do so in the long run. We cannot expect the citizens of the UK to pay taxes to improve education and health in Pakistan if the Pakistan elite is not paying income tax.\"</p><p>The reference to tax is not accidental. The IDC wants to see not only a bigger tax take in Pakistan but also more taxes coming directly from the Pakistan elite in the form of income tax. There is therefore a clear message that it is no longer acceptable for ordinary British taxpayers to finance the public expenditure that the Pakistan elite is unwilling to finance for themselves.</p><p>Pakistan is the biggest recipient of UK aid, receiving £267m in 2012-13, rising to £446m in 2014-15. The report describes Pakistan as an unstable, middle-income country with a large defence budget, high level of corruption, significant tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance and low levels of expenditure on education and health programmes. Its current tax take is no more than 10% of its gross national income, indicating a frightful lack of tax compliance – it is reported that \"over 70% of the elected representatives in Pakistan law makers, including many <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21567999-who-will-pay-pakistans-state-plugging-leaks-poking-holes\" title=\"\">ministers do not pay tax</a>.\"</p><p>The fact that Pakistan has a substantial nuclear arsenal is evidence enough that where there is a political will the state is able to operate effectively. Yet the police, the land and the tax administration operate as the most corrupt institutions in Pakistan precisely because they are of no use or interest to the elite as evidence recorded in the report makes clear. Furthermore the elite do not use the government schools and it is therefore not surprising that government-funded schools are in an extremely poor state.</p><p>The IDC report reflects the current thinking that there is a '<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/jan/22/david-cameron-golden-thread-mps\" title=\"\">golden thread</a>' to development expressed as the need to reinforce the rule of law, tackle corruption and increase tax collection. The IDC is adamant that DfID should not disengage from Pakistan in view of the levels of poverty in the country and its strategic geographic position combined with its nuclear capacity.</p><p>How then will DfID seek to leverage its resources to induce a change of attitude in the Pakistan regime?</p><p>First of all it must be realised that big as the British aid donation to Pakistan is, it is only half the value of remittances from the Pakistan diaspora. And even half of one additional percentage point of GDP added to tax revenues in Pakistan would dwarf both the UK aid and the remittances from the UK (Pakistan's GDP is estimated at $515bn for 2012). It is well known that properly planned and executed revenue enhancement projects can advance tax collections by several percentage points of GDP. They are extremely good value for money and produce a win-win scenario for donors and recipients alike.</p><p>There are many examples of revenue assistance projects supported by DfID and other donors that show dramatic increases of revenue collected, eg Uganda (5,000% increase over past 21 years), Rwanda (700% increase over 7 years to 2010) and Burundi (100% increase over the past 4 years). As an example of the efficiency of revenue assistance projects, DfID invested about £24m in the Rwanda Revenue Authority over a 12-year period to 2010. But RRA collects the equivalent of that entire investment every two weeks or so.</p><p>The IDC report rightly recommends that DfID engage on this issue with the incoming government once the results of the forthcoming elections in May are known, as experience shows that strong and committed political leadership is essential for tax reform. Britain will also need to engage strongly with the IMF and other donors to provide unified donor support for the reform agenda. Also needed is actively engaging with the Pakistani diaspora to properly explain its aid programme and seek their support. Finally, the report recommends that the Pakistan government remains committed to an anti-corruption agenda, led by the National Accountability Bureau whose principal officers, it recommends, cannot be dismissed by the president, government, parliament or the armed forces of Pakistan.</p><p>However, the report should have gone on to recommend establishing an effective modern revenue authority that uses modern business practices and is properly financed and supported with appropriate technical expertise.</p><p>The fact that revenue assistance projects are great value for money and they assist governments in bringing in significant revenues, much greater even than the value of the development assistance itself, indicates that this is a policy well worth pursuing.</p><p><em>Kieran Holmes is head of Burundi's new revenue authority.

BSG Resources then acquired those rights, agreeing in return to invest $165m to develop what it described as \"a world-class integrated mining project\".</p><p>In April 2010, Steinmetz negotiated to sell half his company's stake – a quarter of the mountain's ore – to Vale of Brazil, the world's biggest iron ore miner.

The 57-year-old Israeli tycoon was estimated by Forbes magazine to have a net worth of $4bn. But while Steinmetz's corporation defended the deal in which it acquired the rights, others were highly critical: the African telecoms billionaire <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mo-ibrahim\" title=\"\">Mo Ibrahim</a>, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/15/guinea-corruption-which-side-is-west-on\" title=\"\">asked publicly</a>: \"Are the Guineans who did that deal idiots, or criminals, or both?\"</p><p>When Guinea's first democratic government was elected later in 2010, Alpha Condé, the new president, began scrutinising the terms of several mining concessions granted under Conté's rule. He focused firmly on the Simandou deal.</p><p>With the assistance of one of his advisers, the wealthy investor and philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/george-soros\" title=\"\">George Soros</a>, the new president assembled a team of investigators who, it is understood, have unearthed a number of documents that shed light on the way in which the Simandou deal had been sealed.</p><p>There were reports that a number of luxury gifts and payments had been made to relatives and associates of Lansana Conté, and to senior officials in the short-lived military dictatorship that followed his death.

BSG Resources responded to this allegation by saying that the car was worth no more than $2,000, and had been given to the mining ministry, not an individual, in a ceremony that was held in public.</p><p>Claims that Conté had been given a diamond-studded gold watch, and that a substantial commission – as much as $2.5m – had been made to his wife, Mamadie Toure, were flatly denied.</p><p>The development of the mine stalled after Conde's election.

That figure  is likely to reach at least 10 million, more than half the pre-war population of the country.</p><p>Another UN body, Unicef, says half of those currently in need are children.</p><p>\"I don't remember any other crisis where we are having 8,000 per day [fleeing across borders], every day since February,\" Guterres said in an interview with the Guardian. \"There will very likely be 3.5 million by the end of the year. We will have half the population of Syria in dire need of assistance and this is incomprehensible.</p><p>With the civil war now into its third year and increasingly taking the shape of a proxy regional war fought on a sectarian faultline, aid groups are making ever more strident predictions of a catastrophic funding shortfall.</p><p>Guterres goes further, warning that the modern boundaries of the Middle East and the post-Ottoman agreements that underpin them may unravel if the crisis is not brought to an end.</p><p>\"The political geography of the modern Middle East emerged from the Sykes Picot agreement with the exception of the never-resolved Israeli-Palestinian situation,\" he said of the Anglo-French deal at the end of the first world war that eventually formed the nation states of Syria and Lebanon. \"The conflict in Syria might for the first time put that political geography into question.\"</p><p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, this week both warned of a partition of the country that would inevitably cause grave ramifications in neighbouring Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and beyond.</p><p>Kerry appeared to advance the US position on Syria by suggesting an \"enclave break-up\" could only be prevented by getting \"everybody on the same page with respect to what post-Assad Syria will look like\".</p><p>Assad, meanwhile, reiterated his earlier warning that no country in the region would be safe if the Syrian war, in which a majority Sunni opposition is fighting a minority Alawite regime aligned to Shia Islam, led to the collapse of the embattled state's  borders.</p><p>UNHCR figures show that close to 1.3 million Syrians have fled the country in the past two years. The figure is markedly less than the numbers that left Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade, but is increasing at a faster rate  than at any point in either country.</p><p>In addition, there are thought to be at least 3 million internally displaced Syrian refugees, many of whom have limited means to provide for themselves or their families. Communities in Syria's war-ravaged north, west and south are  largely without electricity and low on food and running water.</p><p>Refugee camps in northern Jordan, southern Turkey and Lebanon's Bekaa valley are overwhelmed with daily arrivals of refugees who have often made precarious journeys to escape nearby battlefields.</p><p>\"This is the most brutal [conflict], even with very brutal conflicts elsewhere,\" said Guterres. \"If one looks at the impact on the population, or the percentage of the total population in need, I have no doubt that since the end of the cold war it is the worst. And it will become even worse still if there is no solution.</p><p>\"My belief is that if we take all of these elements, then this is the most dramatic humanitarian crisis that we have ever faced. Then if we look at the geopolitical implications, I have no doubt that this is the most serious that we have ever dealt with.\"</p><p>Lebanon and Iraq are increasingly unable to deal with the Syrian spillover, which is disturbing already fraught sectarian power bases and straining meagre resources during an economic downturn brought on by the crisis.</p><p>\"There is a real threat to Lebanon and Iraq,\" said Guterres. \"Jordan is under serious economic stress. We have the Palestinian/Israeli question and the fact that the Syrian army has withdrawn from the Golan Heights. In the context of the Sunni-Shia divide, all the key actors are involved.</p><p>\"Even compared to Afghanistan, the geopolitical implications and the threat to global stability are profound. It's the most dangerous of all crises.\"</p><p>In an address to the United Nations security council on Thursday, Guterres said there had \"not been an inch of progress towards a political solution\".</p><p>Expanding on that to the Guardian, he said: \"It is of enormous frustration that we have come to such a situation in global governance that nobody can address it.\"</p><p>Diplomacy on Syria has failed to bridge a yawning divide in views on what has fuelled the crisis and how best to deal with it. Russia and China, two permanent members of the security council, have blocked moves towards more robust support of the opposition in Syria. The US and Europe have attempted to impose ever-tougher sanctions on the Assad regime, but have baulked at arming the opposition because of concerns about the influence of al-Qaida groups.</p><p>\"I lived in a bi-polar world,\" said Guterres. \"Until the war in Iraq, I witnessed a unipolar world with one single superpower. Now we are in a clearly established multi-polar world. New actors have emerged – the Brics: China, Russia, Brazil, India. There is no longer a clear set of power relations. There is no way to bring about consensus among global players, or to bring about  common action. There is no capacity to produce any solution.\"</p><p>UN appeals for aid to Syria remain desperately under-funded with some agencies, including Unicef, reporting a shortfall of more than 70%. The crisis was eased somewhat on Thursday when Kuwait transferred $300m to the UN for Syria relief. \"[It] will be distributed across all of our institutions,\" said Guterres. The Kuwaitis are the only country of the Gulf that has honoured its promise through the multilateral aid organisations.</p><p>\"We can now put some money up front in Syria, but we are all in big trouble. Most of the western countries have huge budget difficulties. Moving towards 3 million refugees, there is no way that this can be dealt with.</p><p>\"The system is at breaking point. There is limited capacity to take many more. Where are the people going to flee? Into the sea?\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/refugees\">Refugees</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/aid\">Aid</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-chulov\">Martin Chulov</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And it will become even worse still if there is no solution.</p><p>\"My belief is that if we take all of these elements, then this is the most dramatic humanitarian crisis that we have ever faced. Then if we look at the geopolitical implications, I have no doubt that this is the most serious that we have ever dealt with.\"</p><p>Lebanon and Iraq are increasingly unable to deal with the Syrian spillover, which is disturbing already fraught sectarian power bases and straining meagre resources during an economic downturn brought on by the crisis.</p><p>\"There is a real threat to Lebanon and Iraq,\" said Guterres. \"Jordan is under serious economic stress. We have the Palestinian/Israeli question and the fact that the Syrian army has withdrawn from the Golan Heights. In the context of the Sunni-Shia divide, all the key actors are involved.</p><p>\"Even compared to Afghanistan, the geopolitical implications and the threat to global stability are profound. It's the most dangerous of all crises.\"</p><p>In an address to the United Nations security council on Thursday, Guterres said there had \"not been an inch of progress towards a political solution\".</p><p>Expanding on that to the Guardian, he said: \"It is of enormous frustration that we have come to such a situation in global governance that nobody can address it.\"</p><p>Diplomacy on Syria has failed to bridge a yawning divide in views on what has fuelled the crisis and how best to deal with it. Russia and China, two permanent members of the security council, have blocked moves towards more robust support of the opposition in Syria. The US and Europe have attempted to impose ever-tougher sanctions on the Assad regime, but have baulked at arming the opposition because of concerns about the influence of al-Qaida groups.</p><p>\"I lived in a bi-polar world,\" said Guterres. \"Until the war in Iraq, I witnessed a unipolar world with one single superpower. Now we are in a clearly established multi-polar world. New actors have emerged – the Brics: China, Russia, Brazil, India. There is no longer a clear set of power relations. There is no way to bring about consensus among global players, or to bring about  common action. There is no capacity to produce any solution.\"</p><p>UN appeals for aid to Syria remain desperately under-funded with some agencies, including Unicef, reporting a shortfall of more than 70%. The crisis was eased somewhat on Thursday when Kuwait transferred $300m to the UN for Syria relief. \"[It] will be distributed across all of our institutions,\" said Guterres. The Kuwaitis are the only country of the Gulf that has honoured its promise through the multilateral aid organisations.</p><p>\"We can now put some money up front in Syria, but we are all in big trouble. Most of the western countries have huge budget difficulties. Moving towards 3 million refugees, there is no way that this can be dealt with.</p><p>\"The system is at breaking point. There is limited capacity to take many more. Where are the people going to flee? Into the sea?\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/refugees\">Refugees</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/aid\">Aid</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-chulov\">Martin Chulov</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It has, however, had its challenges. When I arrived in 2001, after being chief executive of Macmillan, there were financial problems, a failed restructuring and a crisis of confidence. We were spending more and earning less, and the organisation just didn't know where it was. I had to make a lot of redundancies so it was an extremely painful time. I have since had to work very hard to rebuild confidence within the organisation.</p><p>I think as a chief executive you need huge amounts of confidence and optimism. It is quite surprising how quickly organisations can turn in on themselves and be very self-critical, particularly in the voluntary sector. I see it as a key part of my role to keep people facing forwards and outwards. You have to stick to key priorities, know what you do well, and be prepared to say no – which is often very hard. While being chief executive at the BRC I have recognised that there are a million needs out there and we can't fulfil all of them.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for your organisation?</strong></p><p>We are in good shape now. We have a strong income and we are doing great work at home and overseas. My ambition for our work internationally is to put a lot more effort into building the capacity of Red Cross societies overseas to help them to respond to their own disasters and their own health care emergencies. There are now 186 national <a href=\"https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/responding/disaster-response-system/dr-tools-and-systems/red-cross-red-crescent-national-societies/\" title=\"\">Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>, many of which are in Africa and south Asia where they don't necessarily have the financial resources to meet the needs they face in their country. It is incredibly important therefore to really develop the capacity of those societies to meet their own challenges.</p><p><strong>The BRC is currently running an appeal for Syria. What insights have emerged from your work there?</strong></p><p>The criticisms of the international response to Syria have been warranted: it has been belated and it has been too little. While we have launched an <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/syriacrisis\" title=\"\">appeal for Syria</a>, progress has been slow, and we undoubtedly need much more aid and support. Our experience there has confirmed that building capacity must begin before disaster or conflict strikes. It has also confirmed that the Red Cross needs to work much harder at getting our role – as a neutral and impartial actor – fully understood not only among governments and their armies, but among the opposition. This will enable us to have greater impact and reach those that need us. Working there has been extremely dangerous, and we need more support from governments and opinion formers around the world to help reduce the dangers for aid workers.</p><p><strong>How can we expect to see the BRC evolve over the next decade?</strong></p><p>You will become more aware of us because we are developing our advocacy work. We have always been an organisation that is strictly neutral and impartial, but we are not impartial in terms of meeting need. Neutrality and impartiality are key parts of our <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/The-international-Movement/Fundamental-principles\" title=\"\">fundamental principles</a>, but I think that the organisation began to see these – in some situations – as a real gagging order on the way we operated. What we have recognised over the past few years is that in a conflict situation lives literally depend on us being impartial. But in other situations – if needs aren't being met – actually we should be anything but impartial.</p><p><strong>What is the future of development?</strong></p><p>Development and humanitarian assistance is at a crossroads. In terms of fundraising, people are increasingly questioning the impact organisations can actually have. Accountability and transparency are incredibly important for all of us and we need to get better at demonstrating the difference we can make with the help of people's support. We constantly need to justify our existence; we can never be complacent. The approach to emergency response is also evolving: the future is about disaster preparedness, resilience and local capacity building.</p><p><strong>Where did your interest in development come from and how has it led to where you are today?</strong></p><p>I started life as a commercial lawyer at one of the big city law firms. Although I enjoyed the excitement of the deals, I also became increasingly disillusioned with making big companies get bigger. I realised that the voluntary sector, in very general terms, was more likely to satisfy the urge I had to make a difference in the world. I initially worked at the BRC as director of UK operations before becoming chief executive of Macmillan. It was at Macmillan that I really learnt how to fundraise in a big organisation, which is a crucial for working in the voluntary sector, and something I took to my current role back at the BRC.</p><p><strong>Reflecting on your career, what would you say makes a good development leader?</strong></p><p>First, you have to be passionate: the day I stop being moved by what I see in the field, is the day I really need to get out. Second, it is important to maintain energy in the face of fearful odds. It is very easy to be demoralised by how much need there is out there, and sometimes what we can achieve feels like a drop in the ocean. Third, it is really important to believe in the people in your team and the local communities where you are working.</p><p><strong>Who is your development hero?</strong></p><p>First and foremost, I find heroes in the communities we see affected by disasters. It never ceases to amaze me how quickly people bounce back and begin to reestablish their lives. I have also been inspired by <a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=109469979&privcapId=6659326&previousCapId=639004&previousTitle=SEAF\" title=\"\">Jan Egeland</a>, who was secretary general of the Norwegian Red Cross and then went on to become head of the <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/\" title=\"\">United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a>.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth.  Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core  idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace.  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example.  So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible.  </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO.  </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\"  </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave.  </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google.  </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet.  </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet. North Korea, I now understand, has its own internet. They have people copying the content that the respected leader thinks is OK and they put it on internal servers and they call that the internet. That's the crudest and least effective strategy, in my view.</p><p>Let me give you some examples of what governments could do. There is something called the DNS, which is the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DNS.html\">Domain Name Service</a>, which is how you get to things, so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">guardian.co.uk</a>. If you go in and you programme that in a certain way, you can actually delete things. You can also, at the protocol level, lock ports, so you can block, for example, access to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> in its entirety. So those have the property that it's not a flat open internet but rather it depends on which country you're in. </p><p>There are things called VPNs. The Chinese Government, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/13/china-cracks-down-on-vpn-use\">plays a game we call whack-a-mole</a>, where every time a VPN shows up, they shut it down and people move. Using modern encryption there are ways of getting even more sophisticated versions of this kind of thing working. The problem is that if you put these restrictions in place, the elites will figure out a way to get around it, but the average person won't, because they don't have time, or knowledge, or education, so there's a real loss of information. </p><h2>On education</h2><p>What's the number one education problem in the developing world? Literacy and childhood education. Can we solve that? Absolutely, at a 100% level. We simply preload phones with all that teaching material. You do it in their local language and, because people are going to be using their phones, they might as well use them to learn how to read. That's easy.</p><p>What's the next problem? The developing world don't have textbooks. So what's another solution? Preload their tablets. We have the textbooks for maths and science, in their languages. </p><p>So now let's talk about college. Well in college you've got new online courses, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">they're called MOOCs</a>, and the anecdotal evidence is that 90% of the viewers are not from the US, and the majority are not from the developed world. That tells me that if you go to Rwanda, Kenya, so forth, you've got an incredibly smart person who does not have textbooks and is hungry for the latest college and graduate school level education, they're going to get it online. </p><p>So what do you need for that? You need bandwidth. If you're in a city in those countries you're going to get that education. If you're in a rural area, you may not, unless those governments are smart enough to get the 3G/4G networks out to the rural areas. </p><p>In South Sudan we asked, \"How do you get information to the people who are in north Sudan, or the Sudan people the government is busy hurting?\" The simplest way to get them information is to smuggle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/sep/16/guardian-android-app-faqs\">SD cards</a> in - you know, the tiny little SD cards, because everybody has a phone.  </p><p>They turn out to be incredibly cheap, incredibly standardised, and it's a great way to get information about what's really going on in the world to closed societies. Even if you don't have an internet connection, or your internet connection is too expensive, you could have an SD card which would have the information that I'm describing. And these SD cards are getting more and more powerful.  </p><p>People in the developing world are much more clever than we think because they have to work with what they're given. So they'll find a way to solve their information problem with the tools at hand, and this SD card is an example.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/privacy\">Privacy & the media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange\">Julian Assange</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks\">WikiLeaks</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones\">Mobile phones</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/tablet-computer\">Tablet computers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea\">North Korea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth.  Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core  idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace.  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example.  So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible.  </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO.  </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\"  </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave.  </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google.  </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet.  </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet. North Korea, I now understand, has its own internet. They have people copying the content that the respected leader thinks is OK and they put it on internal servers and they call that the internet. That's the crudest and least effective strategy, in my view.</p><p>Let me give you some examples of what governments could do. There is something called the DNS, which is the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DNS.html\">Domain Name Service</a>, which is how you get to things, so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">guardian.co.uk</a>. If you go in and you programme that in a certain way, you can actually delete things. You can also, at the protocol level, lock ports, so you can block, for example, access to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> in its entirety. So those have the property that it's not a flat open internet but rather it depends on which country you're in. </p><p>There are things called VPNs. The Chinese Government, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/13/china-cracks-down-on-vpn-use\">plays a game we call whack-a-mole</a>, where every time a VPN shows up, they shut it down and people move.
