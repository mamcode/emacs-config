Later in the year sees a new version of The Three Musketeers, plus several pirate dramas and  other historical epics. Is it all too much swashbuckling and sorcery?</p><p>The problem with a show becoming a hit is that suddenly every one else wants a piece of the action. Thus, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/lost\" title=\"\">Lost</a>, we were inundated with overly complex dramas filled with secrets and cryptic clues (Flash Forward, The Event, Alcatraz); without <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad Men</a>'s Emmy success, it is unlikely networks would have been desperate to commission either Pan Am or The Playboy Club.&nbsp;And now,&nbsp;thanks to the success of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a>, viewers are being treated to a whole raft of historical fantasy shows.</p><p>Take <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/apr/16/da-vincis-demons-reinvents-leonardo\" title=\"\">Da Vinci's Demons</a>, which starts on Fox this evening. The eight-part drama recasts the renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci as a charming rogue with an eye for the ladies, often seen flashing his chest while fending off assorted enemies. Or the new version of the Three Musketeers, coming to the BBC next year, starring Peter Capaldi as Cardinal Richelieu and Skins actor Luke Pasqualino as D'Artagnan. Sorcery and swordplay, it seems, will become even harder to escape from the schedules.</p><p>Elsewhere, US TV networks have two pirate dramas in the mix: Black Sails, a Treasure Island prequel in which, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/michael-bays-black-sails-trailer-441447\" title=\"\">judging by the eight-minute trailer</a>, Michael Bay indulges his twin desires to watch women kissing and blow things up a lot, and Crossbones, which stars John Malkovich as Blackbeard and is scripted by Luther's Neil Cross. Meanwhile, a big-budget version look at the life of Marco Polo produced by Harvey Weinstein is in the works at American cable channel Starz.</p><p>Over here, the BBC has clearly decided that the best way to imitate Game of Thrones's blend of backstabbing and betrayal is to strip away the fantasy trappings and head back to George R R Martin's original inspiration: the <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1496\" title=\"\">War of the Roses.</a></p><p>Later this year they will air <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPBg9KK3gYo\" title=\"\">The White Queen</a>, a 10-part adaptation of Philippa Gregory's War of the Roses-set novel. That will be followed in 2014 by the much-anticipated BBC take on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a>'s Wolf Hall starring Mark Rylance as arch-conspirator Thomas Cromwell.</p><p>Yet, while it is easy to understand the rush to imitate the hugely successful Game of Thrones, do we really want to be subsumed in a sea of historical fantasy? As someone who owns a much-cherished box set of Sean Bean's Napoleonic war series <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C8IuThoWuU\" title=\"\">Sharpe</a>, I'm always open to a certain amount of swashbuckling and bodice ripping. But even the biggest fan can worry that the bandwagon may be in danger of tipping.&nbsp;</p><p>With Da Vinci's Demons,&nbsp;it soon becomes clear that it's not quite as clever as Game of Thrones which is a great shame because in its better bits – the throwaway one-liners, the mischievous playing with history – Da Vinci's Demons feels a little like Sherlock or Merlin in tone (and it is no surprise to note that it is a BBC Worldwide co-production). It is a show that should work as&nbsp;great,&nbsp;blockbuster family entertainment but is instead trying too hard to be dark and edgy and adult.</p><p>But what do you think – will you be watching Da Vinci's Demons? Which of the other new shows would you watch? Can anyone replicate the success of Game of Thrones? And is there really room in your life for two pirate dramas?

Easy: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s1c4y\" title=\"Brushing Up On\"><strong>Brushing Up On&nbsp;–</strong></a> (BBC4). Brushing up on what? Tunnels, obviously: something, says presenter Danny Baker, all human beings are obsessed with. I'd like to have sat in on the meeting at which this one got commissioned (if that's how these things happen). So, Danny, you want to make a programme about tunnels? Like a documentary, but not really a documentary, because you're not finding anything out, or doing any reporting? And although there is a factual element to it, some of these facts have no basis in truth and are quite clearly plucked from your (over) vivid imagination? More like standup than documentary, then. Tunnel-based comedy, hmmm …</p><p>On the plus side, you don't need to go anywhere, apart from the BBC archive to dig out some old footage of tunnels and people tunneling, around which you can twist your tale. And toss in a few cheap graphics. It's only going to cost about a 140 quid to make, including your fee. You know what, let's do it!</p><p>I imagine that's how it went. In which case that commissioning editor is a bit of a hero, because the result is a little treat. The story of the Channel tunnel starts in 1802 with Napoleon, who was going to build an island (like Boris's) halfway across. It ends in 1990 with a man whose name (Graham) came out of the (hard) hat; he got to go through the hole to meet the Frenchman (Phillippe) who had been digging from the other side. In the 188 years in between, there's plenty of xenophobia; a man in a suit who trips up again and again; a comedy Frenchman saying \"bonjour\"; a machine that digs itself into a hole, dies, and then gets bought for £20,000 by a man named Ron; and&nbsp;more.</p><p>It's not just about the Channel tunnel, though. It's about hot Irish men, \"with iron in their arms and their buttocks\", building the London underground. It's about the tunnels under the Thames, and Swampy, and David Bellamy, and badgers, and a man named Don who watches the badgers.</p><p>It doesn't all work. At times it's hard even to know what Baker is on about. Some of it I think might actually be wrong (like the Dartford tunnel may have two lanes but these days they both head north, so, contrary to what DB says, the only way IS Essex). Who cares though, because so much of it is a joy. The word \"buttocks\" IS funny, as are men called Ron and Don; though not as funny as a man in a suit tripping over, on repeat; and the sentence: \"So you'd recommend fish-farming in a German war tunnel, then?\" from some old footage from the Channel Islands, is one of the greatest ever uttered.</p><p>It comes out so fast too. It's as if there's a fire hydrant on Baker's forehead, it's turned on full, connected to a high pressure hose and aimed at you, and you're being splurt-blasted by his words and wit and wisdom. No, maybe not wisdom. Imagination, then, and a lot of weird stuff, some of which is about tunnels. Fabulous. Bring on the bridges next week.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s0zvx\" title=\"Maureen Lipman: If Memory Serves Me Right\"><strong>Maureen Lipman: If Memory Serves Me Right</strong></a> (BBC1) was one of those documentaries that involves a non-expert celebrity going on a journey of discovery triggered partly by events in their own lives. You know the ones. So Maureen's finding out about memory, partly because her father lost his, and she's worried about hers. There's a bit of science, a bit of psychology, a bit of Paul McKenna, quite a lot of blah. She's amiable company, but the film is meandering, inconclusive, unmemorable.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s0zqv\" title=\"Could We Survive a Mega-Tsunami?\"><strong>Could We Survive a Mega-Tsunami?</strong></a> (BBC2) was one of those what-if documentaries (thankfully, no lame drama element to this one: they're the worst). In fact, more of a what-when one, because this is going to happen. There's going to be a volcanic eruption and half of La Palma, one of the Canary islands, is going to slide into the sea. No great shame, you might think, but this will unleash a massive CGI wave three times the height of the Shard that will take out New York just like in The Day After Tomorrow, though less convincingly because this CGI wave doesn't have a Hollywood budget behind it.</p><p>They're screwed then, over there. What about us, though? Well, not great if you're in Penzance, I'm afraid. Brighton? Touch and go. But tucked away snuggly and smuggly round the corner here in London? I'll be fine, thank you.</p><p><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/3f8h9/tw via @guardian\" title=\" Watch this: TV highlights\">• Watch this: TV highlights</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://tvlistings.guardian.co.uk/default.aspx\" title=\" Full TV listings\">• Full TV listings</a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/danny-baker\">Danny Baker</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samwollaston\">Sam Wollaston</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The idea being education, the station being the school that pompous village leader Akbar Khan is secretly intent on blowing up.</p><p>This sort of thing would have been wonderful in the 80s – a worthy play adapted from an actual Afghani soap opera (<a href=\"http://www.pactradio.com/en/drama/news/bbc-radio-4-to-broadcast-a-season-of-the-pulay-poray-drama.php\" title=\"Pulay Poray\">Pulay Poray</a> in this case), boiling down the nuances of life and culture on the borderlands to two familiar dramatic tropes: arranged marriages and angry fathers. But it feels lazy and a bit dull in 2013. The mish-mash of accents delivered by the actors doesn't help, the lack of ambition even less so.</p><p>One radio show profiling another radio show should be too meta a concept to really work, but Judith Kampfner pulled it off for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01rv0m0/Archive_on_4_Radiolab/\" title=\"Archive on 4s look at Radiolab\"><strong>Archive on&nbsp;4's look at Radiolab</strong></a> last weekend, offering a solid primer on the cult US phenomenon broadcast on 300 American radio stations and downloaded as a podcast by 2 million listeners each week. What makes it so successful, asked Kampfner, and why are fellow broadcasters so in awe of it? Even Ira Glass, presenter of <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/\" title=\"This American Life\"><strong>This American Life</strong></a>, was floored. \"They heard what we were doing and took the whole thing further,\" he cheerfully admitted. \"The aesthetic is much more evolved … it's more interactive, dynamic and fun.\" High praise.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\" title=\"Radiolab\"><strong>Radiolab</strong></a> skipped its usual format (esoteric science chat and brainy soundscapes) for a special reading by actor Liev Schrieber. What if the moon was just a jump away, asked hosts Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich.

Looking back on those introductory episodes now the show has finished on Sky 1, they are really not that different from what followed; Spartacus started with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q94bZ0NyJEg\" title=\"everything turned up to 11\">everything turned up to 11</a> and never flagged. The always entertaining dialogue was as stylised as the action: \"You scale a mountain of ifs and I would add to its peak.\" It was up to you to get used to it; if you did, you'd be hooked on a show that constantly delivered the goods.</p><p>It also tragically lost its Spartacus when cancer took lead <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPfga7VitA\" title=\"Andy Whitfield\">Andy Whitfield</a>. While he was ill, after season one (Blood and Sand), a short prequel series (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou2TvLK9jzg\" title=\"Gods of the Arena\">Gods of the Arena</a>) kept the show going and expanded the back-story of the many supporting characters, turning the show into more of an ensemble piece. John Hannah's furiously ambitious <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW2sNb1cd-w\" title=\"Batiatus\">Batiatus</a>, Lucy Lawless as his equally <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUEj3mvrLbU\" title=\"ruthless wife Lucretia, Manu Bennetts Crixus the undefeated Gaul\">ruthless wife Lucretia, Manu Bennett's Crixus the undefeated Gaul</a>, Dustin Clare's swaggering gladiator <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s71sZrOlJHk\" title=\"Gannicus\">Gannicus</a>, Nick Tarabay's stupendously duplicitous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKMI2f1xkA0\" title=\"Ashur\">Ashur</a>: the show was full of memorable characters that it had no worries about killing off (it's no surprise that almost everyone dies, that's the kind of spoiler that is usually taught in schools).</p><p>When Whitfield's replacement, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJdh6yJBJpQ\" title=\"Liam McIntyre\">Liam McIntyre</a>, joined the show for series three, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNdutDDCUQU\" title=\"Vengeance\">Vengeance</a>, and the final <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qXoC-DykyM\" title=\"War of the Damned\">War of the Damned</a>, his Spartacus was suitably more sullen, less cocky, still as unrelentingly hateful of the Romans as before, but bearing the weight of a man who was fighting not just for revenge of his murdered wife, but for freedom for all. Knowing how it ends doesn't diminish its power; rather it comes loaded with a crushing inevitability. With no wasted episodes, Spartacus never drags its sandalled feet.</p><p>It turned out to be an extremely tightly plotted affair, the storytelling as flab-free as the athletic cast, full of twists, surprises, and such never-before-seen-on-TV things as a bridge made of corpses and a gay couple (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2J6p5lCFrA\" title=\"Agron and Nasir\">Agron and Nasir</a>, dubbed Nagron by fans) who make it to the end without anyone commenting on their sexuality. You get blood and gore but so much more.</p><p><br />Reading this on a mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qXoC-DykyM\">Click here to view video</a></p><p>The levels of violence are insanely high; the screen is surreally sprayed with gore, and the fight choreography surpasses movie quality. But the violence is not used just to look cool – see, for instance, the episode Decimation, where we learn the proper use of the word, as 10% of a Roman squad are harrowingly beaten to death. It's inventive too: just when you think you've seen every combination of hacking and slashing a body apart, along comes the scene where Spartacus slices the entire front of someone's head off. That's variety for you.</p><p>While it wouldn't have been made were it not for the success of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol67qo3WhJk\" title=\"Gladiator\">Gladiator</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDiUG52ZyHQ\" title=\"300\">300</a>, Spartacus ended up outclassing those high-grossing movies in almost every department, save popularity. The virtue of the long-form storytelling (39 episodes in all) is that even when a minor character dies it has the impact of losing, if not an old friend, then at least a long-term acquaintance. And the finale must be one of the most emotionally violent ever televised, with a message, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYRGF0GWTD4\" title=\"delivered in Spartacuss pre-battle speech\">delivered in Spartacus's pre-battle speech</a>, that rings through the ages as he fights for those \"forced to toil and suffer while those in coin and position see their fortunes grow beyond need or purpose.\" 'Twas ever thus.</p><p>The Starz Channel's Spartacus is one of the TV highpoints of recent years – or at least it would be considered so, had it gathered more viewers. It may yet be regarded as such, for if there was ever a show that benefited from the boxset format, it's Spartacus. Watch a few episodes. If you don't like it then watch a couple more, because when it takes, you'll be gripped and put through the wringer.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/spartacus\">Spartacus</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/historical-drama\">Historical drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phelimoneill\">Phelim O'Neill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If they are as good as the first documentary, we are in for a treat</p><p>In February, Channel 4 aired <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-fried-chicken-shop-life-in-a-day\" title=\"\">The Fried Chicken Shop</a>, a one-off documentary set in a London fried chicken shop. Using the same fixed-rig setup that the channel loves to return to again and again, The Fried Chicken Shop took a week's worth of footage from Clapham's Roosters Spot eatery and distilled it into a tightly packed hour of entertainment. And it was much more fun than it had any right to be.</p><p></p><p>This week, Channel 4 announced that The Fried Chicken Shop is to return for three episodes that will repeat and expand on the premise of the original. We will still see the Roosters Spot staff grind out one impossibly long shift after another. We will still see Clapham's finest slumped over the counter at chucking-out time, manfully attempting to order a Mega Mix chicken burger with their last remaining molecule of dignity intact. But this time, we are promised, we will also get to follow some of the takeaway customers home. This new addition will almost certainly contain the most exciting footage of a lonely man sitting on a carpet in a bedsit and silently eating chips at 2am that British television has ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The beauty of The Fried Chicken Shop is its universality. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/24-hours-in-ae\" title=\"\">24 Hours in A&E</a> and feel admiration for the medical staff and their ability to maintain composure under extraordinary pressure. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-hotel\" title=\"\">The Hotel</a> and wonder why any of the guests agreed to let cameras into their rooms. But to watch The Fried Chicken Shop is to recognise a part of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Plenty of us, at one point or another, have bought fast food while drunk. Many of us will have done so without a second thought for the staff behind the counter. What The Fried Chicken Shop did so well was to make it clear how awful we probably are when we do this.  Judging by the show, the staff of Roosters Spot have put up with it all: aggressive drunks; attention-seeking drunks; people pretending to be disabled; drug dealers handing out business cards; and social media hipster dullards, who function as an argument for sawing a circle around the edge of London and letting it drop into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Watching the staff remain as good-natured and professional as they were in the face of such soul-sapping arsery was a joy. It was as heartwarming as anything else I have seen on television this year. And although it had the potential to lapse into the uncomfortably sneery classism that Channel 4's Gypsy programmes sometimes revel in, The Fried Chicken Shop staunchly refused to judge anyone. It didn't have a point to make, or an issue to force home, other than the awkward \"Wow, don't people eat a lot of chicken these days?\" message tacked on to the start. It was happy enough just to show us the chicken shop and let us reach our own conclusions. The first episode was magnificent. I can't wait to hang out there again.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fast-food\">Fast food</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food & drink</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuart-heritage\">Stuart Heritage</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

What can it do to win back disgruntled fans?</p><p>There is a problem on the Square. Sure, there have been the usual tear-stained wedding dramas, squalling rows in the Queen Vic and near-incestuous couplings, but something is wrong: E20 has lost its edge. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/eastenders-facing-ratings-crisis-angry-1771100\" title=\"\">Ratings have been on the slide for more than a year</a>, while forums have been filling up with disgruntled fans. To put it like a Walford local: wossgaoinon?</p><p>Well, for a start, there are the recycled storylines. It's been a staggering 20 years since the angry baby that is Phil Mitchell first seduced his brother's breathy wife Sharon. Now, like a market-stall knockoff of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2310171/EastEnders-Phil-Mitchell-finally-gets-girl-Sharon-Rickman-succumbs-brutish-charms.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">they are at it again for a third time</a>. It's a plot so lacking in excitement that on Monday night, the cliffhanger ending was Sharon's six-year-old son (complete with Ann Widdecombe haircut) threatening to run away from home.</p><p>Stuck in a similarly boring rut are Max and Tanya, who have also been splitting up and getting back together on a loop since they first arrived in Walford, the London borough where marriages go to die. After several affairs, attempted murders and short-lived relationships with other people, Max has left Tanya once more – this time for Kirsty, whose larger-than-life lips, eyelashes and hair extensions have been stuck on in place of a personality. But inevitably Max is yet again pining after Tanya – a situation so predictable even the couple's children merely roll their eyes in response.</p><p>On top of this there are the non-plots – actual screen time was devoted to discovering who had stolen Dot's cold cuts from the fridge. And then there are the really unbelievable ones. Such as Masood, the square's nicest father figure, dating 19-year-old Ayesha, before the writers shamefacedly let it fizzle out. To cheer us up,  they've since put together attractive Denise and slimy egomaniac Ian Beale as the square's supposedly hilarious odd couple. But seeing as the soap operates a strict looks-blind policy to casting – with Phil Mitchell and Max as the square studs while Ray has been confined to the Fox sisters – it's hardly the most shocking of hookups.</p><p>Despite a cull of characters last year (I am still in mourning for the loss of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2248900/Nina-Wadia-quits-EastEnders-years-playing-Zainab-Masood.html\" title=\"\">Zainab Masood</a>), Eastenders still has some great ones – Kim is hilarious, Shirley does tough vulnerability brilliantly, and Kat and Alfie still have an impressive amount of chemistry. But instead of giving them some depth and storylines to progress with, there has been an emphasis on bringing back old favourites to bring back some sparks. When in truth, we don't want the same old faces but some new plotlines to put the drama back in to the doof doof endings.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/drama\">Drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/soap-opera\">Soap opera</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/homa-khaleeli\">Homa Khaleeli</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It contains spoilers both about the specific episode and the story as a whole.</em></p><p>Two years earlier, the Silurians had proved a triumph, the story of a dormant pre-human race rising to reclaim the planet brought a spectrum of grey to Who. Unwilling to broker a deal to share the planet, the Brigadier had ordered their destruction. It was ripe for a sequel, and so producers decided to repurpose the story, this time with a marine setting. The Sea Devils doesn't quite have the bleak undercurrents of its predecessor but the scale and execution of this bring it out on top for me.</p><p>The co-operation of the navy meant the episode could live up to its blockbusting ambitions, and it's a a technical triumph packed with vintage moments: speedboats, swordfights, reversing-the-polarity-of-the-neutron flow and the Master watching The Clangers from his island prison. Oh yes, the Master; Roger Delgado is on electrifying form here.</p><p>This was at the height of the Doctor's Earth-bound adventures, as the Timelords exiled him to our world just as the show got colour. There was a lot of talk of The Bells of Saint John channelling James Bond a few weeks back, but Jon Pertwee's action-packed era was a closer cousin to 007 in the Roger Moore days. Unit – the military organisation for whom the Doctor is working as scientific advisor – doesn't feature here, but its buttoned-up British pomp is all over this navy-themed tale.</p><p>Of an impressive guest cast, most memorable is Martin Boddey as gluttonous minister Walker, ordering missile strikes in between mouthfuls of cake. The Sea Devils goes down as one of the most memorable Pertwee stories of all, and it's tricky to pick a best episode when the reach is so cinematic. So how about that cliffhanger to episode three, with that first monster emerging from the sea, surely one of the most memorable sequences in all of Who?</p><h2>Life aboard the Tardis </h2><p>The Timelords had exiled the Doctor to Earth, so there was no gallivanting round space and time in the third Doctor's early years. But there was a terrific ensemble in the Unit family, with a special favourite in Katy Manning as Jo Grant, one of the most beloved companions of all. Brought in to replace scientist Liz Shaw, whom producers had decided was a little too accomplished, Grant reversed the template of companions asking lots of questions. And she went round making an awful lot of tea without even being asked. But what the junior civilian operative for the UN lacked in progression, she more than made up for in fierce loyalty; the relationship between her and Pertwee's Doctor is one of the most tender in the show's history, and Katy Manning herself has gone on to be one of Who's proudest ambassadors. </p><h2>Behind the sofa </h2><p>The turtle-like\" sea devils\" (though never actually named as such) go down as a design classic, their menace only slightly undercut by the hospital fatigues they appear to be wearing. And that Silurian set-up, that someone was here before us is, as Steven Moffat noted in recent years, a \"movie franchise idea\". But The Sea Devils isn't in itself a scary story. And like the any Master story, the show is stolen by Roger Delgado's masterclass in polite psychopathy, returning after a year off. After being captured in The Daemons, he was imprisoned, and claiming to be reformed. But as the unfortunates at the prison soon discover, you can't keep a bad Timelord down; he's soon manipulating the governer and taking people down with his Jedi mind tricks.</p><h2>Behind the scenes </h2><p>The hovercraft sequence is also responsible for one of the fruitier production anecdotes. As Katy Manning recalls on the DVD extras, the vessel tipped over slightly to one side, leading to a \"nautical rugby scrum\". As she said with a cackle: \"It was a pretty exciting moment actually. I had something like 24 sailors on top of me, now there's a memory! I said to them afterwards: 'I'm going to have to marry all of you; we've just been too close,' and Jon was actually deeply concerned, he was not happy about that moment.\" (The production proved even more challenging for Delgado, who couldn't swim.)</p><h2>Fragments</h2><p>• \"Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\", might be the third Doctor's most famous catchphrase, but he actually only ever used it twice: here, and in his anniversary comeback in The Five Doctors.</p><p>• I tweeted Manning at the weekend to tell her I was watching her in The Sea Devils. She replied:</p><p>I'm not quite sure what that means.</p><p>• Another iconic sequence here is the sight of what is quite clearly a burly stunt guy's bottom standing in for Manning. The man in question was named Stuart Fell.</p><p>• The Doctor, we learn, was a close personal friend of Horatio Nelson.</p><p>• Would they really have kept fencing swords right next to the prison cell of a dangerous criminal?</p><h2>Further reading </h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/seadevils/detail.shtml\" title=\"\">The official BBC page, with the usual list of amusing goofs.</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2009-12-14/doctor-who-the-sea-devils\" title=\"\">A Radio Times re-appraisal from a few years ago</a>.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080629134959/http://www.gallifreyone.com/review.php?id=3l\" title=\"\">And here's a review from those sensible people at Outpost Gallifrey</a></p><h2>Next time </h2><p>The one with the Maggots!

Its creator/star also has a book of essays, called Attempting Normal, published at the end of this month. But just four years ago, by his own admission, Maron <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/? read=\"interview_maron\"\" title=\"\">\"had nothing going on\"</a>. Having made his name in the 90s alternative comedy scene, he had lost touch with his more famous peers, including Louis CK and Patton Oswalt. Twice-divorced and fired from his third radio hosting gig in four years, Maron moved from New York to LA with three cats and few prospects. The 49-year-old's current career revival is all thanks to his hugely popular podcast, WTF, a twice-weekly interview show where he has swapped laughs and neuroses with everyone from Sarah Silverman to Robin Williams.</p><p>Now he's following in the footsteps of Scott Aukerman, whose improv podcast Comedy Bang! Bang! was also adapted for television by IFC, and Chris Hardwick, creator of The Nerdist podcast. Not content with one TV show, Hardwick also fronts a post-Walking Dead discussion called Talking Dead, has filmed a pilot for Comedy Central and last month launched the first series of the Nerdist TV show for BBC America. While he gained notoriety presenting cheesy dating shows in the 90s, it took a podcast to give him credibility. And he's not the only one.</p><p>Aisha Tyler is probably best known for playing Ross's girlfriend Charlie on Friends, but her Girl on Guy podcast made a wider audience aware of her comedy roots. As a result, she was announced as the new host of Whose Line Is It Anyway? last month and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Self-Inflicted-Wounds-Heartwarming-Tales-Humiliation/dp/0062223771/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365974995&sr=8-1&keywords=self+inflicted+wounds\" title=\"\">has her own book coming out this summer</a>. Meanwhile, comedian Pete Holmes has parlayed the success of his podcast You Made It Weird into <a href=\"http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/02/26/pete-holmes-conan-obrien-late-night-show-tbs/\" title=\"\">an upcoming sketch show</a>. And although it wasn't true, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-nbc-renews-carson-daly-alec-baldwin-rumors-20130410,0,453985.story\" title=\"\">a recent rumour</a> that 30 Rock actor Alec Baldwin would take over Carson Daly's late-night talkshow seemed plausible thanks to the interviewing prowess he has shown on his own podcast, <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/\" title=\"\">Here's the Thing</a>.</p><p>When podcasts started back in 2004, few people realised their career-boosting potential. Pioneers such as Jesse Thorn and Dan Klass made quality shows that attracted loyal audiences and media coverage. But when I fired up my first MP3 player in 2005, I listened to a lot of podcasts that featured unintended sound effects and prolonged drunken giggling fits. Their creators often described them as \"homemade radio shows\" and that was exactly how they sounded.</p><p>They have become considerably slicker since then. To be a comedian in the US without a podcast is increasingly to be an oddity. It may even be a liability. Podcasts are a becoming an easy way for TV networks to find fresh talent with an established following. The potential for them to be used as a springboard to writing, acting, and presenting jobs is huge.</p><p>But they haven't taken off in quite the same way in the UK. Here podcasts tend to be drawn from popular radio shows made by established media corporations (such as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-danny-baker-show/id330285088\">Danny Baker's BBC podcast</a>) rather than original, independently produced content. One exception is The Ricky Gervais Show, which Channel 4 adapted into an animated series in 2010. But Gervais had established a career in entertainment long before he hit \"record\".</p><p>So why are up-and-coming comedians in the UK less interested in building a millions-strong audio audience than their US counterparts? Perhaps because we have a more thriving live scene – America has no real equivalent to the Edinburgh festival, and the comparative size of our countries means it's far easier for British comedians to build a following by touring. Or it may just be that we're a step behind. Either way, it's a shame.</p><p>Cheaper and easier to put together than a YouTube production (and marginally less likely to attract incendiary comments), podcasts can provide a low-risk, low-cost way to try out new material, and not just for comedians. Releasing chapters of his audiobooks as podcasts helped <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/books/01podb.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\" title=\"\">Scott Sigler become a self-publishing superstar</a>. Perhaps it's time for writers and performers on this side of the Atlantic to take note – and pick up a mic.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/comedy\">Comedy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy\">Comedy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/podcasting\">Podcasting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media\">Digital media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/comedy\">Comedy</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dianeshipley\">Diane Shipley</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes one and two</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/apr/11/mad-men-season-six-episode-one-two\" title=\"\"><em>Catch up with Paul MacInnes's episode one and two blog here </em></a></p><p><strong>Episode three: The Collaborators</strong></p><h2>'It's just filled with profanity, marijuana smoking and simulated sexual acts … Oh, and a few songs' – Pete Campbell<br /></h2><p>The reign of Pete Campbell as the most unpleasant lothario in Cos Cob did not last long and neither was it edifying to watch. Determined to indulge himself as retribution for being made to live in the suburbs, Pete's first conquest was driven deeper into mental illness and his second ended up the victim of domestic violence. The ultimate consequence of this appears to be the immediate end of Pete's marriage. So at least something good came out of it.</p><p>Pete always seemed an unlikely type to inspire uncontrollable desire in women. His narrow-set features have something of the rodent about them, or perhaps a stoat. He's weedy and pale and seems shorn of any sense of romance (the spartan decor of his shag pad for, example, makes it look like something closer to a dungeon). This by the way, is without even touching upon the subject of his character which, when all's said and done, hardly works in his favour either.</p><p>Yet at the very beginning of this episode we get the distinct sense that Pete has beguiled not one but two neighbourhood women, while their husbands are stood in the next room. Those men, it has to be said, are in turn quite crassly chatting up Trudy Campbell. The conclusion one is reluctantly expected to draw from this juxtaposition is that Pete, by comparison, is a sophisticate. Topped off with his references to Hair, it seems the guy's a regular bohemian too.</p><p>So maybe Pete is simply taking advantage of a suburban desire for frisson. Or perhaps his neighbour, Brenda, just wanted access to a bolthole each time she came to Manhattan to shop. Either way, the next we see of her she's dressed like Jackie O and entirely willing to succumb to Pete's plodding advances.</p><p>Just a few days later, Brenda spills into the Campbells' sitting room, her nose bloodily busted and her husband's howl of \"You're Campbell's problem now\" trailing immediately behind. Pete plays the situation much as you'd expect: short of sympathy on the one hand and with cunning on the other. He suggests Brenda make her own way to a hotel in the middle of the night, before suddenly offering a lift when he realises his wife might drive her instead and find out the truth along the way.</p><p>That the truth does come out means the final scene in the Campbell household ends with Pete being instructed as to the scope of his micturatory privileges (he's not allowed to open his flies within 50 miles of his home). When she tells Pete she has decided to end their marriage, Trudy reveals a lot that we have really not seen before. She has proven cannier than we are often led to believe; she knew exactly what Pete's pad was intended for. She is also stern, clear and deliberate – less the subservient partner, more the daughter of a Vicks Chemical executive. Pete leaves the family home and dosses down in his office. </p><p>****</p><p>Away from the suburbs and back to the big city, where everyone's scrapping over condiments. There's an air of the ridiculous about proceedings, with people speaking in hushed tones of how \"beans brought in ketchup\" and asking themselves \"what can we do for ketchup?\" The reality for both <a href=\"http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/Sterling_Cooper_Draper_Pryce\" title=\"\">SCDP</a> and <a href=\"http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/Cutler_Gleason_and_Chaough\" title=\"\">Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough</a> is more serious, though, as Ken watches his ambitious plans being stifled and Ted Chaough plans to take advantage of a loose set of lips.</p><p>Ken's plan was simple: get beans to bring in ketchup and then, despite the expressed wishes of beans, run away with ketchup, the Coca-Cola of condiments. It was a simple plan and one entirely in keeping with the unsentimental nature of his business, but it was scotched by Don. Don felt that beans were owed some loyalty, that \"sometimes you gotta dance with the one that brung ya\". That hokey justification was entirely sentimental and entirely inconsistent with Don's subsequent, brilliant undermining of hideous Herb from Jaguar. Herb had brought Jaguar to SCDP and wanted them to change their strategy for his benefit and pitch it to his bosses too. Don did just as he was asked, but did it so egregiously that Herb's higher-ups refused to take the advice. An act of solidarity with Joan guided Don's actions, a personal act that may yet undermine his business interests.</p><p>There's nothing personal in the way that Ted leaps all over the news that Heinz ketchup might be up for grabs. Well there is, I guess, in that Ted sees SCDP as \"the enemy\". There's certainly no sentiment though as Peggy's accidental revelation of her late-night conversation with Stan, leads to the preparation of a brief the very next morning. Betraying information is how wars are won, Ted tells Peggy. \"He underestimated you.\"</p><p>****</p><p>Flashbacks are back back back. We know that Dick Whitman came from the school of hard knocks and, also, from the school of knocking shop. Here we get to see his time in the whorehouse. We are introduced to Ernestine the madam and Mack the rooster and Charlotte the prostitute in a scene that's eerily down home, all full of pleasantries and sweet swing music in the background. Later the tone changes starkly enough as Dick watches Mack having sex with his pregnant stepmother through a keyhole.</p><p>An elegant segue follows this scene as the camera pans past a sullen Dick, through the whorehouse wall, and out into the corridor of Don's apartment block. Don is there, shuffling towards his front door having allowed his priapism to take him to the verge of a disastrous encounter with Sylvia Rosen. He's just a gigolo, the old time song tells us, whose youth will pass away. (And what will they say of him then?) That Don's sex drive comes partly from a compulsion to demean his better self becomes clearer as time goes on.</p><p>****</p><p>As yet, Megan Draper has not a clue about her husband's infidelity and neither does she know he feels the pair are \"drifting apart\". She is, however, experiencing traumas of her own. An unplanned pregnancy in Hawaii is followed by a miscarriage and not only is Megan unable to share this event with anyone, it confirms in her another secret; her unwillingness to have children at all.</p><p>This is all worked out through a spontaneous confession to Sylvia in the washroom and, later, a dishonest conversation with Don. On both occasions, Megan's pain is coloured by her self-involvement. She assumes a sympathetic hearing from Sylvia, only to find that a shared Catholic upbringing resulted in very different moral codes. With Don, meanwhile, she jumps on an open-ended offer to have a conversation about children \"whenever you want\", to avoid the question altogether.</p><p>Don raises his eyebrows at this and we see that his willingness to accept Megan's indulgence of her own interests is limited. We also know, however, that Don is a hypocrite. He may think his desire to start another family is the normal, responsible thing, but he also feels free to ignore familial responsibilities. There is a generational difference between this couple, but they share a common selfishness.</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>We're only at episode three but already Bob Benson is making inroads. He's earned the trust of Pete, who allowed him to buy the most intimate of products for him. He's worked his obsequy on Herb with enough success to be granted the role of office tour guide. What next? A blowback from Stan?</p><p>We've not seen enough of Joan Holloway so far this season but she has been afforded one zinger of a line. In response to Herb's nauseating insistence that \"I know there's a part of you that wants to see me,\" she replies: \"I know there's a part of you that you haven't seen in years.\"</p><h2>Time stamps</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.clemson.edu/caah/history/FacultyPages/EdMoise/viet8.html\">Tet offensive</a> was one of the most notorious events in the Vietnam war, as the Viet Cong took advantage of a ceasefire (for the Vietnamese new year) to unleash brutal assaults on several south Vietnamese cities. These assaults were, in turn, crushed equally brutally by US and South Vietnamese forces. When this news is announced during this episode, Don and Sylvia pay no attention, too busy discussing the etiquette of dinner between adulterous couples.</p><p>The greatest conspiracy theory of the 20th century – who killed Kennedy? – was about to get a leg up as a Louisiana district attorney Jim Garrison <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shl-F5qHN4U\">revealed to the American public</a> his belief that Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone.</p><h2>Culture club</h2><p>Hair: The American Tribal Love Rock Musical, to give it its full name, made its debut off-Broadway in 1967. It transferred to Broadway in the spring of 68 and slightly revised its bonkers premise for a broader audience. One of the changes involved turning the character of Claude from a space alien to a human. Its subsequent success may have lain partly in such revisions, but also in the fact it wasn't nearly as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/theatre/2009/04/13/090413crth_theatre_als\">counter-cultural</a> as it thought it was.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/drama\">Drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/historical-drama\">Historical drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulmacinnes\">Paul MacInnes</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But Davina makes the daftest ideas watchable</p><p>Any idiot can present a daytime television gameshow. Just look at the schedules for proof. On any given day this week, the bored and housebound are asked to endure gameshows presented by estate agents (Phil Spencer's The Common Denominator), DIY men (Nick Knowles's Perfection), retired PR types (Nick Hewer's Countdown), newsreaders (Dermot Murnaghan's Eggheads) permanently corpsing comedians (Bradley Walsh's The Chase) and genuinely objectionable, insanely dressed egomaniacs (Deal or No Deal).</p><p>But while it's true that any idiot can present a daytime gameshow, it takes someone special to make a daytime gameshow that's actually worth watching. It's for this reason that I have become slightly addicted to Davina McCall's new show <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/five-minutes-to-a-fortune\" title=\"\">Five Minutes to a Fortune</a>.</p><p>Five Minutes to a Fortune should be terrible. Because it's a daytime gameshow – and daytime gameshows are only commissioned if they come with a set of rules so impenetrably convoluted that they may as well be written in Chicomuceltec – I won't explain exactly how it works here. The key thing to know is that there's a giant egg timer filled with 50,000 £1 coins that drain away as a contestant answers questions. If they answer the questions quickly, they keep the money. If they're slow, the egg timer sprays a fat sneeze of coins out into oblivion after every round, diminishing the total prize.</p><p>At first, the whole thing comes off as a pointlessly opportunistic poor cousin of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-million-pound-drop-live\" title=\"\">Million Pound Drop</a>. \"Hey,\" you can see some high-ranking Channel 4 department head shouting in a boardroom, a torn-off ratings printout clutched to their chest. \"The kids love TV shows about Davina McCall watching money fall through stuff! She's the queen of watching money falling through stuff! Someone invent me another show for Davina to present. But – and I have to make this as clear as I possibly can – money has to fall through stuff. It has to.\" Hopefully if Five Minutes to a Fortune becomes as successful as Million Pound Drop, we'll get another show featuring McCall watching money fall through stuff. Maybe one where contestants have to dig postal orders out of a gutter with a coat hanger. It'll be brilliant.</p><p>Anyway, despite all this – and despite other wobbly factors, like the show's infinitely stupid \"STOP THE DRAIN!\" catchphrase – Five Minutes to a Fortune is an endlessly enjoyable television programme. And much of that, it has to be said, is down to the McCall. Davina is famously Good With People. She took Streetmate's creepy premise and made it warm and enjoyable. She single-handedly held Big Brother together by being empathetic and understanding instead of, say, obliviously shrieking platitudes at housemates such as Brian Dowling did during his thankfully curtailed tenure as host.</p><p>And now she's the secret weapon in Five Minutes to a Fortune too. Most people, if they ever found themselves in Davina's position, would become so completely worn down by the thought of having to repeat the show's needlessly complicated rules to a procession of actual morons again and again that they'd eventually snap and take a blind swing at a contestant's head. Not Davina, though. She's the picture of grace throughout. Even when, as with yesterday's episode, she has to spend what seems like a full calendar year trying to communicate the names of former Doctor Who actors to a struggling nitwit via a series of increasingly strangulated mimes and yelps.</p><p>If a gameshow lives or dies by its host, then McCall has ensured that Five Minutes to a Fortune will last a very long time indeed. Long enough for people to fully understand all of the show's rules? Maybe. That's how much fun it is.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/game-shows\">Game shows</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/daytime-tv\">Daytime TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/entertainment\">Entertainment</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuart-heritage\">Stuart Heritage</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now the brothers are about to appear on TV together again</p><p>An enduring tale of sibling harmony, Gary and Martin Kemp have spent decades working companionably alongside one another without ever, publicly at least, succumbing to fraternal combustion. The arts, and particularly pop music, is&nbsp;littered with brothers (more so, curiously, than sisters) who have tried to do the same and failed, among them Ray and Dave Davies of the Kinks and Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis, each undone by ego and the need to dominate. But the Kemps are different, an anomaly. Now&nbsp;both in their 50s, they remain essentially one and the same, and consequently stronger together than the sum of their parts.</p><p>But how? Gary Kemp, who, at 53, is two years Martin's senior, thinks that it is down to their upbringing. \"There were only four of us in our family: my mum, my dad, me, him. They were devoted to us, and we were devoted to&nbsp;them. It was them that gave us our sense of responsibility to one another, our moral compass. We've never lost it.\"</p><p>Initially, they were both child actors, often being cast alongside one another. Then, in the late 70s, they formed Spandau Ballet, new romantic goliaths with an unusual sense of fashion and a gift for mainstream balladry. The band ultimately split acrimoniously, but the Kemp brothers' partnership remained intact and, in 1990, they revived their first love, acting, playing Reg and Ronnie Kray in The Krays. They have dabbled in music and acting ever since, sometimes apart, more frequently in&nbsp;tandem.</p><p>This month, they return to the small screen, fronting the documentary Gangs of Britain, in which they explore British gang culture past and present. As ever, they make a good team, but do they never get sick of working with each other? Do they not crave a little autonomy?</p><p>Gary smiles. \"Not really, no, because we get on, we complement each other. Also, we're different people, with different personalities. What Martin does, I would never attempt, and vice versa, I think.\"</p><p>Is this true? To the viewing public at least, this is less clear. Surely casting directors could request either of them?</p><p>Gary remains insistent. \"No really, we are completely different. I'm more hyper, he is more laidback. I'm a control freak, I've always lusted for cultural things. Martin is more physical, more charismatic.\"</p><p>\"Charisma always was the important thing to me,\" Martin says. \"I joined Spandau Ballet not because I wanted to be the best musician in the world, but because I wanted to be Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando.\"</p><p>\"Sexual attraction,\" Gary suggests.</p><p>Martin chuckles. \"Yes,\" he says. \"I&nbsp;wanted that.\"</p><p>When I meet the Kemps in their PR offices, both look immaculate: suited and booted, hair swept back, their jawlines, up close, improbably strong. Gary is, indeed, the more hyper, the more effusive, while Martin has clearly learned plenty from watching Brando. Sitting in a large armchair that seems too small for him, and interlocking his fingers, he doesn't say much, but instead broods with a quiet intensity.</p><p>They were born and brought up in Islington, north London. Their father was a printer, their mother a seamstress, and they were latchkey children who joined a drama club for want of anything better to do after school. But in the 60s, the local Anna Scher children's theatre drama club was to British television what the Brit School is to today's pop charts: a conveyor belt of readymade talent. They were soon appearing in children's TV programmes and small films. At 16, Gary, a Bowie obsessive, started a band, and when they required a new bassist, he asked Martin not because Martin had any musical prowess – he hadn't – but because \"he was the coolest guy we knew, always popular with the girls. If anyone was going to get us magazine front covers, it was him.\"</p><p>Alongside Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet dominated the early 80s with their flash swagger, but success was tempered by boiling backroom rivalries. \"Me and Martin would fight occasionally, sure,\" Gary says, \"but no&nbsp;one could ever take sides because it&nbsp;would blow over in no time. If I argued with Tony [Hadley, the lead singer], on the other hand, it would be a disaster. It could have gone on for weeks – for ever.\"</p><p>\"It did,\" says Martin, laughing.</p><p>Band harmony ruptured, seemingly irrevocably, in the late 80s, but when the band finally split in 1990, the Kemps landed on their feet. That same&nbsp;year, the film The Krays established their acting careers, though neither achieved as much big-screen success in its wake as they had hoped. In the mid-90s, Gary decamped to Los Angeles to give Hollywood a go. Martin soon followed. \"We were going up for the same auditions a lot of the time, obviously,\" Martin says, \"but we understood that; there was no getting around it.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, they did try, by having separate agents. \"But,\" says Gary, \"sometimes Martin would get a script I&nbsp;hadn't been sent, and it was difficult not to phone my agent and say, 'Hey, he's got it, why haven't I?'\"</p><p></p><p>Both returned to the UK, and in 1998 Martin landed a major role in EastEnders. I ask how Gary felt about this and he tells me I'm forgetting something. Three years earlier, Martin had been diagnosed with a brain tumour – two, in fact. \"It was a terrible time. I felt awful for him, and so guilty. I was the older brother, and here he was with this terrible disease, not me. So when he got better and landed EastEnders, all I felt was pride and relief.\"</p><p>\"That was the main reason I took the part,\" Martin says. \"I'd had three years of illness. I needed to change that, to leave that part of my life behind.\"</p><p>In January 2009, illness tested them again when they lost both parents within four days of one another. \"An absolute disaster,\" Gary says. Their mother had been sick, and was in hospital for a heart operation. The family visited her one day, but by the time they got home, their father was behaving strangely. Complaining of a whooshing in his ear, he said he needed the toilet. \"He was in there a long time. I called out to him, and he said: 'I'm all right, boy.' But his voice sounded strange.\"</p><p>He had had a massive heart attack. Moments later, Gary was in the bathroom giving his father the kiss of life. He died a few days later. Telling their mother was the hardest thing he has ever had to do. \"She simply didn't want to live. She gave up.\"</p><p>But in this decision, he says, there was a kind of solace, peace, even. \"Our parents had never spent a day apart. They were so devoted, so old-fashioned, really. With him gone, she was lost. She looked around her and said: 'All is fine.' What she meant was, my wife was about to have a baby, Spandau were getting back together again after 19 years, and she was confident that both me and Martin were happy. So she was right, everything was fine, and she could go. Two days later, she was gone. We had a joint funeral.\"</p><p>Today, Gary lives in central London with his second wife. He has four sons. Martin and his wife live in Herefordshire with one daughter and one son. Their families socialise a lot, and the brothers will continue to work together. They would like to do more documentaries, and are in discussion to co-direct a film. The union has been fruitful so far, why stop now?</p><p>\"Mum and Dad were fantastic parents, and they instilled a lot of pride in us, a lot of love,\" says Gary. Martin nods solemnly. \"We've taken a lot from them, I think,\" he says. \"Me and Gary, the way we are – it's all down to them.\"</p><p></p><p><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/gangs-of-britain.html\" title=\"\"><em>Gangs of Britain</em></a><em> begins on the Crime & Investigation Network, Sky Channel 553 at 9pm on 21 April</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock\">Pop and rock</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/drama\">Drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/soap-opera\">Soap opera</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nick-duerden\">Nick Duerden</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When somebody tells him one, he says, he feels as if he's being mugged – the buildup, the promise that he'll find this one funny, the forced reaction. Ugh. Nothing worse.</p><p>Bailey is possibly the world's least likely rock'n'roll comedian. It's not just the aversion to old-fashioned one-liners; it's the way he tells his non-jokes (cerebral shaggy dog stories that don't always conclude with much of a laugh) and his appearance (shoulder-length half-head of hair and mad, staring eyes, like something out of the Hobbit). But rock'n'roll comedian he is. He sells out stadiums, does world tours, has his share of obsessive fans and struts the stage with guitar in hand. He has a thing for progressive rock, and in a way his epic tours are like classic 1970s concept albums. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/nov/10/bill-bailey-review\" title=\"\">Dandelion Mind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/jan/07/bill-bailey-gielgud-review\" title=\"\">Tinselworm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2004/nov/07/comedy\" title=\"\">Part Troll</a>, Cosmic Jam: even the names of the shows evoke prog rock. In his latest, <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk/tour/\" title=\"\">Qualmpeddler</a>, he confronts his myriad doubts about the modern world via religious dubstep, folk bouzouki,  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a>, rare planetary alignment, Spice Girl reunions and more.</p><p>We meet at his Hammersmith office, which is every bit as bonkers as you might hope. Every object tells an unlikely story. There's the vintage clarinet-reed vending machine picked up in Philadelphia; a load of french horns that he bought as a job lot and turned into wall lights; a massive Bill Bailey Toblerone bar propped up on a grand piano (the manufacturer gave him mountains of the stuff for a piece he was doing about hoarding for the apocalypse); and a huge, terrifying bird.</p><p>What is that owl thing, I ask.</p><p>\"That 'owl thing' is a Eurasian eagle owl.\" It's stuffed, but looks pretty lively at first glance. \"It's a gift from my wife, because we rescued one from a Chinese restaurant last year.\" Where? \"In China. So it's a reminder of that.\"</p><p>How did he rescue an owl from a Chinese restaurant? \"We bought it. It was on the menu. It&nbsp;was a live owl, in a cage, on the menu waiting to be eaten, and we haggled with them for a bit and bought it for $400. We put it in a taxi, drove up to the woods, and let him go. I talk about it in the new show. Our son was with us at the time. He was eight then, and he filmed it on his little camera. There's this very sweet film I show at the end of the standup show, of us releasing this owl. The camera's a bit jiggly, then you see the owl emerge out of this carboard box, and then it flies off.\"</p><p>The stuffed owl in the office is massive. \"Yes,\" Bailey says. \"It is. It's the largest. My wife Kristin is a collector of oddities like this.\" Are you sure this isn't the owl that was on the menu? He grins. \"It may be! I&nbsp;am quite tempted to bring it out at the end of the show and say, 'We changed our minds! We were going to release it, but we thought no, fuck it, it looks much nicer in the office.' \"</p><p>This being Bailey, he's not quite finished yet. There's a bit more knowledge to impart. \"The Eurasian eagle owl is an apex predator, so you can release them anywhere in the world and they would be fine. An apex predator means that nothing preys on it.\" There follows a quick class on apex predators, humans, jaguars and the South American jungles.</p><p>He has an astonishing ability to soak up obscure knowledge and incorporate it into his act. As a boy, he says, his mind was a sponge. He grew up in Bath as Mark Bailey – he was nicknamed Bill by his music teacher, becase he played the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET1X96SyWMI\" title=\"\">Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey</a> so beautifully on his guitar. He was an only child, to a doctor father and nurse mother, and spent much of his time chatting with adults, mining them for knowledge. He sees his own son, also an only child, doing the same thing now. He'd tell tall stories, and often wonder how he'd dreamed them. \"You spend a lot more time on your own as an only child. And there's space to allow your imagination to take flight. If&nbsp;you're bouncing ideas off someone, you take it one way and they take it another, wherereas if it's just you, there are no constraints.\"</p><p>Was he ridiculously clever? \"I won't lie to you,\" he says. \"At school I found it easy. Every year I got the prize.\" Was it a posh school? \"Not particularly – it was direct grant. All boys. And every year for the first three years they said, 'OK, the English prize is Bailey', then geography, history, maths, physics, everything. One year I won them all.\"</p><p>His fellow pupils must have despised him. \"They did. 'Ah, you bloody swot.'\" It gets worse,&nbsp;Bailey says. He&nbsp;wasn't simply brilliant academically – he was great at everything. \"One year I was captain of the cricket team, and the lead in the school play. Fair play to the English teacher who decided on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui\" title=\"\">The Resistible Rise Of Arturo Ui</a> – good on yer.\" Bailey's never been backwards at coming forwards: even today, his promotional material stresses that he's not simply messing about with comedy music – he's pitch-perfect.</p><p>Did he hate himself for being good at everything? \"I sort of did. I rebelled against it, and by the fourth and fifth year I just went off the rails.\" He stopped trying, stopped winning prizes, and joined a band. Going off the rails is all relative, though – he still managed to get an A in his English A-level. He started studying for an English degree, but gave up after a year. \"I was restless. I&nbsp;wanted to get on, be challenged a bit more. I suppose there is a natural sense of rebellion somewhere along the line. At school, I&nbsp;was bored with the teachers, and there were moments where I felt they were singling me out… I suppose because they thought, 'Oh, here's a student we can get great results with', and I&nbsp;resolutely refused to go along with it. The same at university. I just got bored with it.\"</p><p>For a decade or so, he drifted, travelling across&nbsp;the globe in search of the meaning of life (spending lots of time in Indonesia, where he's off to later this afternoon), following any hippyish trail he came across, but also working – touring with a theatre company, playing in bands, doing comedy.</p><p>Back then, he even told jokes. Lots of them: short and punchy, the ones he can't stand. He was part of a double act, working at the <a href=\"http://www.jokerclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Joker Comedy Club in Southend</a>. One night in 1994 the owner rang to tell him the closing act had dropped out and asked if Bailey could do an emergency shift.</p><p>\"But my partner Martin was on holiday. He said, 'Can't you just do it on your own?' I&nbsp;went, 'I&nbsp;don't know if I can', and he said, 'Well, here's the money', and I went, 'Oh, I get the same money if it's just me! I'll do it.\"</p><p>He did the gig, and it was disastrous. \"The Joker is quite raucous: they like their comedy and they let you know one way or the other. Then some bloke said, 'Oi, mate, tell us a joke!' I&nbsp;thought, 'Oh my God, I can't think of any jokes at all.' So I went, 'OK, three blokes went into a pub', and straight away there was attention because this was something the audience could respond to.\"</p><p>The problem was, there wasn't a joke at the end of it. He&nbsp;didn't have a clue what he would say next.</p><p>\"I'm thinking, 'I'm so in the shit here.' So I said, 'I say three – it was probably more like four or five', and that got a couple of laughs. Then I said, 'Well, I say five – it was 10. OK, 10 blokes go in a pub', and I&nbsp;say, 'OK, there were quite a few more than that – 20-30 blokes', and then it was 100, 200, a village, a small town, an area of Holland, northern Europe, and it went on and on, extrapolating this thing from three to most sentient blokes. 'OK, the entire male population of the world goes into a pub and the first bloke goes up to the bar, and says, I'll get these.' And I&nbsp;said, 'What an idiot!' And it got a huge laugh, and I&nbsp;thought: that just came out of nowhere.\"</p><p>It was a revelation. Bailey realised that was what he actually enjoyed – deconstructing humour. And if he could get a laugh in the process, so much the better. \"What I'd been doing up till then was not really what I'd been wanting to do. It was like a facsimile of a comedy act: it was what we'd seen other people do. It was jokes and one-liners and songs, but it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I'd settled for it.\"</p><p>He thought if he'd managed to dismantle a&nbsp;joke&nbsp;in front of such a tough, beery crowd, he&nbsp;could develop this. So he went on to tell jokes&nbsp;set&nbsp;in the 1950s, in Shakespearean and Chaucerian times, about all sorts of unlikely subjects – and the skill of these anti-jokes lay in the telling rather than in the punchline, which often didn't exist anyway.</p><p>What happened to poor Martin? \"Well, he came back from holiday, and we did some more gigs, and then I said, 'I want to do this on my own now', and he said, 'Yeah, all right, fine.' We parted amicably. He went on to work for a photo archivist, which suited him down to the ground, because he was obsessed with cataloguing.\"</p><p>So Bailey had become an accidental surrealist. And after a long wait, his career took off quickly. In 1995, he won a Time Out comedy award; the next year he was shortlisted for the Perrier at Edinburgh. His act was more wordy than Proust, his humour was clever and gentle, most of his non-jokes were accompanied by music, and he appealed to people who liked to think of themselves as being on the smart side. He was also virtually impossible to categorise. I&nbsp;ask if he can explain his humour. And he's stumped.</p><p>\"Well …\" He takes a deep breath. \"It's a mixture of different elements: straightforward standup, observational, a bit of politics, a bit of philosophical discourse, a bit of interaction with the audience where I try to subvert the nature of&nbsp;audience participation. Then there are various musical sections of the show, where the music is&nbsp;observational, so it's not a parody per se: the music is the joke. So, for example, I bemoan the&nbsp;fact that the church has lost its influence in&nbsp;society – the church was always a big part of my childhood; now people don't take it seriously. The church has lost touch with the youth, they need to try to re-engage, so I&nbsp;imagine writing a piece to promote the church using dubstep, so we have an organ section, which turns into dubstep, which turns into an animated film in which the Archbishop of Canterbury turns into a ball of hair, which kills the devil with lightning... Hahahaha!\" He's laughing not at the sketch, but at the impossibility of explaining it. \"I can see your problem.\"</p><p>Has he ever tried to break it down like this before? \"No! No! I'm trying to draw the elements together.\" Cognitive dissonance apparently comes into it somewhere – \"something we all experience, but we maybe don't know we do\".</p><p>Now I'm having to ask him for an explanation of his explanation. What's cognitive dissonance? \"It's when there are two opposing thoughts in your head which seem to cancel each other out, yet you're able to hold them simultaneously. Smoking is a classsic one. 'This is bad for me; I&nbsp;like smoking.' You recognise the dissonance in those two thoughts. So I say to the audience, 'You all know what this is', and they think they don't, but they do. <em>That's</em> what I&nbsp;like to do,\" he says with a click of his fingers, as if he's just got it. \"I get people to realise that they know all these things.\"</p><p>Because he's so mellow most of the time, it's easy to forget that Bailey is a political comedian – or at least a comedian with politics. Once, when he was asked what he thought about Tony Blair, he found himself on the front pages. \"I&nbsp;just came out with some involuntary eruption. Among the general ranting, it came out as 'warmongering legacy junkie'. It could equally have been 'legacy-mongering war junkie'.\" But, he says, his contempt for Blair is nothing compared with that for today's government. When he turns to George Osborne and David Cameron, he's almost incoherent with rage. \"This is different. This is more like a horror, a deep horror: to see how this confidence trick is being played out in front of everybody. It's evil genius. The hideous, two-headed Osborne-Cameron creature just frightening you with the utterly amoral … It's almost brilliant, the way they have turned our justified and rightful anger against bankers on to 'benefit scroungers'. How do they do that?\" He comes to a stop, bewildered.</p><p>There's something <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/in-depth/reith_1.shtml\" title=\"\">Reithian</a> about his humour, I&nbsp;suggest: inform, entertain and educate. \"Yeah! Yeah! I&nbsp;do have that,\" he says enthusiastically. \"I&nbsp;want it to be more than you just come and have a laugh. Obviously, first and foremost, that's what it's about – people pay their money and they want to have a laugh and take their mind off the fact that the high street is closing down and their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/11/jessops-shuts-stores-1370-job-losses\" title=\"\">Jessops vouchers are no longer valid</a>. But there's also a&nbsp;bit of wanting people to come along and go away with something. 'You know what? I know what cognitive dissonance is now. I know who wrote this piece of music.' \"</p><p>Bailey has thoroughly enjoyed his success, not&nbsp;least because it made his parents happy. For&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time, they had patiently watched him drift from continent to continent, dabbling in the&nbsp;performing arts. Even though they never said&nbsp;as much, they must have wondered what on earth he&nbsp;was doing with his life. After all, they were practical people with serious jobs and a Protestant work ethic. \"I&nbsp;think they were concerned, more than anything, because comedy seemed to be a very uncertain future. Then they heard me on Radio 4, and they were like, 'Oh, that seems to have a bit more substance to it.'&nbsp; \"</p><p>His mother died in 2005, but his 80-year-old father still enjoys his shows. (\"We have got a similar humour. He's into surreal, odd stuff.\") As&nbsp;does his nine-year-old son, Dax, who has already started heckling him at gigs. He says Dax is so used to seeing him introduced on stage that whenever he comes across a microphone, he feels compelled to do the honours. \"We were on holiday recently and found this karaoke bar, and he just took over. He had the mic and he was like, 'OK, we're going to take a short break and we'll be back in 10 minutes,' then he introduced me.\" Bailey says he was so taken aback that he couldn't think of anything to do but perform, so he and Dax did a duet.</p><p>Bailey met his wife in 1987 at one of his&nbsp;gigs when he was a jobbing comedian. Kristin, who is now responsible for his business affairs, was running a bar in Edinburgh. He wooed the former costume designer with a weekly letter for 12 months till she finally weakened. In 1998, they married on a whim in Banda, Indonesia. Dax is named after an Indonesian friend. The three of them share a house down the road from his office&nbsp;with four parrots, two monkeys, a python, a&nbsp;chameleon, a few fish, two starlings, a number of cats and five rescue dogs (three of which he had&nbsp;shipped over from Indonesia).</p><p>Now 49, he had to wait until he was 31 for his first sniff of success, but before long he was omnipresent – and not just as a comedian. There was Bill Bailey the actor (notably alongside Dylan Moran in the TV series <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-books\" title=\"\">Black Books</a>), the panel show fixture (pop quiz <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v0dz\" title=\"\">Never Mind The Buzzcocks</a>), the ornithologist (<a href=\"http://sky1.sky.com/bill-baileys-birdwatching-bonanza-2\" title=\"\">Bill Bailey's Birdwatching Bonanza</a>), the natural historian (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyaWpZeGYTU\" title=\"\">Baboons With Bill Bailey</a>), the music instructor (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/oct/17/comedy\" title=\"\">Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide To The Orchestra</a>). And now there's Bill Bailey the champion of forgotten heroes: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0160nxk\" title=\"\">he has just made a two-part documentary about Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, Darwin's colleague and rival, and co-originator of the theory of evolution.</p><p>Bailey loves doing the non-funny stuff. \"I was in Jakarta recently doing a talk at the Indonesian Heritage Society about Wallace … There were no laughs in it. It was just a talk about something I&nbsp;felt passionate about. There were a&nbsp;couple of nods of appreciation, that's all, and I&nbsp;felt great at the end of it. Quite satisfied.\" He loves to escape the confines of comedy, the tyranny of the laugh.</p><p>As he's talking, I find myself staring at a creepy Bill Bailey mask. \"Ah yes,\" he says with a smile. \"I&nbsp;was headlining the Saturn stage at Knebworth, and headlining the Apollo stage was <a href=\"http://www.slipknot1.com/\" title=\"\">Slipknot</a>. I&nbsp;thought, because Slipknot's trademark is scary masks, I'd have my own Slipknot mask made of myself.\" He tries it on, and he does look genuinely scary. But not for long.</p><p>I offer him a Malteser. \"But I was just about to offer you a Belgian chocolate biscuit. I'll see your Malteser and raise you a Belgian Titbit.\"</p><p>There's something heartening about Bailey's success. After all, comedy can be such a ruthless, backstabbing world. Do you have to be a show-off to get on? \"Undoubtedly. I don't think any comic could say there isn't a bit of them that doesn't want to show off. You have to have that, otherwise you can't really do it.\" Do you have to be tough? \"You have to have a thick skin, yes. If&nbsp;you're going to do something as foolhardy as standup, you've got to be able to take it on the chin if someone has a go at you.\" Is he really thick-skinned? \"Probably not. But I am resilient.\"</p><p>It's easy to imagine Bailey as a much loved university lecturer – perhaps professor of music, popular entertainment, natural history and joke-free comedy. Has he ever fancied an alternative career? \"No, because the stage allows comics a certain freedom of expression that you don't get anywhere else. You can say whatever you want – it's the last bastion of free speech in some ways. So I feel there's an obligation to make it that bit more interesting …\" He clicks his fingers impatiently, searching for his words. \"A bit more about something, a bit more challenging, for me and the audience.\"</p><p>Bailey puts on his coat on and says he's got to be off now – he's going straight to Indonesia. How's he getting there? \"The 209. Goes all the way to Jakarta!\" That sounds dangerously like a joke. He apologises, locks the door behind him and heads off down the road to south-east Asia.</p><p>• Bill Bailey's Qualmpeddler is touring from Friday until 3 November; go to <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk\" title=\"\">billbailey.co.uk</a> for details.

Here's a survival guide from one weathered veteran</p><p>The marathon coverage of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a> has set into motion the all-too-familiar. When something awful happens, the human impulse is get informed instantly. That often means rushing to a TV and gaping at the unfolding drama. It's an understandable reflex, but usually, a self-defeating one, like scratching a sore or drinking sea water.</p><p>It may satisfy the immediate urge, but beware the consequences. CNN's false report about arrests was as predictable as it was irresponsible; live TV coverage is a world of blunder. So, if you must tune into 24-hour cable news for the latest, there a few things always to bear in mind:</p><p><strong>A watched pot never boils.</strong> Following violent crimes and disasters, the intensity of the coverage is inversely correlated with the prospects for advancing the story. Incidents last as long as they last – usually, seconds – then they are over. The \"when\" and \"where\" and some of the \"who\" (victims) are immediately obvious. The rest of the \"who\" (the culprits, the missing), plus the \"why\" and the \"how\", can take days or weeks or months to unravel. </p><p><strong>The latest developments usually aren't.</strong> Desperate to add to the endlessly repeated basic facts, reporters will breathlessly pass along tiny bits of detail gleaned from authorities speaking unofficially, possible witnesses and cousins of possible witnesses. Do not be fooled by the urgency in the journalists' voices. The details are second or third hand and usually wrong. \"Unconfirmed report\" means \"not true\". \"Confirmed report\" means \"probably not true\".</p><p><strong>Get your brain a screen saver.</strong> That's what computers use to keep a single image from being etched into the screen. If a tragic news event is caught on video, TV will show you again and again what happened until it is forever burned into your consciousness. Eventually, this denudes even the most shocking footage of any informational or emotional clout – not to mention, meaning – and turns it into little more than a GIF. If you absolutely must hang on to every word, consider switching to the radio.</p><p><strong>If you knew what went on in the kitchen, you might not eat at the restaurant.</strong> The cable channels have a handful of anchors and a handful of reporters. They may look authoritative, but they don't constitute anything remotely like a robust news-gathering machine. The channels do employ a whole mess of producers, but their principal job is to book experts and pundits, who may have credentials and make-up, but are basically just guessing.</p><p><strong>Bad news does not necessarily have larger significance.</strong> When calamity erupts, your favorite network will be live on the scene for hours or days. Logos will be designed. Concern will be etched on the anchors' faces. Thoughts and prayers will be expressed for victims and their kin. But neither the amount of airtime nor even the body count are reliable measures of intrinsic importance. A fatal spasm of violence (in the west only), or a mass shooting, or even a missing blond person (if cute), will always trump, for instance, a budget vote or telecom lobbying or other events lacking yellow police tape that affect a large percentage of the population every day. As the saying goes: if it bleeds it leads. The corollary is: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission\">Citizens United</a> – the supreme court ruling that fundamentally altered the scale and transparency of US political campaign funding – didn't get a logo.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Shoot_Horses,_Don't_They%3F_(novel)\">They shoot horses, don't they?</a></strong> You've seen film of the dance marathons from the 1930s – those desperate people circling the floor for hour on end, day and night, in the hopes of winning some pitiful prize. When you tune into 24-hour cable after a tragedy, ask yourself the question: \"There is nothing being accomplished through this awful spectacle, so why am I watching?\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/ustelevision\">US television industry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bob-garfield\">Bob Garfield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Asked how he managed to hide his \"dark side\", the Daily Mail reports he said: \"It wasn't a case of hiding it. I did the same as everybody else. I was a lad; we partied a bit, but I didn't hide anything. It's just that nobody bothered to look in the right place. You have to remember that doing kids' TV then, you were expected to be the son of Enid Blyton, and that was very difficult. Now you can be much more open, and have a proper life. But then, it was almost, 'Oh, you've got a girlfriend. What type of girl is she?' But my mates and I very quickly realised: don't go into central London and have a wild time. By the way, when I say partying, my weakness has always been booze. I never got into drugs, because I wasn't very good at it.\" Monkey wonders what Schofield and Gordon the Gopher really got up to in the Broom Cupboard.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/childrens-tv\">Children's TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/celebrity\">Celebrity</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/monkey\">Monkey</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Live action this afternoon includes the women's all-around competition, with Great Britain's four-strong team due to feature senior debutantes Gabby Jupp and Charlie Fellows. Also, there are highlights of the men's all-around discipline, with several of the celebrated London 2012 Team GB squad getting set to slap chalk on their hands. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><p></p><h2>Unreported World<br />7.30pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Aidan Hartley reports from Gilgil, Kenya, a small town with a hefty population of homeless children. Many of them descended on Gilgil five years ago, after being orphaned and/or displaced by the ethnic violence that beset the country following disputed elections. Hartley meets some of the kids and falls in with the Restart Centre, one of those quietly heroic local outfits dedicated to making a bad place a bit better. Inevitably, their resources are smaller in scale than the problem they're attempting to tackle. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><p></p><h2>Ice Road Truckers<br />8pm, Channel 5<br /></h2><p>It's the season five finale of Ice Road Truckers and the ice is melting, which may mean that spring is on the way but also makes it among the most perilous times to navigate the roads of the frozen northern US and Canada. In Manitoba, Rick and Hugh are hoping to make it home in one piece for another season; but, in fairly predictable fashion, things don't quite go to plan. Meanwhile, over in Fairbanks – and following Dave's dismissal last week – the winner of the load count for the season is up for grabs. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>The Ice Cream Girls</strong><br />9pm, ITV<br /></h2><p>Dorothy Koomson's international bestseller receives a welcome three-part transition to the small screen. Under very different circumstances, two women return to the coastal resort where they grew up, 17 years on from accusations that they murdered their duplicitous ratbag schoolteacher. Poppy (Jodhi May) has spent that time in prison after being convicted, while Serena (Lorraine Burroughs) returns with the life and family built during her years of freedom, desperate to avoid her past. A captivating first act. <em>MJ</em></p><h2><strong>The Genius Of Josiah Wedgwood</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>Wedgwood, we know, made nice pottery, but this documentary by historian and author AN Wilson aims to prove that he was more than just a potter; and, tacitly, to prove that Wilson himself is more than just a plum for hire. Wilson's father worked at Wedgwood in the 1950s, and the multiplicity of Josiah's talents (artist, chemist, philanthropist) has captivated the presenter since childhood. Wilson's narrative attempts a bit too much, but Wedgwood's achievements still gleam through the clutter. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2>Oliver Stone's Untold History Of The United States<br />9pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></h2><p>With his reputation for muck-raking and provocation, Oliver Stone feels a good fit for this 10-part parallel history of the US, which, the director assures us in a rather portentous introduction, will \"tell the American story that has never been told before\". Stone begins with the second world war, arguing that the allies' eventual victory was a result of Soviet stamina rather than American interventionism. Nothing terribly radical here, but it's urgently told nonetheless. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><p></p><h2>Not Going Out<br />9.30pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>Lucy is taking a course in counselling. This, of course, is a red rag to Lee's pawing, snorting, unreconstructed bull, who soon takes up the challenge to be her guinea pig, with the ultimate aim of getting his leg over. It's an overly familiar setup and one that makes those frequent comparisons between Not Going Out and Men Behaving Badly seem justified. At any rate, it soon transpires that Lee has father issues, in the shape and size of Bobby Ball, who might well be able to shed some light on matters. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Da Vinci's Demons</strong><br />10pm, FOX<br /></h2><p>David Goyer, co-writer of the Dark Knight trilogy, is responsible for this new drama, which steals some of the commercial heat from The Da Vinci Code. Reimagining 15th-century Florence as alluringly sumptuous but fetid with intrigue, vice and murder, it stars Tom Riley as the artist, cutting an almost swashbuckling presence as he seeks to expose the lies of religion, undermine the dominance of the elite and make peace with his father. Liberties are taken with history, and the dialogue can be risibly portentous, but it's sexily watchable. <em>David Stubbs</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/davinci\">Leonardo da Vinci</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/oliver-stone\">Oliver Stone</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mark-jones\">Mark Jones</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewmueller\">Andrew Mueller</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ben-arnold\">Ben Arnold</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnrobinson\">John Robinson</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alicatterall\">Ali Catterall</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidstubbs\">David Stubbs</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gwilym-mumford\">Gwilym Mumford</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The series was never made, but from then onwards Yemi, who has died aged 82, regularly featured on radio. His talent was spotted, too, by television producers and he appeared in series including Danger Man (1965), Dixon of Dock Green (1968), The Black Safari (1972) and The Fosters (1976).</p><p>Yemi's play Parcel Post (1976) explored the clash of traditional African virtues with the values of modern Britain. It was directed by Donald Howarth at the Royal Court in London and, during the theatre's 50th birthday celebrations in 2006, Howarth recalled that the play had a \"reconditioning\" effect on audiences. Among Yemi's other stage plays were Fingers Only (1982), Waiting for Hannibal (1986), Para Ginto (1995) – Peer Gynt transposed to African soil – and A Long Way From Home (1991).</p><p>Yemi was born in Otta, Nigeria, from a line of Yoruba kings. The foundations of his love for theatre and the arts were laid at Abeokuta grammar school. In the mid-1950s Yemi travelled to the UK intending to become a journalist, but read a book on Stanislavsky and thought: \"This is it.\" Yemi joined the Actors' Workshop in 1960 and the London School of Film Technique (now the London Film School) in 1966. Later, he took a master's degree at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p><p>In 1995 Jude Kelly, as artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse, invited Yemi to join the cast of Wole Soyinka's Beatification of Area Boy as part of the Africa 95 celebration. His final stage appearance was on the Olivier stage at the National theatre in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/aug/29/theatre1\" title=\"\">Thea Sharrock's 2007 production of Emperor Jones</a>.</p><p>Yemi inspired a younger generation of Nigerian writers and artists in the UK. I first met him in 1991 at Bush House for a BBC World Service radio drama recording. He became a firm source of encouragement and in subsequent years attended every production I produced or directed. During its 10th anniversary All African Stars Gala (2008) at Theatre Royal Stratford East, the British-African theatre company Tiata Fahodzi (which I founded) recognised his contribution to British theatre.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, the actor and poet Ebony White, and their two daughters, Adenrele and Mimi; another daughter, Marigold, from a previous relationship; and three sisters, Arinade Victoria, Layo and Janet.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/radio\">Radio</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He's also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s0zz2\" title=\"Britains Youngest Top Chef \"><strong>Britain's Youngest Head Chef </strong></a>(BBC3), with a string of awards and posh work experience placements behind him. Now he's also chef patron of a restaurant in a boutique country hotel labouring&nbsp;under the name of Sanctum on the Green.</p><p>Its owner, self-styled \"rock'n'roll hotelier\" Mark Fuller, was so impressed by Luke he went into business with him without even tasting his food first. Why would he do that? \"I would be lying if I said that I didn't think it would be good for the business and a great PR angle,\" said Fuller. Ah. Luke's agent, Borra Garson, also took him on without trying the food. \"I never felt cynical about it,\" she said. Feeling cynical, it seems, was for the rest of us.</p><p>Actually, the one thing that was never in doubt in this diverting documentary was Luke's ability to cook. But there was calculation behind the narrative's trajectory: the boy has bitten off more than he can chew; the pressure is too much for him; he's only 18 after all.</p><p>The result was the sort of car crash you suspect has been engineered for the insurance. Fuller took Luke to London to try his hand at VIP catering for the Wireless festival – the bread-and-butter business that enables Fuller to maintain a nine-room boutique hotel – then complained that Luke needed to spend more time in the restaurant's kitchen.</p><p>Throughout the programme Fuller had much to say about Luke's relative immaturity, his inflated expectations, his love of publicity and his business inexperience. It was hard not to think:&nbsp;but you're the one who hired him and&nbsp;you didn't even taste the food&nbsp;first.</p><p>The only person who seemed unable to follow the script was Luke, whose self-belief never faltered. Once you got over the fact that he sounded like a kid reading a script meant for Marco Pierre White, Luke came across as driven, appealingly arrogant and right about everything.</p><p>His criticisms of the restaurant's decor were both wildly impolitic and spot on. \"I can't stand these tables,\" he said, looking at them as if they alone stood between him and his first Michelin star. \"There's a mark on the wall, there's a big cobweb up there, the bulbs are too bright, the side plates don't look right, that glass isn't polished.\"</p><p>This was ostensibly a documentary about a talented but overambitious young lad who would learn from his mistakes before he jeopardised a bright future. But I'm afraid I came away thinking that all the difficulties at Sanctum on the Green could have been overcome more quickly if everybody&nbsp;had just shut up and listened to Luke.</p><p>We have had documentaries examining the roots of the present Syrian conflict, but the most pressing question about the war is not \"How did it start?\" but \"Why isn't it over?\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-126/episode-1\" title=\"Syria: Across The Lines\"><strong>Syria: Across the Lines</strong></a> (Channel&nbsp;4) examined the deadly stalemate in microcosm. Film-maker Olly Lambert spend five dangerous weeks in the Orontes river valley, where until recently Alawites and Sunnis lived in peaceful coexistence. Now they shoot at each other across the river, while crops rot in no man's land.</p><p>Ahmad defected from the police force to the Free Syrian Army and grew a beard to mark the change. \"He's just grown it for appearances,\" said his mum. \"It's not really him.\"</p><p>At the rebel HQ in the village of Kansafra, they have a portrait of Assad on the floor, so they can step on it every time they go in or out. Across the river, the Assad&nbsp;portraits are hung on the wall, but other differences are not immediately apparent.</p><p>The front line is a long way from the political and ideological forces driving the conflict. As one rebel leader said dismissively of a totally unobserved ceasefire: \"These decisions are made by people who live abroad.\"</p><p>On the government-held side of the valley, soldiers believe the rebels have been infiltrated by foreign extremists, but rebel and Sunni are still used interchangeably – as, on the other side, are Alawite and regime. Rebels openly vowed to inflict casualties on Alawite civilians. A government soldier said, \"You either win, or you die.\"</p><p>When the bearded Ahmad was injured by bombs from fighter jets, his mother promised to drink Assad's blood. Meanwhile, people keep dying either side of the Orontes river and  there is no end in sight.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/watchthis\" title=\"\">• Watch this: TV highlights</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tvlistings.guardian.co.uk/default.aspx\" title=\"\">• Full TV listings</a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timdowling\">Tim Dowling</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In this week's event, nine teams will race around a course off the coast of Naples. The catamarans involved in this event make for more spectacular television than most sailing, but this remains a sport perhaps more involving to do than to watch. Britain is represented by the Royal Cornwall Yacht Club, captained by recently retired Olympic champion Ben Ainslie. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><p></p><h2>The British Animal Honours 2013<br />8pm, ITV<br /></h2><p>Across the nation, animals prepare their furry little disappointment faces and get ready to clap their paws bitterly, as they find out who's scooped the gongs in this live awards ceremony hosted by Paul O'Grady. Even if you love a tale of dog bravery, two hours of plaudits for animals and those who work with them is in danger of wearing a little thin. Still, if you fancy seeing who's been crowned Canine Commando, Guardian Angel and Ray Of Sunshine, prepare to have your heart well and truly melted. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Brushing Up On – British Tunnels</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Recently seen on BBC4's Goodbye Television Centre bash lambasting the suits for flogging the iconic building, Danny Baker returns for a new series less likely to cause awkward shuffling in the boardroom. Using archive footage to explore various topics, it opens with a look at some of Albion's many subterranean passageways. Promising to cover everything from the Channel tunnel to the underground domiciles fashioned by green protester Swampy, this should prove a treat for all fans of Baker's endlessly engaging verbal riffola. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2><strong>Maureen Lipman: If Memory Serves Me Right</strong><br />9pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>Actor Maureen Lipman has been contemplating memory: she doesn't think she has a particularly good one, though she relies on it for her work. More troubling is that her father lost his short-term memory, which deeply affected her, so she wants to find out more about it. This is one of those \"personal journeys\" – it features her friends and family, her worries and anxieties – but Lipman makes for an intelligent and genial host as she uncovers how memory works, from birth through to old age. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2>Could We Survive A Mega-Tsunami?<br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>The volcanic island of La Palma in the Canaries is a ticking time bomb, threatening the coasts of Europe, Africa and the US with catastrophe if it decides to explode one day. The landslip that could occur might send a kilometre-high wave travelling at several hundred miles an hour first to Africa, then to mainland Europe. Then again it might not. This one-off hour of cable channel-standard conjecture is quite beneath the BBC, but still it flounders on with \"maybes\" and \"what ifs\" regardless. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><p></p><h2><strong>Playhouse Presents: Hey Diddly Dee</strong><br />9pm, Sky Arts 1<br /></h2><p>Peter Serafinowicz, Mathew Horne and Kylie Minogue star in this comedy-drama about the cast of a new Andy Warhol musical putting up with Serafinowicz's monstrous star turn, until the theatre's mysterious cat gets involved. Actor Marc Warren writes and directs a delightful tale of the unexpected, and Serafinowicz has the time of his life swanning about in Warhol's wig. Another treat tucked away on Sky Arts. Keep an eye on them: turn your back for a second and you could miss a gem. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>A Night At The Rijksmuseum</strong><br />10pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>After running five years over schedule during its extensive renovations, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which charts 800 years of Dutch history, is finally reopening. So has the work been worth all the bother and expense? Keen to find out, Andrew Graham-Dixon goes behind the scenes at the venerable institution as the staff prepare to welcome punters again for the first time in a decade, an event that will see masterpieces by the likes Vermeer and Rembrandt going on display in sometimes radically re-engineered spaces. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2>Nashville<br />10pm, More4<br /></h2><p>\"Can you get my jet ready, please? I need to get out of here.\" Yes, it's melodrama o'clock in Nashville once again. The young missy demanding her steel horse of the sky is Juliette, the Swift-alike who's desperate to get a divorce from Sean, whom she married, like, 10 minutes ago. Grand dame of the country music craft Rayna is finding it hard to get a replacement for Deacon ready for the divas' co-headlining Red Lips, White Lies tour. Of course, there's jealousy and upstaging going on at every turn. Marvellous. <em>HV</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewmueller\">Andrew Mueller</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/hannah-verdier\">Hannah Verdier</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mark-jones\">Mark Jones</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-skegg\">Martin Skegg</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ben-arnold\">Ben Arnold</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliaraeside\">Julia Raeside</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonathanwright\">Jonathan Wright</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news. Reporting the supreme court verdict on Obama's healthcare reforms, it wrongly reported that the individual mandate part of the legislation had been struck down. The mistake was later blamed on a producer who had jumped the gun.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/boston-globe\">Boston Globe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/cnn\">CNN</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/associated-press\">Associated Press</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We even tried portraying her as a pleasant person; it did not work</p><p>When Margaret Thatcher was ousted from the leadership of the Tory party, I had a conversation with my partner Peter Fluck about our relationship with her. I pointed out that, because of the success of our <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image\" title=\"\">satirical puppet show Spitting Image</a>, we would probably be joined at the hip forever with Thatcher. \"Well,\" said Fluck, \"I'm having the operation.\"</p><p>For caricaturists, at least, Thatcher was always a good little earner. The first caricature Peter and I made of her was commissioned by the late <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/23/pressandpublishing.obituaries\" title=\"\">Hugo Young</a>, who was then a political columnist for the Sunday Times. Hugo insisted I read the Tory party&nbsp;manifesto that had ushered Thatcher into 10 Downing Street. \"C'mon,\" I said, \"it's the usual load of old bollocks.\" \"No,\" he replied. \"She is going to do it.\" And indeed she did.</p><p>In the runup to her election, Peter and I had caricatured her as a question mark for the cover of the New Statesman (Who Is This Woman?), and as a dominatrix for a skin magazine because we quickly recognised that certain members of the Tory party liked a strong woman. We made caricatures of her partnered with Johnny Rotten for a satire on nightmare couples, which also included Princess Margaret and Tony Armstrong Jones. But we had no idea at that time just how many caricatures we were going to have to make of her, or how long the woman was going to be PM, or how uncomfortably close we were going to have to follow her star. The harder we tried to undermine her policies, the more successful Spitting Image became. Peter and I had been successful at publishing three-dimensional caricatures, modelled in plasticine then photographed, for magazines worldwide, but it was with the arrival of Thatcher and Spitting Image that our work really took off.</p><p>Over the years, Spitting Image's portrayal of Thatcher developed. As she became more strident, the puppet became more manic and manly. In desperation we tried satirical irony by portraying her as a pleasant person. It did not work and was instantly dropped. I had my own views on Thatcher the person. She was a lower-middle-class petit bourgeois. I come from a similar background and understood the enemy. She was, therefore, much easier to caricature than&nbsp;the bog-standard upper-class, self-deprecating, slippery politician.</p><p>Of all the caricatures we made, my personal favourite remains an image entitled Maggalyn: Thatcher as Marilyn Monroe in that famous pose astride an up-draft trying to hold down her billowing dress giving us a glimpse of her knickers. Our version was almost a facsimile of the original photograph, except if you look closely La Thatch is <a href=\"http://agi-open.com/cache/84d27b9a0c508d424761c21924ea751bb86319c6.jpg\" title=\"\">wearing Y-fronts with a bulging package</a>.</p><p>Moving from print to television was an eye-opener. We were astonished how much outrageous stuff went to air with no problems. Spitting Image was never really leaned on; instead, it became a weekly lancing of Thatcher's excesses. Every year, Spitting Image published a comedy book for Christmas and we often tried to recycle ideas from the show to the printed page, only to be advised by our lawyers to drop the offending pages. One publisher, convinced that Thatcher would sue, wrote a note to 10 Downing Street to ask for the PM's blessing. To her credit, a letter came back wishing his entrepreneurial venture well. The most successful merchandising wheeze we came up with were the dog chews – throw a politician to your dog. They loved the colourful little squeaky rubber busts of Thatcher and Reagan.</p><p>Not all our enterprises had such happy endings. The National Portrait Gallery commissioned a Spitting Image exhibition for the summer holidays. We put forward the idea of the children entering the exhibition through Thatcher's mouth and travelling along her innards, with all her wondrous achievements and friends and enemies on display, to a small television studio where the kids who had been lucky enough to get the Willy Wonka golden tickets got to make a quick puppet show while the&nbsp;others watched, finally all exiting through the&nbsp;Iron Lady's bottom.</p><p>The workshop and I were toiling hard on going over budget when I received a call from the gallery. Some new trustees (Thatcher-appointed) objected to the exhibition. This had never happened before; trustees usually rubber-stamped exhibitions. The harassed director was profoundly sorry and upset but made it clear the show must not go on. Hugo Young explained to me that Thatcher's modus operandi was to place her people at the top of institutions and very quickly everything else would fall into line – and, of course, it worked.</p><p>Spitting Image was most certainly joined at the&nbsp;hip with Thatcher. We strung it out for far too&nbsp;long after she went, but the steam had gone out of the show. We had a great deal of&nbsp;fun with the Leaderene. Clearly my idea of fun would not have been Thatcher's. Seeing in the New Year with Jimmy Savile, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2306481/Margaret-Thatcher-dead-CNN-run-PM-JIMMY-SAVILE-picture-tribute-blunder.html\" title=\"\">as she did on a number of occasions</a>, would have been my idea of hell. And that was before we discovered that you had to hide the grandchildren. Thatcher's lack of humour and abrasive and confrontational approach to carrying out her&nbsp;policies made the downright rudeness of&nbsp;Spitting Image possible. The current blitzkrieg of eulogies to the Thatcher years is driven by a nostalgia without memory.</p><p></p><p><em>Suzanne Moore is away.</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy\">Comedy</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Recently used to record episodes of Not Going Out, Mock The Week and Miranda; it has also been home to Dad's Army, Only Fools and Horses, Blackadder and Little Britain. However, redevelopment plans could see it demolished, following the recent sale of Television Centre to development company, Stanhope plc.</p><p>The closure is predicted to cause a chronic shortage of studio space in the capital. An <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/tc8/signatures\" title=\"\">online petition to save TC8 already has more than 650 supporters</a>, including actor Colin Baker, who recorded episodes of Doctor Who there in the mid-80s.</p><p>Currently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/31/bbc-television-centre-virtual-experience?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">only three of Television Centre's eight studios are planned to remain in use from 2015 following refurbishment</a>.</p><p>Lighting director Martin Kempton, who's worked in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tellyspotting/sets/72157625299586630/detail/\" title=\"\">TC8</a> on sitcoms such as Yes, Prime Minister and Miranda, says: \"Most television programmes that use studios on a daily and nightly basis use studios that are 90ft by 70ft … [The BBC] used to have four studios that size and by losing three of them, that's put huge pressure on the industry.\"</p><p>\"There isn't enough studio capacity as it is,\" says Not Going Out director Nick Wood. \"We're all scratching our heads over what we're going to do – where we're going to go … It only takes a couple of productions to pencil in the studios and then the third production won't have anywhere to go.\"</p><p>\"The autumn is always the busiest period,\" explains Kempton. \"It starts off around September and then goes right through to Christmas … You walk round Television Centre and all of the studios are heaving – fully-booked everywhere you go. So, there will be a problem. Programmes will have to be cancelled … We don't know for sure whether there'll be another series of Not Going Out … but if there is … I don't know where that would go.\"</p><p>This autumn, with the whole of Television Centre closed for refurbishment, BBC Studios and Post Production will only be hiring out a small number of studio spaces in premises at Elstree. However, these stages cannot be \"turned around\" as quickly as those at Television Centre, meaning less programmes recorded over the course of one week. Campaigners argue that saving TC8 could help alleviate the pressure.</p><p>\"There's no reason to knock [TC8] down,\" says Wood. \"It's not in the way of the new development. It's just such a silly thing to do.\"</p><p>\"All the power and the ventilation system, is all separate,\" explains Kempton. \"It certainly would be possible to keep it … at one end [of the development].\"</p><p>In a statement, Anna Mallett, chief executive of BBC Studios and Post Production, says that she is: \"Looking forward to continuing to offer HD studios at Elstree and Bristol whilst Television Centre is being redeveloped and returning to the site in 2015 to operate three studios … to serve television production in the south-east.\"</p><p>Also in 2015, BBC Worldwide will take up residence in another part of Television Centre, previously occupied by BBC News. However, a question mark still hangs over the future of TC8.</p><p>\"Everyone's so angry,\" concludes Kempton. \"They're not upset in a nostalgic sense … People are just really, really angry that studios that are as well-equipped [are to close]. They are easily the best equipped studios in the country.\" The TV Centre site's developer, Stanhope plc, has declined to comment on TC8's future, but is expected to publish further detailed planning proposals this month.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/comedy\">Comedy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy\">Comedy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediabusiness\">Media business</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Time to talk about the route, tell us about the undertakers and the horses – six black chargers led by Mr Twister – who'll pull the gun carriage after a pit stop at St Clement Danes.</p><p>And there are distinguished guests, mostly titled, in the studio overlooking St Paul's. Shirley Williams is generous, remembers the Iron Lady actually ironing, and praises her extraordinary single-mindedness and seriousness.</p><p>\"What brings you here?\" Dimbleby asks Terry Wogan. Sir T's not sure, he didn't know Lady T well, but he tells a story about her, Denis and a couple of gin and tonics I've heard before. Peter Hennessy, the historian, is on hand for pithiness. \"She was a primary-colours politician who disturbed all the atoms in politics,\" he says.</p><p>Over on ITV … Oh: Jeremy Kyle. They're starting later. Back to One then, and Dimbleby's spotting faces in the crowd. Betty Boothroyd, Leon Brittan, Ken Clarke coming up the stairs, Nigel Lawson, Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger.</p><p>ITV have realised something's up. They start their coverage, anchored by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, who was aged minus two when Thatcher came to power. OK, they have ITN newsreader Alastair Stewart at St Paul's, but they're dipping in and out, going back to the studio to hear what Toby Young thinks, or to talk to Chris Evans.</p><p>The BBC it is then: you want a Dimbleby for an occasion like this, don't you? He's got the PM with him now. \"I don't like to talk about opinion polls on a day like this,\" he tells Cameron, before going on to do just that, specifically one that shows the Tory rating surging by eight points when people were asked to imagine it was led by a youthful Maggie. Dimbleby's not neglecting his job, then, as a political journalist, even on a day like this.</p><p>He has a good funeral. The BBC cameras may have missed the Ludgate Circus protesters, but he does at least mention them. The coverage is fair, neither fawning nor aggressively disrespectful.</p><p>Once the service begins there's not an awful lot to do apart from introduce a few more people. There's one minor Fumbleby: \"One of Lady Thatcher's favourite films\" turns out to be one of her favourite hymns (sadly: for a moment I thought a screen would be lowered from the dome and they'd show Top Gun to the assembled dignitaries). And surely only the very, very puerile would have have been amused by, or even noticed, \"Roger Gifford takes her [the Queen] up the nave.\"</p><p>Afterwards, there's just time for a bit more sleb-spotting – Norman Lamont, another Shirley (Bassey), Jeremy Clarkson (\"I think he's very sympathetic to her politically\"). The coffin is handed over to Leverton & Sons, family undertakers (founded 1789, the year of the start of the French Revolution, as it happens). And the lady inside is, as Hennessy says, handed over to the historians.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/itv1\">ITV channel</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/david-dimbleby\">David Dimbleby</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samwollaston\">Sam Wollaston</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This ecumenical attitude was not entirely artistic: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/11/hitchcock-the-girl-truth-master-suspense\" title=\"\">as depicted in the recent film Hitchcock</a>, about the making of the horror movie, the director had financial problems caused by having, due to studio scepticism, to part-fund the<br />film himself. But Hitchcock, as a populist and a self-advertiser (he had long made cameo appearances in his movies), was also drawn to the possibility that the younger art form offered of bringing his work and himself to simultaneous audiences of millions.</p><p>In appearing as a presenter and host, Oliver Stone is directly following Hitchcock, although his participation in Untold History is only vocal, consisting of almost hour-long monologues on voice-over. But, in common with his cinematic near-contemporary, Martin Scorsese, Stone has seen TV as an opportunity for documentary rather than fiction.</p><p>Before his current factual project, the director of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/61568/nixon\" title=\"\">Nixon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77907/jfk\" title=\"\">JFK</a> had presented <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388574/\" title=\"\">America Undercover</a>, a show devoted to exposé documentaries, while the director of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36313/taxi.driver\" title=\"\">Taxi Driver</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/37702/goodfellas\" title=\"\">Goodfellas</a> has regularly contributed small-screen documentaries, usually on the subject of music, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_%28film%29\" title=\"\">The Blues</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_in_the_Material_World\" title=\"\">Living in the Material World</a>. True, Scorsese directed the opening episode of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/boardwalk-empire\" title=\"\">Boardwalk Empire</a> but he withdrew to the production side afterwards.</p><p>But the movie director who has done most to suggest an artistic equality between TV and cinema is David Lynch. His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/21/twin-peaks-twenty-years-on\" title=\"\">Twin Peaks</a> (ABC, 1990-91) challenged two powerful beliefs: that TV drama was most suited to realism - Lynch worked within a police procedural structure but introduced weirdness and surrealism – and that good directors only worked in television as an apprenticeship for Hollywood. Twin Peaks significantly reduced cinematic snobbery against broadcasting, not least because its picture-house spin-off – Lynch's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/82658/twin.peaks.-.fire.walk.with.me\" title=\"\">Twin Peaks: Come Fire Walk With Me</a> (1992) – was a flop, while the first series of the TV drama, in which Agent Cooper investigates the disappearance of Laura Palmer, remains a recognised classic which had huge influence in freeing TV drama from the tyranny of linear narrative. Eventually, Lynch himself proved too far ahead of executive taste with his next intended TV project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/90677/mulholland.drive\" title=\"\">Mulholland Drive</a>, which was rejected when the network saw pilot material and Lynch was forced to turn it into a feature film.</p><p>It may be significant that Lynch is also an artist: a profession in which there is less of a hierarchy between different sizes and styles of art: the movie theatre and the living room were simply different canvases to him. In the cases of two other directors with substantial credits in both sizes of image, there was also a strong element of gratitude. Steven Spielberg and Anthony Minghella had both begun in television, the former learning his craft on episodes of Marcus Welby MD and Columbo, while the latter was script editor on Phil Redmond's children's show Grange Hill and wrote for Inspector Morse before making his debut as a writer-director with Truly Madly Deeply, made by the BBC as a cinema-TV hybrid.</p><p>Partly as a result of these CVs – and also because they belonged to the first generation to grow up with TV as a standard part of life - neither directed ever succumbed to the disdain for the goggle-box that is common in Hollywood. Both returned there even after winning Oscars, attracted by the greater space that TV offers for storytelling. Poignantly, Minghella's final directing work, screened after his death in 2008, was on the BBC1 Sunday night drama <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00j7zmj\" title=\"\">The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency</a>. Spielberg's work for the medium includes the impressive war epics <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/band-of-brothers/index.html\" title=\"\">Band of Brothers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/the-pacific/index.html\" title=\"\">The Pacific</a>, although he has risked lowering the value of his name in TV credits with looser executive-producer attachments to trash such as <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/smash/\" title=\"\">Smash</a>.</p><p>So, while some movie purists may regard Bates Motel as a vulgarisation of a classic film, it follows a model of cross-pollination established by Hitchcock and which sensible directors, including Spielberg and Stone, now follow.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/oliver-stone\">Oliver Stone</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/anthonyminghella\">Anthony Minghella</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/alfredhitchcock\">Alfred Hitchcock</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/martinscorsese\">Martin Scorsese</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/davidlynch\">David Lynch</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/stevenspielberg\">Steven Spielberg</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marklawson\">Mark Lawson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Using the same fixed-rig setup that the channel loves to return to again and again, The Fried Chicken Shop took a week's worth of footage from Clapham's Roosters Spot eatery and distilled it into a tightly packed hour of entertainment. And it was much more fun than it had any right to be.</p><p></p><p>This week, Channel 4 announced that The Fried Chicken Shop is to return for three episodes that will repeat and expand on the premise of the original. We will still see the Roosters Spot staff grind out one impossibly long shift after another. We will still see Clapham's finest slumped over the counter at chucking-out time, manfully attempting to order a Mega Mix chicken burger with their last remaining molecule of dignity intact. But this time, we are promised, we will also get to follow some of the takeaway customers home. This new addition will almost certainly contain the most exciting footage of a lonely man sitting on a carpet in a bedsit and silently eating chips at 2am that British television has ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The beauty of The Fried Chicken Shop is its universality. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/24-hours-in-ae\" title=\"\">24 Hours in A&E</a> and feel admiration for the medical staff and their ability to maintain composure under extraordinary pressure. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-hotel\" title=\"\">The Hotel</a> and wonder why any of the guests agreed to let cameras into their rooms. But to watch The Fried Chicken Shop is to recognise a part of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Plenty of us, at one point or another, have bought fast food while drunk. Many of us will have done so without a second thought for the staff behind the counter. What The Fried Chicken Shop did so well was to make it clear how awful we probably are when we do this.  Judging by the show, the staff of Roosters Spot have put up with it all: aggressive drunks; attention-seeking drunks; people pretending to be disabled; drug dealers handing out business cards; and social media hipster dullards, who function as an argument for sawing a circle around the edge of London and letting it drop into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Watching the staff remain as good-natured and professional as they were in the face of such soul-sapping arsery was a joy. It was as heartwarming as anything else I have seen on television this year. And although it had the potential to lapse into the uncomfortably sneery classism that Channel 4's Gypsy programmes sometimes revel in, The Fried Chicken Shop staunchly refused to judge anyone. It didn't have a point to make, or an issue to force home, other than the awkward \"Wow, don't people eat a lot of chicken these days?\" message tacked on to the start. It was happy enough just to show us the chicken shop and let us reach our own conclusions. The first episode was magnificent. I can't wait to hang out there again.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fast-food\">Fast food</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food & drink</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuart-heritage\">Stuart Heritage</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This new addition will almost certainly contain the most exciting footage of a lonely man sitting on a carpet in a bedsit and silently eating chips at 2am that British television has ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The beauty of The Fried Chicken Shop is its universality. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/24-hours-in-ae\" title=\"\">24 Hours in A&E</a> and feel admiration for the medical staff and their ability to maintain composure under extraordinary pressure. You might watch <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-hotel\" title=\"\">The Hotel</a> and wonder why any of the guests agreed to let cameras into their rooms. But to watch The Fried Chicken Shop is to recognise a part of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Plenty of us, at one point or another, have bought fast food while drunk. Many of us will have done so without a second thought for the staff behind the counter. What The Fried Chicken Shop did so well was to make it clear how awful we probably are when we do this.  Judging by the show, the staff of Roosters Spot have put up with it all: aggressive drunks; attention-seeking drunks; people pretending to be disabled; drug dealers handing out business cards; and social media hipster dullards, who function as an argument for sawing a circle around the edge of London and letting it drop into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Watching the staff remain as good-natured and professional as they were in the face of such soul-sapping arsery was a joy. It was as heartwarming as anything else I have seen on television this year. And although it had the potential to lapse into the uncomfortably sneery classism that Channel 4's Gypsy programmes sometimes revel in, The Fried Chicken Shop staunchly refused to judge anyone. It didn't have a point to make, or an issue to force home, other than the awkward \"Wow, don't people eat a lot of chicken these days?\" message tacked on to the start. It was happy enough just to show us the chicken shop and let us reach our own conclusions. The first episode was magnificent. I can't wait to hang out there again.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fast-food\">Fast food</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food & drink</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuart-heritage\">Stuart Heritage</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now the brothers are about to appear on TV together again</p><p>An enduring tale of sibling harmony, Gary and Martin Kemp have spent decades working companionably alongside one another without ever, publicly at least, succumbing to fraternal combustion. The arts, and particularly pop music, is&nbsp;littered with brothers (more so, curiously, than sisters) who have tried to do the same and failed, among them Ray and Dave Davies of the Kinks and Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis, each undone by ego and the need to dominate. But the Kemps are different, an anomaly. Now&nbsp;both in their 50s, they remain essentially one and the same, and consequently stronger together than the sum of their parts.</p><p>But how? Gary Kemp, who, at 53, is two years Martin's senior, thinks that it is down to their upbringing. \"There were only four of us in our family: my mum, my dad, me, him. They were devoted to us, and we were devoted to&nbsp;them. It was them that gave us our sense of responsibility to one another, our moral compass. We've never lost it.\"</p><p>Initially, they were both child actors, often being cast alongside one another. Then, in the late 70s, they formed Spandau Ballet, new romantic goliaths with an unusual sense of fashion and a gift for mainstream balladry. The band ultimately split acrimoniously, but the Kemp brothers' partnership remained intact and, in 1990, they revived their first love, acting, playing Reg and Ronnie Kray in The Krays. They have dabbled in music and acting ever since, sometimes apart, more frequently in&nbsp;tandem.</p><p>This month, they return to the small screen, fronting the documentary Gangs of Britain, in which they explore British gang culture past and present. As ever, they make a good team, but do they never get sick of working with each other? Do they not crave a little autonomy?</p><p>Gary smiles. \"Not really, no, because we get on, we complement each other. Also, we're different people, with different personalities. What Martin does, I would never attempt, and vice versa, I think.\"</p><p>Is this true? To the viewing public at least, this is less clear. Surely casting directors could request either of them?</p><p>Gary remains insistent. \"No really, we are completely different. I'm more hyper, he is more laidback. I'm a control freak, I've always lusted for cultural things. Martin is more physical, more charismatic.\"</p><p>\"Charisma always was the important thing to me,\" Martin says. \"I joined Spandau Ballet not because I wanted to be the best musician in the world, but because I wanted to be Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando.\"</p><p>\"Sexual attraction,\" Gary suggests.</p><p>Martin chuckles. \"Yes,\" he says. \"I&nbsp;wanted that.\"</p><p>When I meet the Kemps in their PR offices, both look immaculate: suited and booted, hair swept back, their jawlines, up close, improbably strong. Gary is, indeed, the more hyper, the more effusive, while Martin has clearly learned plenty from watching Brando. Sitting in a large armchair that seems too small for him, and interlocking his fingers, he doesn't say much, but instead broods with a quiet intensity.</p><p>They were born and brought up in Islington, north London. Their father was a printer, their mother a seamstress, and they were latchkey children who joined a drama club for want of anything better to do after school. But in the 60s, the local Anna Scher children's theatre drama club was to British television what the Brit School is to today's pop charts: a conveyor belt of readymade talent. They were soon appearing in children's TV programmes and small films. At 16, Gary, a Bowie obsessive, started a band, and when they required a new bassist, he asked Martin not because Martin had any musical prowess – he hadn't – but because \"he was the coolest guy we knew, always popular with the girls. If anyone was going to get us magazine front covers, it was him.\"</p><p>Alongside Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet dominated the early 80s with their flash swagger, but success was tempered by boiling backroom rivalries. \"Me and Martin would fight occasionally, sure,\" Gary says, \"but no&nbsp;one could ever take sides because it&nbsp;would blow over in no time. If I argued with Tony [Hadley, the lead singer], on the other hand, it would be a disaster. It could have gone on for weeks – for ever.\"</p><p>\"It did,\" says Martin, laughing.</p><p>Band harmony ruptured, seemingly irrevocably, in the late 80s, but when the band finally split in 1990, the Kemps landed on their feet. That same&nbsp;year, the film The Krays established their acting careers, though neither achieved as much big-screen success in its wake as they had hoped. In the mid-90s, Gary decamped to Los Angeles to give Hollywood a go. Martin soon followed. \"We were going up for the same auditions a lot of the time, obviously,\" Martin says, \"but we understood that; there was no getting around it.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, they did try, by having separate agents. \"But,\" says Gary, \"sometimes Martin would get a script I&nbsp;hadn't been sent, and it was difficult not to phone my agent and say, 'Hey, he's got it, why haven't I?'\"</p><p></p><p>Both returned to the UK, and in 1998 Martin landed a major role in EastEnders. I ask how Gary felt about this and he tells me I'm forgetting something. Three years earlier, Martin had been diagnosed with a brain tumour – two, in fact. \"It was a terrible time. I felt awful for him, and so guilty. I was the older brother, and here he was with this terrible disease, not me. So when he got better and landed EastEnders, all I felt was pride and relief.\"</p><p>\"That was the main reason I took the part,\" Martin says. \"I'd had three years of illness. I needed to change that, to leave that part of my life behind.\"</p><p>In January 2009, illness tested them again when they lost both parents within four days of one another. \"An absolute disaster,\" Gary says. Their mother had been sick, and was in hospital for a heart operation. The family visited her one day, but by the time they got home, their father was behaving strangely. Complaining of a whooshing in his ear, he said he needed the toilet. \"He was in there a long time. I called out to him, and he said: 'I'm all right, boy.' But his voice sounded strange.\"</p><p>He had had a massive heart attack. Moments later, Gary was in the bathroom giving his father the kiss of life. He died a few days later. Telling their mother was the hardest thing he has ever had to do. \"She simply didn't want to live. She gave up.\"</p><p>But in this decision, he says, there was a kind of solace, peace, even. \"Our parents had never spent a day apart. They were so devoted, so old-fashioned, really. With him gone, she was lost. She looked around her and said: 'All is fine.' What she meant was, my wife was about to have a baby, Spandau were getting back together again after 19 years, and she was confident that both me and Martin were happy. So she was right, everything was fine, and she could go. Two days later, she was gone. We had a joint funeral.\"</p><p>Today, Gary lives in central London with his second wife. He has four sons. Martin and his wife live in Herefordshire with one daughter and one son. Their families socialise a lot, and the brothers will continue to work together. They would like to do more documentaries, and are in discussion to co-direct a film.

Now the brothers are about to appear on TV together again</p><p>An enduring tale of sibling harmony, Gary and Martin Kemp have spent decades working companionably alongside one another without ever, publicly at least, succumbing to fraternal combustion. The arts, and particularly pop music, is&nbsp;littered with brothers (more so, curiously, than sisters) who have tried to do the same and failed, among them Ray and Dave Davies of the Kinks and Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis, each undone by ego and the need to dominate. But the Kemps are different, an anomaly. Now&nbsp;both in their 50s, they remain essentially one and the same, and consequently stronger together than the sum of their parts.</p><p>But how? Gary Kemp, who, at 53, is two years Martin's senior, thinks that it is down to their upbringing. \"There were only four of us in our family: my mum, my dad, me, him. They were devoted to us, and we were devoted to&nbsp;them. It was them that gave us our sense of responsibility to one another, our moral compass. We've never lost it.\"</p><p>Initially, they were both child actors, often being cast alongside one another. Then, in the late 70s, they formed Spandau Ballet, new romantic goliaths with an unusual sense of fashion and a gift for mainstream balladry. The band ultimately split acrimoniously, but the Kemp brothers' partnership remained intact and, in 1990, they revived their first love, acting, playing Reg and Ronnie Kray in The Krays. They have dabbled in music and acting ever since, sometimes apart, more frequently in&nbsp;tandem.</p><p>This month, they return to the small screen, fronting the documentary Gangs of Britain, in which they explore British gang culture past and present. As ever, they make a good team, but do they never get sick of working with each other? Do they not crave a little autonomy?</p><p>Gary smiles. \"Not really, no, because we get on, we complement each other. Also, we're different people, with different personalities. What Martin does, I would never attempt, and vice versa, I think.\"</p><p>Is this true? To the viewing public at least, this is less clear. Surely casting directors could request either of them?</p><p>Gary remains insistent. \"No really, we are completely different. I'm more hyper, he is more laidback. I'm a control freak, I've always lusted for cultural things. Martin is more physical, more charismatic.\"</p><p>\"Charisma always was the important thing to me,\" Martin says. \"I joined Spandau Ballet not because I wanted to be the best musician in the world, but because I wanted to be Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando.\"</p><p>\"Sexual attraction,\" Gary suggests.</p><p>Martin chuckles. \"Yes,\" he says. \"I&nbsp;wanted that.\"</p><p>When I meet the Kemps in their PR offices, both look immaculate: suited and booted, hair swept back, their jawlines, up close, improbably strong. Gary is, indeed, the more hyper, the more effusive, while Martin has clearly learned plenty from watching Brando. Sitting in a large armchair that seems too small for him, and interlocking his fingers, he doesn't say much, but instead broods with a quiet intensity.</p><p>They were born and brought up in Islington, north London. Their father was a printer, their mother a seamstress, and they were latchkey children who joined a drama club for want of anything better to do after school. But in the 60s, the local Anna Scher children's theatre drama club was to British television what the Brit School is to today's pop charts: a conveyor belt of readymade talent. They were soon appearing in children's TV programmes and small films. At 16, Gary, a Bowie obsessive, started a band, and when they required a new bassist, he asked Martin not because Martin had any musical prowess – he hadn't – but because \"he was the coolest guy we knew, always popular with the girls. If anyone was going to get us magazine front covers, it was him.\"</p><p>Alongside Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet dominated the early 80s with their flash swagger, but success was tempered by boiling backroom rivalries. \"Me and Martin would fight occasionally, sure,\" Gary says, \"but no&nbsp;one could ever take sides because it&nbsp;would blow over in no time. If I argued with Tony [Hadley, the lead singer], on the other hand, it would be a disaster. It could have gone on for weeks – for ever.\"</p><p>\"It did,\" says Martin, laughing.</p><p>Band harmony ruptured, seemingly irrevocably, in the late 80s, but when the band finally split in 1990, the Kemps landed on their feet. That same&nbsp;year, the film The Krays established their acting careers, though neither achieved as much big-screen success in its wake as they had hoped. In the mid-90s, Gary decamped to Los Angeles to give Hollywood a go. Martin soon followed. \"We were going up for the same auditions a lot of the time, obviously,\" Martin says, \"but we understood that; there was no getting around it.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, they did try, by having separate agents. \"But,\" says Gary, \"sometimes Martin would get a script I&nbsp;hadn't been sent, and it was difficult not to phone my agent and say, 'Hey, he's got it, why haven't I?'\"</p><p></p><p>Both returned to the UK, and in 1998 Martin landed a major role in EastEnders. I ask how Gary felt about this and he tells me I'm forgetting something. Three years earlier, Martin had been diagnosed with a brain tumour – two, in fact. \"It was a terrible time. I felt awful for him, and so guilty. I was the older brother, and here he was with this terrible disease, not me. So when he got better and landed EastEnders, all I felt was pride and relief.\"</p><p>\"That was the main reason I took the part,\" Martin says. \"I'd had three years of illness. I needed to change that, to leave that part of my life behind.\"</p><p>In January 2009, illness tested them again when they lost both parents within four days of one another. \"An absolute disaster,\" Gary says. Their mother had been sick, and was in hospital for a heart operation. The family visited her one day, but by the time they got home, their father was behaving strangely. Complaining of a whooshing in his ear, he said he needed the toilet. \"He was in there a long time. I called out to him, and he said: 'I'm all right, boy.' But his voice sounded strange.\"</p><p>He had had a massive heart attack. Moments later, Gary was in the bathroom giving his father the kiss of life. He died a few days later. Telling their mother was the hardest thing he has ever had to do. \"She simply didn't want to live. She gave up.\"</p><p>But in this decision, he says, there was a kind of solace, peace, even. \"Our parents had never spent a day apart. They were so devoted, so old-fashioned, really. With him gone, she was lost. She looked around her and said: 'All is fine.' What she meant was, my wife was about to have a baby, Spandau were getting back together again after 19 years, and she was confident that both me and Martin were happy. So she was right, everything was fine, and she could go. Two days later, she was gone. We had a joint funeral.\"</p><p>Today, Gary lives in central London with his second wife. He has four sons. Martin and his wife live in Herefordshire with one daughter and one son. Their families socialise a lot, and the brothers will continue to work together. They would like to do more documentaries, and are in discussion to co-direct a film. The union has been fruitful so far, why stop now?</p><p>\"Mum and Dad were fantastic parents, and they instilled a lot of pride in us, a lot of love,\" says Gary. Martin nods solemnly. \"We've taken a lot from them, I think,\" he says. \"Me and Gary, the way we are – it's all down to them.\"</p><p></p><p><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/gangs-of-britain.html\" title=\"\"><em>Gangs of Britain</em></a><em> begins on the Crime & Investigation Network, Sky Channel 553 at 9pm on 21 April</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock\">Pop and rock</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/drama\">Drama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/soap-opera\">Soap opera</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nick-duerden\">Nick Duerden</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When somebody tells him one, he says, he feels as if he's being mugged – the buildup, the promise that he'll find this one funny, the forced reaction. Ugh. Nothing worse.</p><p>Bailey is possibly the world's least likely rock'n'roll comedian. It's not just the aversion to old-fashioned one-liners; it's the way he tells his non-jokes (cerebral shaggy dog stories that don't always conclude with much of a laugh) and his appearance (shoulder-length half-head of hair and mad, staring eyes, like something out of the Hobbit). But rock'n'roll comedian he is. He sells out stadiums, does world tours, has his share of obsessive fans and struts the stage with guitar in hand. He has a thing for progressive rock, and in a way his epic tours are like classic 1970s concept albums. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/nov/10/bill-bailey-review\" title=\"\">Dandelion Mind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/jan/07/bill-bailey-gielgud-review\" title=\"\">Tinselworm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2004/nov/07/comedy\" title=\"\">Part Troll</a>, Cosmic Jam: even the names of the shows evoke prog rock. In his latest, <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk/tour/\" title=\"\">Qualmpeddler</a>, he confronts his myriad doubts about the modern world via religious dubstep, folk bouzouki,  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a>, rare planetary alignment, Spice Girl reunions and more.</p><p>We meet at his Hammersmith office, which is every bit as bonkers as you might hope. Every object tells an unlikely story. There's the vintage clarinet-reed vending machine picked up in Philadelphia; a load of french horns that he bought as a job lot and turned into wall lights; a massive Bill Bailey Toblerone bar propped up on a grand piano (the manufacturer gave him mountains of the stuff for a piece he was doing about hoarding for the apocalypse); and a huge, terrifying bird.</p><p>What is that owl thing, I ask.</p><p>\"That 'owl thing' is a Eurasian eagle owl.\" It's stuffed, but looks pretty lively at first glance. \"It's a gift from my wife, because we rescued one from a Chinese restaurant last year.\" Where? \"In China. So it's a reminder of that.\"</p><p>How did he rescue an owl from a Chinese restaurant? \"We bought it. It was on the menu. It&nbsp;was a live owl, in a cage, on the menu waiting to be eaten, and we haggled with them for a bit and bought it for $400. We put it in a taxi, drove up to the woods, and let him go. I talk about it in the new show. Our son was with us at the time. He was eight then, and he filmed it on his little camera. There's this very sweet film I show at the end of the standup show, of us releasing this owl. The camera's a bit jiggly, then you see the owl emerge out of this carboard box, and then it flies off.\"</p><p>The stuffed owl in the office is massive. \"Yes,\" Bailey says. \"It is. It's the largest. My wife Kristin is a collector of oddities like this.\" Are you sure this isn't the owl that was on the menu? He grins. \"It may be! I&nbsp;am quite tempted to bring it out at the end of the show and say, 'We changed our minds! We were going to release it, but we thought no, fuck it, it looks much nicer in the office.' \"</p><p>This being Bailey, he's not quite finished yet. There's a bit more knowledge to impart. \"The Eurasian eagle owl is an apex predator, so you can release them anywhere in the world and they would be fine. An apex predator means that nothing preys on it.\" There follows a quick class on apex predators, humans, jaguars and the South American jungles.</p><p>He has an astonishing ability to soak up obscure knowledge and incorporate it into his act. As a boy, he says, his mind was a sponge. He grew up in Bath as Mark Bailey – he was nicknamed Bill by his music teacher, becase he played the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET1X96SyWMI\" title=\"\">Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey</a> so beautifully on his guitar. He was an only child, to a doctor father and nurse mother, and spent much of his time chatting with adults, mining them for knowledge. He sees his own son, also an only child, doing the same thing now. He'd tell tall stories, and often wonder how he'd dreamed them. \"You spend a lot more time on your own as an only child. And there's space to allow your imagination to take flight. If&nbsp;you're bouncing ideas off someone, you take it one way and they take it another, wherereas if it's just you, there are no constraints.\"</p><p>Was he ridiculously clever? \"I won't lie to you,\" he says. \"At school I found it easy. Every year I got the prize.\" Was it a posh school? \"Not particularly – it was direct grant. All boys. And every year for the first three years they said, 'OK, the English prize is Bailey', then geography, history, maths, physics, everything. One year I won them all.\"</p><p>His fellow pupils must have despised him. \"They did. 'Ah, you bloody swot.'\" It gets worse,&nbsp;Bailey says. He&nbsp;wasn't simply brilliant academically – he was great at everything. \"One year I was captain of the cricket team, and the lead in the school play. Fair play to the English teacher who decided on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui\" title=\"\">The Resistible Rise Of Arturo Ui</a> – good on yer.\" Bailey's never been backwards at coming forwards: even today, his promotional material stresses that he's not simply messing about with comedy music – he's pitch-perfect.</p><p>Did he hate himself for being good at everything? \"I sort of did. I rebelled against it, and by the fourth and fifth year I just went off the rails.\" He stopped trying, stopped winning prizes, and joined a band. Going off the rails is all relative, though – he still managed to get an A in his English A-level. He started studying for an English degree, but gave up after a year. \"I was restless. I&nbsp;wanted to get on, be challenged a bit more. I suppose there is a natural sense of rebellion somewhere along the line. At school, I&nbsp;was bored with the teachers, and there were moments where I felt they were singling me out… I suppose because they thought, 'Oh, here's a student we can get great results with', and I&nbsp;resolutely refused to go along with it. The same at university. I just got bored with it.\"</p><p>For a decade or so, he drifted, travelling across&nbsp;the globe in search of the meaning of life (spending lots of time in Indonesia, where he's off to later this afternoon), following any hippyish trail he came across, but also working – touring with a theatre company, playing in bands, doing comedy.</p><p>Back then, he even told jokes. Lots of them: short and punchy, the ones he can't stand. He was part of a double act, working at the <a href=\"http://www.jokerclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Joker Comedy Club in Southend</a>. One night in 1994 the owner rang to tell him the closing act had dropped out and asked if Bailey could do an emergency shift.</p><p>\"But my partner Martin was on holiday. He said, 'Can't you just do it on your own?' I&nbsp;went, 'I&nbsp;don't know if I can', and he said, 'Well, here's the money', and I went, 'Oh, I get the same money if it's just me! I'll do it.\"</p><p>He did the gig, and it was disastrous. \"The Joker is quite raucous: they like their comedy and they let you know one way or the other. Then some bloke said, 'Oi, mate, tell us a joke!' I&nbsp;thought, 'Oh my God, I can't think of any jokes at all.' So I went, 'OK, three blokes went into a pub', and straight away there was attention because this was something the audience could respond to.\"</p><p>The problem was, there wasn't a joke at the end of it. He&nbsp;didn't have a clue what he would say next.</p><p>\"I'm thinking, 'I'm so in the shit here.' So I said, 'I say three – it was probably more like four or five', and that got a couple of laughs. Then I said, 'Well, I say five – it was 10. OK, 10 blokes go in a pub', and I&nbsp;say, 'OK, there were quite a few more than that – 20-30 blokes', and then it was 100, 200, a village, a small town, an area of Holland, northern Europe, and it went on and on, extrapolating this thing from three to most sentient blokes. 'OK, the entire male population of the world goes into a pub and the first bloke goes up to the bar, and says, I'll get these.' And I&nbsp;said, 'What an idiot!' And it got a huge laugh, and I&nbsp;thought: that just came out of nowhere.\"</p><p>It was a revelation. Bailey realised that was what he actually enjoyed – deconstructing humour. And if he could get a laugh in the process, so much the better. \"What I'd been doing up till then was not really what I'd been wanting to do. It was like a facsimile of a comedy act: it was what we'd seen other people do. It was jokes and one-liners and songs, but it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I'd settled for it.\"</p><p>He thought if he'd managed to dismantle a&nbsp;joke&nbsp;in front of such a tough, beery crowd, he&nbsp;could develop this. So he went on to tell jokes&nbsp;set&nbsp;in the 1950s, in Shakespearean and Chaucerian times, about all sorts of unlikely subjects – and the skill of these anti-jokes lay in the telling rather than in the punchline, which often didn't exist anyway.</p><p>What happened to poor Martin? \"Well, he came back from holiday, and we did some more gigs, and then I said, 'I want to do this on my own now', and he said, 'Yeah, all right, fine.' We parted amicably. He went on to work for a photo archivist, which suited him down to the ground, because he was obsessed with cataloguing.\"</p><p>So Bailey had become an accidental surrealist. And after a long wait, his career took off quickly. In 1995, he won a Time Out comedy award; the next year he was shortlisted for the Perrier at Edinburgh. His act was more wordy than Proust, his humour was clever and gentle, most of his non-jokes were accompanied by music, and he appealed to people who liked to think of themselves as being on the smart side. He was also virtually impossible to categorise. I&nbsp;ask if he can explain his humour. And he's stumped.</p><p>\"Well …\" He takes a deep breath. \"It's a mixture of different elements: straightforward standup, observational, a bit of politics, a bit of philosophical discourse, a bit of interaction with the audience where I try to subvert the nature of&nbsp;audience participation. Then there are various musical sections of the show, where the music is&nbsp;observational, so it's not a parody per se: the music is the joke. So, for example, I bemoan the&nbsp;fact that the church has lost its influence in&nbsp;society – the church was always a big part of my childhood; now people don't take it seriously. The church has lost touch with the youth, they need to try to re-engage, so I&nbsp;imagine writing a piece to promote the church using dubstep, so we have an organ section, which turns into dubstep, which turns into an animated film in which the Archbishop of Canterbury turns into a ball of hair, which kills the devil with lightning... Hahahaha!\" He's laughing not at the sketch, but at the impossibility of explaining it. \"I can see your problem.\"</p><p>Has he ever tried to break it down like this before? \"No! No! I'm trying to draw the elements together.\" Cognitive dissonance apparently comes into it somewhere – \"something we all experience, but we maybe don't know we do\".</p><p>Now I'm having to ask him for an explanation of his explanation. What's cognitive dissonance? \"It's when there are two opposing thoughts in your head which seem to cancel each other out, yet you're able to hold them simultaneously. Smoking is a classsic one.

Kristin, who is now responsible for his business affairs, was running a bar in Edinburgh. He wooed the former costume designer with a weekly letter for 12 months till she finally weakened. In 1998, they married on a whim in Banda, Indonesia. Dax is named after an Indonesian friend. The three of them share a house down the road from his office&nbsp;with four parrots, two monkeys, a python, a&nbsp;chameleon, a few fish, two starlings, a number of cats and five rescue dogs (three of which he had&nbsp;shipped over from Indonesia).</p><p>Now 49, he had to wait until he was 31 for his first sniff of success, but before long he was omnipresent – and not just as a comedian.

But not for long.</p><p>I offer him a Malteser. \"But I was just about to offer you a Belgian chocolate biscuit. I'll see your Malteser and raise you a Belgian Titbit.\"</p><p>There's something heartening about Bailey's success. After all, comedy can be such a ruthless, backstabbing world. Do you have to be a show-off to get on? \"Undoubtedly. I don't think any comic could say there isn't a bit of them that doesn't want to show off. You have to have that, otherwise you can't really do it.\" Do you have to be tough? \"You have to have a thick skin, yes. If&nbsp;you're going to do something as foolhardy as standup, you've got to be able to take it on the chin if someone has a go at you.\" Is he really thick-skinned? \"Probably not. But I am resilient.\"</p><p>It's easy to imagine Bailey as a much loved university lecturer – perhaps professor of music, popular entertainment, natural history and joke-free comedy. Has he ever fancied an alternative career? \"No, because the stage allows comics a certain freedom of expression that you don't get anywhere else. You can say whatever you want – it's the last bastion of free speech in some ways. So I feel there's an obligation to make it that bit more interesting …\" He clicks his fingers impatiently, searching for his words. \"A bit more about something, a bit more challenging, for me and the audience.\"</p><p>Bailey puts on his coat on and says he's got to be off now – he's going straight to Indonesia. How's he getting there? \"The 209. Goes all the way to Jakarta!\" That sounds dangerously like a joke. He apologises, locks the door behind him and heads off down the road to south-east Asia.</p><p>• Bill Bailey's Qualmpeddler is touring from Friday until 3 November; go to <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk\" title=\"\">billbailey.co.uk</a> for details.

When somebody tells him one, he says, he feels as if he's being mugged – the buildup, the promise that he'll find this one funny, the forced reaction. Ugh. Nothing worse.</p><p>Bailey is possibly the world's least likely rock'n'roll comedian. It's not just the aversion to old-fashioned one-liners; it's the way he tells his non-jokes (cerebral shaggy dog stories that don't always conclude with much of a laugh) and his appearance (shoulder-length half-head of hair and mad, staring eyes, like something out of the Hobbit). But rock'n'roll comedian he is. He sells out stadiums, does world tours, has his share of obsessive fans and struts the stage with guitar in hand. He has a thing for progressive rock, and in a way his epic tours are like classic 1970s concept albums. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/nov/10/bill-bailey-review\" title=\"\">Dandelion Mind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/jan/07/bill-bailey-gielgud-review\" title=\"\">Tinselworm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2004/nov/07/comedy\" title=\"\">Part Troll</a>, Cosmic Jam: even the names of the shows evoke prog rock. In his latest, <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk/tour/\" title=\"\">Qualmpeddler</a>, he confronts his myriad doubts about the modern world via religious dubstep, folk bouzouki,  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a>, rare planetary alignment, Spice Girl reunions and more.</p><p>We meet at his Hammersmith office, which is every bit as bonkers as you might hope. Every object tells an unlikely story. There's the vintage clarinet-reed vending machine picked up in Philadelphia; a load of french horns that he bought as a job lot and turned into wall lights; a massive Bill Bailey Toblerone bar propped up on a grand piano (the manufacturer gave him mountains of the stuff for a piece he was doing about hoarding for the apocalypse); and a huge, terrifying bird.</p><p>What is that owl thing, I ask.</p><p>\"That 'owl thing' is a Eurasian eagle owl.\" It's stuffed, but looks pretty lively at first glance. \"It's a gift from my wife, because we rescued one from a Chinese restaurant last year.\" Where? \"In China. So it's a reminder of that.\"</p><p>How did he rescue an owl from a Chinese restaurant? \"We bought it. It was on the menu. It&nbsp;was a live owl, in a cage, on the menu waiting to be eaten, and we haggled with them for a bit and bought it for $400. We put it in a taxi, drove up to the woods, and let him go. I talk about it in the new show. Our son was with us at the time. He was eight then, and he filmed it on his little camera. There's this very sweet film I show at the end of the standup show, of us releasing this owl. The camera's a bit jiggly, then you see the owl emerge out of this carboard box, and then it flies off.\"</p><p>The stuffed owl in the office is massive. \"Yes,\" Bailey says. \"It is. It's the largest. My wife Kristin is a collector of oddities like this.\" Are you sure this isn't the owl that was on the menu? He grins. \"It may be! I&nbsp;am quite tempted to bring it out at the end of the show and say, 'We changed our minds! We were going to release it, but we thought no, fuck it, it looks much nicer in the office.' \"</p><p>This being Bailey, he's not quite finished yet. There's a bit more knowledge to impart. \"The Eurasian eagle owl is an apex predator, so you can release them anywhere in the world and they would be fine. An apex predator means that nothing preys on it.\" There follows a quick class on apex predators, humans, jaguars and the South American jungles.</p><p>He has an astonishing ability to soak up obscure knowledge and incorporate it into his act. As a boy, he says, his mind was a sponge. He grew up in Bath as Mark Bailey – he was nicknamed Bill by his music teacher, becase he played the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET1X96SyWMI\" title=\"\">Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey</a> so beautifully on his guitar. He was an only child, to a doctor father and nurse mother, and spent much of his time chatting with adults, mining them for knowledge. He sees his own son, also an only child, doing the same thing now. He'd tell tall stories, and often wonder how he'd dreamed them. \"You spend a lot more time on your own as an only child. And there's space to allow your imagination to take flight. If&nbsp;you're bouncing ideas off someone, you take it one way and they take it another, wherereas if it's just you, there are no constraints.\"</p><p>Was he ridiculously clever? \"I won't lie to you,\" he says. \"At school I found it easy. Every year I got the prize.\" Was it a posh school? \"Not particularly – it was direct grant. All boys. And every year for the first three years they said, 'OK, the English prize is Bailey', then geography, history, maths, physics, everything. One year I won them all.\"</p><p>His fellow pupils must have despised him. \"They did. 'Ah, you bloody swot.'\" It gets worse,&nbsp;Bailey says. He&nbsp;wasn't simply brilliant academically – he was great at everything. \"One year I was captain of the cricket team, and the lead in the school play. Fair play to the English teacher who decided on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui\" title=\"\">The Resistible Rise Of Arturo Ui</a> – good on yer.\" Bailey's never been backwards at coming forwards: even today, his promotional material stresses that he's not simply messing about with comedy music – he's pitch-perfect.</p><p>Did he hate himself for being good at everything? \"I sort of did. I rebelled against it, and by the fourth and fifth year I just went off the rails.\" He stopped trying, stopped winning prizes, and joined a band. Going off the rails is all relative, though – he still managed to get an A in his English A-level. He started studying for an English degree, but gave up after a year. \"I was restless. I&nbsp;wanted to get on, be challenged a bit more. I suppose there is a natural sense of rebellion somewhere along the line. At school, I&nbsp;was bored with the teachers, and there were moments where I felt they were singling me out… I suppose because they thought, 'Oh, here's a student we can get great results with', and I&nbsp;resolutely refused to go along with it. The same at university. I just got bored with it.\"</p><p>For a decade or so, he drifted, travelling across&nbsp;the globe in search of the meaning of life (spending lots of time in Indonesia, where he's off to later this afternoon), following any hippyish trail he came across, but also working – touring with a theatre company, playing in bands, doing comedy.</p><p>Back then, he even told jokes. Lots of them: short and punchy, the ones he can't stand. He was part of a double act, working at the <a href=\"http://www.jokerclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Joker Comedy Club in Southend</a>. One night in 1994 the owner rang to tell him the closing act had dropped out and asked if Bailey could do an emergency shift.</p><p>\"But my partner Martin was on holiday. He said, 'Can't you just do it on your own?' I&nbsp;went, 'I&nbsp;don't know if I can', and he said, 'Well, here's the money', and I went, 'Oh, I get the same money if it's just me! I'll do it.\"</p><p>He did the gig, and it was disastrous. \"The Joker is quite raucous: they like their comedy and they let you know one way or the other. Then some bloke said, 'Oi, mate, tell us a joke!' I&nbsp;thought, 'Oh my God, I can't think of any jokes at all.' So I went, 'OK, three blokes went into a pub', and straight away there was attention because this was something the audience could respond to.\"</p><p>The problem was, there wasn't a joke at the end of it. He&nbsp;didn't have a clue what he would say next.</p><p>\"I'm thinking, 'I'm so in the shit here.' So I said, 'I say three – it was probably more like four or five', and that got a couple of laughs. Then I said, 'Well, I say five – it was 10. OK, 10 blokes go in a pub', and I&nbsp;say, 'OK, there were quite a few more than that – 20-30 blokes', and then it was 100, 200, a village, a small town, an area of Holland, northern Europe, and it went on and on, extrapolating this thing from three to most sentient blokes. 'OK, the entire male population of the world goes into a pub and the first bloke goes up to the bar, and says, I'll get these.' And I&nbsp;said, 'What an idiot!' And it got a huge laugh, and I&nbsp;thought: that just came out of nowhere.\"</p><p>It was a revelation. Bailey realised that was what he actually enjoyed – deconstructing humour. And if he could get a laugh in the process, so much the better. \"What I'd been doing up till then was not really what I'd been wanting to do. It was like a facsimile of a comedy act: it was what we'd seen other people do. It was jokes and one-liners and songs, but it wasn't really what I wanted to do. I'd settled for it.\"</p><p>He thought if he'd managed to dismantle a&nbsp;joke&nbsp;in front of such a tough, beery crowd, he&nbsp;could develop this. So he went on to tell jokes&nbsp;set&nbsp;in the 1950s, in Shakespearean and Chaucerian times, about all sorts of unlikely subjects – and the skill of these anti-jokes lay in the telling rather than in the punchline, which often didn't exist anyway.</p><p>What happened to poor Martin? \"Well, he came back from holiday, and we did some more gigs, and then I said, 'I want to do this on my own now', and he said, 'Yeah, all right, fine.' We parted amicably. He went on to work for a photo archivist, which suited him down to the ground, because he was obsessed with cataloguing.\"</p><p>So Bailey had become an accidental surrealist. And after a long wait, his career took off quickly. In 1995, he won a Time Out comedy award; the next year he was shortlisted for the Perrier at Edinburgh. His act was more wordy than Proust, his humour was clever and gentle, most of his non-jokes were accompanied by music, and he appealed to people who liked to think of themselves as being on the smart side. He was also virtually impossible to categorise. I&nbsp;ask if he can explain his humour. And he's stumped.</p><p>\"Well …\" He takes a deep breath. \"It's a mixture of different elements: straightforward standup, observational, a bit of politics, a bit of philosophical discourse, a bit of interaction with the audience where I try to subvert the nature of&nbsp;audience participation. Then there are various musical sections of the show, where the music is&nbsp;observational, so it's not a parody per se: the music is the joke. So, for example, I bemoan the&nbsp;fact that the church has lost its influence in&nbsp;society – the church was always a big part of my childhood; now people don't take it seriously. The church has lost touch with the youth, they need to try to re-engage, so I&nbsp;imagine writing a piece to promote the church using dubstep, so we have an organ section, which turns into dubstep, which turns into an animated film in which the Archbishop of Canterbury turns into a ball of hair, which kills the devil with lightning... Hahahaha!\" He's laughing not at the sketch, but at the impossibility of explaining it. \"I can see your problem.\"</p><p>Has he ever tried to break it down like this before? \"No! No! I'm trying to draw the elements together.\" Cognitive dissonance apparently comes into it somewhere – \"something we all experience, but we maybe don't know we do\".</p><p>Now I'm having to ask him for an explanation of his explanation. What's cognitive dissonance? \"It's when there are two opposing thoughts in your head which seem to cancel each other out, yet you're able to hold them simultaneously. Smoking is a classsic one. 'This is bad for me; I&nbsp;like smoking.' You recognise the dissonance in those two thoughts. So I say to the audience, 'You all know what this is', and they think they don't, but they do. <em>That's</em> what I&nbsp;like to do,\" he says with a click of his fingers, as if he's just got it. \"I get people to realise that they know all these things.\"</p><p>Because he's so mellow most of the time, it's easy to forget that Bailey is a political comedian – or at least a comedian with politics. Once, when he was asked what he thought about Tony Blair, he found himself on the front pages. \"I&nbsp;just came out with some involuntary eruption.

But I am resilient.\"</p><p>It's easy to imagine Bailey as a much loved university lecturer – perhaps professor of music, popular entertainment, natural history and joke-free comedy. Has he ever fancied an alternative career? \"No, because the stage allows comics a certain freedom of expression that you don't get anywhere else. You can say whatever you want – it's the last bastion of free speech in some ways. So I feel there's an obligation to make it that bit more interesting …\" He clicks his fingers impatiently, searching for his words. \"A bit more about something, a bit more challenging, for me and the audience.\"</p><p>Bailey puts on his coat on and says he's got to be off now – he's going straight to Indonesia. How's he getting there? \"The 209. Goes all the way to Jakarta!\" That sounds dangerously like a joke. He apologises, locks the door behind him and heads off down the road to south-east Asia.</p><p>• Bill Bailey's Qualmpeddler is touring from Friday until 3 November; go to <a href=\"http://www.billbailey.co.uk\" title=\"\">billbailey.co.uk</a> for details.

But perhaps his most enduring work is his masterclass, The Animator's Survival Kit</p><p>When the animator Richard Williams celebrated his 80th birthday last month he was the subject of widespread and heartfelt acclaim as one of the most important and influential figures in his industry. His career has ranged from tiny TV commercials to the biggest budget Hollywood features, including the 1988 homage to the golden age of animation,<em> Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, a film widely credited with single-handedly reinvigorating an art form that had fallen badly out of fashion.</p><p>Looking back over his many triumphs – as well as some notable disasters – Williams himself ascribes much of his success to a decision he made in the late 1960s, when he effectively demoted himself within his own, highly profitable and multi-award-winning, company. At that time, on the other side of the Atlantic, some of the great animators of the 1930s and 40s were beginning to retire. And as Disney and Warner Bros dispensed with their services, Williams began to hire them. Over the next few decades he would be both boss and assistant to the likes of Milt Kahl, creator of Shere Kahn, the tiger in Disney's <em>Jungle Book</em>; Art Babbitt of Goofy fame; and Grim Natwick, who animated most of <em>Snow White</em> as well as creating Betty Boop.</p><p>His first hire was Ken Harris – Bugs Bunny et al – \"arguably the best of the lot\", says Williams. \"He was Chuck Jones's top man and you could somehow spot a Ken Harris scene. He just drew slightly funnier than anyone else.\" Appropriately, their first meeting began with a laugh. \"The doors of the elevator opened and as he stepped out I just couldn't help myself,\" says Williams. \"'Yeah, yeah', Harris said, 'I look like the Coyote.' And he did. Chuck Jones had modelled it on him.\"</p><p>Over the next few decades Williams and his dream teams of animators were&nbsp;involved in some of the most distinctive and successful work of the&nbsp;period. Their 1972 version of <em>A Christmas Carol </em>won an Oscar and a TV special, <em>Ziggy's Gift</em>, picked up an Emmy. In Hollywood Williams provided the opening sequences to the <em>Pink Panther</em> movies as well as <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, which resulted in&nbsp;him being awarded another two Academy Awards.</p><p>But perhaps it is two other projects that will ultimately best define their relationship; one that succeeded and&nbsp;one that failed. The failure was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thief_and_the_Cobbler\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Thief and the Cobbler</em></a>, a feature length animation inspired by the Sufi folk tales that obsessed Williams throughout his career. From the mid 60s he had channelled vast amounts of&nbsp;time and money, as well as the expertise of his collaborators, into realising his ambition of producing the best animated film ever made. After many false dawns he was eventually removed from his own project by his backers in the early 90s. But out of this devastating wreckage emerged an unexpected triumph.</p><p>Williams collected together all that&nbsp;he had learned over the years and&nbsp;hosted a series of animation masterclasses that eventually led to the 2001 publication of <a href=\"http://www.theanimatorssurvivalkit.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Animator's Survival Kit</em></a>, a book that become the definitive teaching aid for a new generation of both students and practitioners. Five years ago the book&nbsp;was reworked into a&nbsp;set of DVDs&nbsp;and this month it is launched as&nbsp;an iPad app.</p><p>\"The DVDs were an obvious development to show movement,\" he&nbsp;explains. \"But an app is really made for it. We've included new films, we've been able to break down the lessons differently, and just being able to manipulate the drawings backwards and forward to see exactly how you get&nbsp;from here to there is quite a thing. This will be a tool for people to study animation, and also something they can actually use at their desk.\"</p><p>Although Williams's reverence for&nbsp;the classic craft skills of the early animators is at the heart of his work, he&nbsp;has long been seen as the link between the golden age of hand-drawn animation and the digital present. It was a connection recognised in one of&nbsp;his early masterclasses when 12 animators from Pixar unexpectedly enrolled. \"They'd just finished making <em>Toy Story</em>, although it hadn't yet been released, so no one was yet aware of the impact it would have. I knew it was the first computer generated feature film and so I felt obliged to tell them that I knew nothing about computers. They said that wasn't why they'd enrolled, and at the end of the course they said that 90% of what I talked about applied to them. Sometimes it looks as if everything has changed, when in fact not that much has changed at all.\"</p><p>Williams was born in Canada in 1933 and brought up in Toronto. His mother was an illustrator, who had herself once been offered a job at Disney. \"She&nbsp;took me to see <em>Snow White</em> when I&nbsp;was five and said that I was never the same again. Not that I was scared like all the other children who thought the creatures were real,\" he says. \"I knew they were drawings, and that's what fascinated me.\" Aged 14, Williams actually visited the Disney studios and&nbsp;met Walt, \"which you'd think would be a clear memory, but I only have the vaguest recollection\".</p><p>After his Disney experience he threw himself into art, which led him, for a time, away from animation. \"In&nbsp;a&nbsp;gallery I saw a room full of Rembrandts, burst into tears and said 'screw animation, this was the real thing'.\" After art school he travelled to Spain where he set himself up as artist. \"It was so cheap to live that I could survive for a year by selling just one painting. But I didn't really want to do portraits for industrialists wives. And although I had persuaded myself that the trouble with animation was that you can't get good drawings into it, I really wanted to try, and the animation sort of snuck up on me. I found myself doing these tiny little storyboard things and thinking about this idea for a film about three idealists.\"</p><p>In the mid 1950s Williams moved to&nbsp;London to work on what would become his Bafta winning <em>The Little Island</em>, which he funded by working for newly launched commercial television companies. \"When the Mr Magoo people came over to make some ads I started with them as a paint mixer, within six months I was animating and within another six months I was directing. And that's been my life ever since, doing the commercial work so as to buy time in which I could try to stretch the medium with my own work.\"</p><p>He describes <em>The Little Island</em> as \"a half hour philosophical discussion, and&nbsp;very much a young man's film. It&nbsp;took me three and half years to make and early on I went to see <em>Bambi</em> and thought, what a load of saccharine nonsense. I went to see it again as I was&nbsp;finishing <em>The Little Island</em> and came out on my hands and knees. As has happened so many times since, I realised I didn't know beans. How did they ever do that? The answer was that Milt Kahl, and all those other great people, were working on it.\"</p><p>When Williams first visited Hollywood he says he was far more intimidated by the back room animators than he was when encountering film stars. \"They did have a loyalty to one another, but also&nbsp;a real toughness. Peter Ustinov was once asked about working at Disney and the first thing he remembered was 'all those old guys tearing each other apart'.\"</p><p>Williams said he had been working with Ken Harris for seven years before Harris told him, \"maybe you could be an animator\". \"By this time I was well over 40, had the leading studio in Europe and had won over a hundred international awards. It wasn't until I was nearly 50 that he said I could be a <em>good</em> animator. But he was right in that you never know what you don't know. And that's why working with these guys was so beneficial. Art Babbitt was a natural teacher. I had so much money coming in from commercials that we closed the studio for a month and he just gave class after class. It was tremendously exciting as he was giving us all the cliches they had worked out in the 30s. It was a strange way to run a company, and it was even sillier that I invited the competition to sit in on these classes, but in the end it did produce something of a blossoming of&nbsp;English animation.\"</p><p>Perhaps the culmination of this approach was the success of <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>. Williams says he had two&nbsp;thoughts when he stood on the podium holding his brace of Oscars. \"One was about my mother. She was a&nbsp;really good animator, so I sort of did&nbsp;her career for her. My other thought was, 'now I'll get the money&nbsp;for '<em>The Thief</em>'.\"</p><p>Money was raised, but it was never enough, and when Williams was eventually removed from the project the rights were owned by different people in different parts of the world and versions of it were completed using other animators. Williams has declined to see them. \"I'm not interested, but my son, who is also an animator, did tell me that if I ever want to jump off a&nbsp;bridge then I should take a look.\"</p><p>The failure was a huge personal and professional blow to Williams, who retreated to an island off Vancouver with his wife, Mo. \"I did get a couple of&nbsp;really good offers from Hollywood, but I thought if I couldn't get <em>The Thief</em> through, which had real commercial power as well as being something I'd always wanted to make, there was no&nbsp;point. And when you've suffered defeat like that you need to get off the battlefield.\" It was in Vancouver that he began his masterclasses. He and Mo later moved back to the UK where they worked together on the book, the DVDs and now the app. They live in Bristol and have an office in the Aardman studios, where the Wallace and Gromit films are made. It is where Williams has planted his animator's sloping desk from the Disney studios – \"Walt bought a lot of them when the money started to come in after <em>Snow White</em>, and they still work\" – and where he is currently engaging with both his past and his future.</p><p>He and Mo are taking advantage of technical advances to digitally restore his archives. He is also working on a new \"big film\" (\"the subtitle is: 'will I&nbsp;live to finish it'\"). He says he is in excellent health despite a heart bypass operation a few years ago. As a thank you to his medical team, he animated some graffiti by Banksy – another Bristol artist – for his doctors to show at a medical conference. In it Banksy's masked rioter suffers a heart attack while throwing a bunch of flowers, \"and my doctors said it was the most authentic heart attack they had seen. But I should also say that he gets better by the end of the cartoon.\"</p><p>An early beneficiary of the restoration programme is a film of circus performers, which Williams began when he was just 20, later put to&nbsp;music composed by a young Richard Rodney Bennett. \"The great thing about digital is that it can open up the work in completely new ways, not least in terms of distribution. A long time ago I was asked by one of the great guys at Disney how I could survive without a Disney helping me. They knew that what they did would not have been possible without him, and it's true that I never did have a Disney and it's also true that I got screwed. If I did things again I would be wiser, but you get wise too late. I was so interested in the work that it blinded me to what was going on.

But perhaps his most enduring work is his masterclass, The Animator's Survival Kit</p><p>When the animator Richard Williams celebrated his 80th birthday last month he was the subject of widespread and heartfelt acclaim as one of the most important and influential figures in his industry. His career has ranged from tiny TV commercials to the biggest budget Hollywood features, including the 1988 homage to the golden age of animation,<em> Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, a film widely credited with single-handedly reinvigorating an art form that had fallen badly out of fashion.</p><p>Looking back over his many triumphs – as well as some notable disasters – Williams himself ascribes much of his success to a decision he made in the late 1960s, when he effectively demoted himself within his own, highly profitable and multi-award-winning, company. At that time, on the other side of the Atlantic, some of the great animators of the 1930s and 40s were beginning to retire. And as Disney and Warner Bros dispensed with their services, Williams began to hire them. Over the next few decades he would be both boss and assistant to the likes of Milt Kahl, creator of Shere Kahn, the tiger in Disney's <em>Jungle Book</em>; Art Babbitt of Goofy fame; and Grim Natwick, who animated most of <em>Snow White</em> as well as creating Betty Boop.</p><p>His first hire was Ken Harris – Bugs Bunny et al – \"arguably the best of the lot\", says Williams. \"He was Chuck Jones's top man and you could somehow spot a Ken Harris scene. He just drew slightly funnier than anyone else.\" Appropriately, their first meeting began with a laugh. \"The doors of the elevator opened and as he stepped out I just couldn't help myself,\" says Williams. \"'Yeah, yeah', Harris said, 'I look like the Coyote.' And he did. Chuck Jones had modelled it on him.\"</p><p>Over the next few decades Williams and his dream teams of animators were&nbsp;involved in some of the most distinctive and successful work of the&nbsp;period. Their 1972 version of <em>A Christmas Carol </em>won an Oscar and a TV special, <em>Ziggy's Gift</em>, picked up an Emmy. In Hollywood Williams provided the opening sequences to the <em>Pink Panther</em> movies as well as <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>, which resulted in&nbsp;him being awarded another two Academy Awards.</p><p>But perhaps it is two other projects that will ultimately best define their relationship; one that succeeded and&nbsp;one that failed. The failure was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thief_and_the_Cobbler\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Thief and the Cobbler</em></a>, a feature length animation inspired by the Sufi folk tales that obsessed Williams throughout his career. From the mid 60s he had channelled vast amounts of&nbsp;time and money, as well as the expertise of his collaborators, into realising his ambition of producing the best animated film ever made. After many false dawns he was eventually removed from his own project by his backers in the early 90s. But out of this devastating wreckage emerged an unexpected triumph.</p><p>Williams collected together all that&nbsp;he had learned over the years and&nbsp;hosted a series of animation masterclasses that eventually led to the 2001 publication of <a href=\"http://www.theanimatorssurvivalkit.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Animator's Survival Kit</em></a>, a book that become the definitive teaching aid for a new generation of both students and practitioners. Five years ago the book&nbsp;was reworked into a&nbsp;set of DVDs&nbsp;and this month it is launched as&nbsp;an iPad app.</p><p>\"The DVDs were an obvious development to show movement,\" he&nbsp;explains. \"But an app is really made for it. We've included new films, we've been able to break down the lessons differently, and just being able to manipulate the drawings backwards and forward to see exactly how you get&nbsp;from here to there is quite a thing. This will be a tool for people to study animation, and also something they can actually use at their desk.\"</p><p>Although Williams's reverence for&nbsp;the classic craft skills of the early animators is at the heart of his work, he&nbsp;has long been seen as the link between the golden age of hand-drawn animation and the digital present. It was a connection recognised in one of&nbsp;his early masterclasses when 12 animators from Pixar unexpectedly enrolled. \"They'd just finished making <em>Toy Story</em>, although it hadn't yet been released, so no one was yet aware of the impact it would have. I knew it was the first computer generated feature film and so I felt obliged to tell them that I knew nothing about computers. They said that wasn't why they'd enrolled, and at the end of the course they said that 90% of what I talked about applied to them. Sometimes it looks as if everything has changed, when in fact not that much has changed at all.\"</p><p>Williams was born in Canada in 1933 and brought up in Toronto. His mother was an illustrator, who had herself once been offered a job at Disney. \"She&nbsp;took me to see <em>Snow White</em> when I&nbsp;was five and said that I was never the same again. Not that I was scared like all the other children who thought the creatures were real,\" he says. \"I knew they were drawings, and that's what fascinated me.\" Aged 14, Williams actually visited the Disney studios and&nbsp;met Walt, \"which you'd think would be a clear memory, but I only have the vaguest recollection\".</p><p>After his Disney experience he threw himself into art, which led him, for a time, away from animation. \"In&nbsp;a&nbsp;gallery I saw a room full of Rembrandts, burst into tears and said 'screw animation, this was the real thing'.\" After art school he travelled to Spain where he set himself up as artist. \"It was so cheap to live that I could survive for a year by selling just one painting. But I didn't really want to do portraits for industrialists wives. And although I had persuaded myself that the trouble with animation was that you can't get good drawings into it, I really wanted to try, and the animation sort of snuck up on me. I found myself doing these tiny little storyboard things and thinking about this idea for a film about three idealists.\"</p><p>In the mid 1950s Williams moved to&nbsp;London to work on what would become his Bafta winning <em>The Little Island</em>, which he funded by working for newly launched commercial television companies. \"When the Mr Magoo people came over to make some ads I started with them as a paint mixer, within six months I was animating and within another six months I was directing. And that's been my life ever since, doing the commercial work so as to buy time in which I could try to stretch the medium with my own work.\"</p><p>He describes <em>The Little Island</em> as \"a half hour philosophical discussion, and&nbsp;very much a young man's film. It&nbsp;took me three and half years to make and early on I went to see <em>Bambi</em> and thought, what a load of saccharine nonsense. I went to see it again as I was&nbsp;finishing <em>The Little Island</em> and came out on my hands and knees. As has happened so many times since, I realised I didn't know beans. How did they ever do that? The answer was that Milt Kahl, and all those other great people, were working on it.\"</p><p>When Williams first visited Hollywood he says he was far more intimidated by the back room animators than he was when encountering film stars. \"They did have a loyalty to one another, but also&nbsp;a real toughness. Peter Ustinov was once asked about working at Disney and the first thing he remembered was 'all those old guys tearing each other apart'.\"</p><p>Williams said he had been working with Ken Harris for seven years before Harris told him, \"maybe you could be an animator\". \"By this time I was well over 40, had the leading studio in Europe and had won over a hundred international awards. It wasn't until I was nearly 50 that he said I could be a <em>good</em> animator. But he was right in that you never know what you don't know. And that's why working with these guys was so beneficial. Art Babbitt was a natural teacher. I had so much money coming in from commercials that we closed the studio for a month and he just gave class after class. It was tremendously exciting as he was giving us all the cliches they had worked out in the 30s. It was a strange way to run a company, and it was even sillier that I invited the competition to sit in on these classes, but in the end it did produce something of a blossoming of&nbsp;English animation.\"</p><p>Perhaps the culmination of this approach was the success of <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>. Williams says he had two&nbsp;thoughts when he stood on the podium holding his brace of Oscars. \"One was about my mother. She was a&nbsp;really good animator, so I sort of did&nbsp;her career for her. My other thought was, 'now I'll get the money&nbsp;for '<em>The Thief</em>'.\"</p><p>Money was raised, but it was never enough, and when Williams was eventually removed from the project the rights were owned by different people in different parts of the world and versions of it were completed using other animators. Williams has declined to see them. \"I'm not interested, but my son, who is also an animator, did tell me that if I ever want to jump off a&nbsp;bridge then I should take a look.\"</p><p>The failure was a huge personal and professional blow to Williams, who retreated to an island off Vancouver with his wife, Mo. \"I did get a couple of&nbsp;really good offers from Hollywood, but I thought if I couldn't get <em>The Thief</em> through, which had real commercial power as well as being something I'd always wanted to make, there was no&nbsp;point. And when you've suffered defeat like that you need to get off the battlefield.\" It was in Vancouver that he began his masterclasses. He and Mo later moved back to the UK where they worked together on the book, the DVDs and now the app. They live in Bristol and have an office in the Aardman studios, where the Wallace and Gromit films are made. It is where Williams has planted his animator's sloping desk from the Disney studios – \"Walt bought a lot of them when the money started to come in after <em>Snow White</em>, and they still work\" – and where he is currently engaging with both his past and his future.</p><p>He and Mo are taking advantage of technical advances to digitally restore his archives. He is also working on a new \"big film\" (\"the subtitle is: 'will I&nbsp;live to finish it'\"). He says he is in excellent health despite a heart bypass operation a few years ago. As a thank you to his medical team, he animated some graffiti by Banksy – another Bristol artist – for his doctors to show at a medical conference. In it Banksy's masked rioter suffers a heart attack while throwing a bunch of flowers, \"and my doctors said it was the most authentic heart attack they had seen. But I should also say that he gets better by the end of the cartoon.\"</p><p>An early beneficiary of the restoration programme is a film of circus performers, which Williams began when he was just 20, later put to&nbsp;music composed by a young Richard Rodney Bennett. \"The great thing about digital is that it can open up the work in completely new ways, not least in terms of distribution. A long time ago I was asked by one of the great guys at Disney how I could survive without a Disney helping me. They knew that what they did would not have been possible without him, and it's true that I never did have a Disney and it's also true that I got screwed. If I did things again I would be wiser, but you get wise too late. I was so interested in the work that it blinded me to what was going on. And the work is just so damn fascinating you feel as if nothing else matters.\"</p><p>He is reluctant to say too much about what \"the big film\" is about – \"we had so much publicity about <em>The&nbsp;Thief</em> and then it went wrong\" – but says it is being made in chapters – \"so if I do drop dead we will still have something\" – and that a six minute prologue, which will be a short film in its own right, will soon be ready. \"What I'm interested in is that nobody has been able to handle realism. It's just been embarrassing. So I'm doing graphic realism, these things are obviously drawings, but it will go into&nbsp;adult territory and will combine different styles. I want something that&nbsp;will be grim, but also funny and salacious and sexy. I can't tell you how excited I am by it. No one has been able to do this and I know that I can.

What's gone wrong? And how can it be put it right? We asked experts and fans to come up with an instant rescue plan</p><h2><strong>Kirstie Allsopp, TV presenter, also designs a homeware range for M&S</strong></h2><p>I'm very proud to have a range in Marks & Spencer, although I think I can be honest about what I feel. I used to buy a&nbsp;lot of clothing from M&S – I've always been a fan, and I adored their Autograph range [famous fashion designers were brought in to collaborate on collections]. There are fashion designers whose stuff I wouldn't buy at the top end, but who did a diffusion line for Autograph when it first&nbsp;started, and I have some pieces from that range that I still wear. But M&S doesn't have that any more.</p><p>When I talk to the girls at work – many of them in their mid- to late-20s and on low incomes – they tell me they shop at Primark. I don't see them buying anything from Marks & Spencer. It has become about the food, which out-cools and out-sexes the clothes. Something, somewhere got a little bit lost.</p><p>I trust Marks & Spencer, but I don't have the sense any more that I will make a real discovery. My fashion advice mainly comes from weekend newspaper supplements, and I don't see a lot of M&S stuff in them. I know they do makeup, shoes, accessories – but I can't&nbsp;remember the last time I saw something in a magazine and thought, \"ooh\", and then saw it was from M&S.</p><p>M&S can get its position back. The staff have a great attitude, and the company as a whole is a good one. I just think its womenswear has lost its edge.</p><h2><strong>Jess Cartner-Morley,  Guardian fashion editor</strong></h2><p>There is one straightforward factor contributing to M&S's woes. There is no one manning the tiller, fashionably speaking. The current collections fall between two reigns: they were conceived after Kate&nbsp;Bostock left last year, but have not been steered by her replacement, Belinda Earl – her influence will not be&nbsp;seen until the first autumn ranges land at the end of this summer. I have observed the dynamics at M&S for some time, and it strikes me that a healthy relationship between the CEO and the person fighting fashion's corner is key to&nbsp;good product. It will be fascinating to&nbsp;see what impact Earl has next season.</p><p>In part, the problem for M&S is that the competition has got so much better. The British high-street shopper is now thoroughly spoilt. Once, M&S filled a gap between fast fashion, which was cheap as chips but shoddily made, and the stodgy, elasticated-waistband fare of&nbsp;department store fashion. But the fast-fashion market has improved its production values, while a new category of grownup high street stores, such as Reiss and Cos, has emerged. M&S, once&nbsp;front and centre of our clothing consciousness, has to fight for airspace. There has been a tendency to fight for attention by filling the rails with \"trend-led\" clothes, which are often successful in winning media attention, but don't deliver strong sales on the shopfloor.</p><p>As a nation, we still identify strongly with M&S. It is a part of Britishness in a way no other brand is. Each of us has a an opinion on what M&S should be selling, just as every football fan has a view on the team their manager should field. Here's my own tuppenceworth on how M&S should alter their offer: by refining the colour palette. Walk on to the womenswear floor and you find yourself in a hectic, multicolour world. Less pink, yellow and red, and more bottle-green, navy and off-white would instantly update the environment. Yes, you might annoy the odd customer who was hellbent on fuschia, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.</p><p>The silver lining is that many women don't realise how much good stuff there still is in M&S. (I'm talking flagship stores. Sorry, provinces.) Recently I've bought a phenomenal leather pencil skirt with a gold zip, beautiful fabric and construction, for under £200, and a cream silk blouse with coral pocket borders that looks like it came from Paris for €200 rather than Oxford Street for £45.</p><h2><strong>Jenny Eclair, comedian and writer</strong></h2><p>I have had the almost overwhelming desire to snatch things out of the hands of women who are hovering around the Per Una stand, particularly when they are going into Per Una overdrive and getting everything to match. Per Una is the heroin of middle-aged women's clothing. You start off with just a little bit – maybe a waterfall cardigan in jade with some beading around the neckline. Snazzy. And before you know it, your wardrobe is bulging with appliqued skirts and embroidered jumpers. I think it's for those women who have completely lost their inner rock chick and have to find another path.</p><p>Marks & Spencer could very easily get it right if they kept it simple. Where they go wrong is when they start to ornament things with frills or beading. What people want is to go to M&S and buy a good mac, a good white shirt, a denim skirt, a&nbsp;jumper, maybe in cashmere. With their&nbsp;colour, they go a little bit lurid – I&nbsp;sometimes go in and it makes my teeth hurt. I do buy from Marks. I buy V-neck jumpers, and black cardigans.</p><p>There is a great demographic of peculiar women who can't wait to get to the appliqued-skirt time of life. There is still an M&S die-hard population – you see them in market towns. It's a shrinking breed of women, but I think Marks are still loyal to them.</p><p>I gig a lot, and M&S food has completely revolutionised touring, because they're at motorway service stations now. The days of Ginsters sausage rolls are over – now you can get chargrilled squid if you so desire. But I do think somebody needs to take a very stern hand with the clothes. They need to get some stylish middle-aged women, people like India Knight, who could actually just boss them around a bit. They have a terrible tendency to go for lilac clothes. I'd love to go on some kind of panel, giving a thumbs up or down as people were paraded in front of me.</p><h2><strong>Richard Perks, director of retail research, Mintel</strong></h2><p>There are two main drivers for M&S – womenswear and food. The food is doing well, but the problems are with the womenswear. They did the right thing in splitting it up into different sub-brands, but those brands are now insufficiently differentiated. They're also too \"old\". The great thing about Per Una when it launched was that it was young fashions engineered for older customers, but the \"young\" look has gone. Historically, you were dragged in there by your parents and swore never to go in again, and then around the age of 30 you happened to go in and thought, \"Oh, that's quite good.\" But it doesn't seem to be picking up those younger customers now. Debenhams is sitting where M&S should be, and does a good job, because its brands are differentiated.</p><p>There's a failure to understand what older people want. Sometimes you feel the merchandise is bought by a 25-year-old [M&S buyer] who has a caricatured granny in mind. Older people don't want to be sold down to. That is why Per Una did so well, because it looked young. That's what they've got to get back to.</p><p>M&S always did well in a recession – people went back to it because it was good quality and value. In boom times, it tended to over-engineer its products and they got too expensive. So it would have a bad start to the recession, but it would simplify its products, make them cheaper and clean up – that hasn't happened this time. I think Marc Bolland has to take responsibility for that.</p><p>Lead times are long – however much you like the idea of fast fashion, most things have to be planned in advance. Belinda Earl [former chief executive of&nbsp;Debenhams and Jaeger] joined in September, and she couldn't really have any significant impact until autumn/winter this year. Thing have drifted; they need to take those sub-brands and&nbsp;give them their own personality.</p><h2><strong>Lynne Franks, PR expert and champion for women's empowerment</strong></h2><p>I have bought from Marks & Spencer. Some of the basics are still pretty good and over the years they have had wonderful things – great cashmere, good knitwear. But I went in this season and there was nothing there I wanted to buy. I don't find it enticing, and that's a shame. There are always some good bits, but generally the shape is not right, the cut is not right. What would I suggest they do? Get a new design team.</p><p>A lot of women who are not young buy fashion, but wouldn't shop at M&S. I don't think M&S has to go younger, just do better stuff. Women of my age, 50-plus, have money to spend and love fashion. We grew up in the 1960s, and don't want to look like frumps. M&S could really take ownership of that market in the high street, but they have to realise the 50-plus woman today is much more stylish, and knowledgable than their mothers probably were.</p><h2><strong>Kim Winser, former chief executive of Pringle and Aquascutum, and director of womenswear at Marks & Spencer until 2000. Now runs </strong><a href=\"http://www.winserlondon.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Winser London</strong></a><strong>  </strong></h2><p>It's all about passion for product. That's what M&S has to turn its attention to – get back to really good, beautiful, quality products. I buy food from M&S, but not clothing – I haven't found that combination of fashionability, style and quality.</p><p>They do a number of different brand names – too many. By focusing on a few, they could use each brand to focus on a&nbsp;certain customer group, and gradually build up the value of that brand to that group – they will begin to love it and trust it&nbsp;and know it's for them.</p><p>When I was there we launched Autograph. It was about bringing in some of the best designers in&nbsp;Britain and&nbsp;capturing what they&nbsp;were good at. The designer collaborations can work, but only if it really does represent what that designer is famous for.</p><p>I don't think it's about the size of the company, I think it's about the people. There are too many excuses about business and bureaucracy, but the company is run by people, and I was definitely left to run womenswear, which at the time was a £2bn business. I&nbsp;was given that responsibility and accountability. I loved it, and as a team of people, that was one of the reasons we had market-share growth, because we really did love the customer and the product. So it can be done, whatever the&nbsp;size of the business, but I think it&nbsp;depends on the people.</p><p>Lifestyles change, and it's about a&nbsp;company constantly innovating, looking&nbsp;at what's happening and also predicting what's going to happen. To do that, you have to be absolutely in tune with your customer and what they want, and focus on what your brand is good at.

What's gone wrong? And how can it be put it right? We asked experts and fans to come up with an instant rescue plan</p><h2><strong>Kirstie Allsopp, TV presenter, also designs a homeware range for M&S</strong></h2><p>I'm very proud to have a range in Marks & Spencer, although I think I can be honest about what I feel. I used to buy a&nbsp;lot of clothing from M&S – I've always been a fan, and I adored their Autograph range [famous fashion designers were brought in to collaborate on collections]. There are fashion designers whose stuff I wouldn't buy at the top end, but who did a diffusion line for Autograph when it first&nbsp;started, and I have some pieces from that range that I still wear. But M&S doesn't have that any more.</p><p>When I talk to the girls at work – many of them in their mid- to late-20s and on low incomes – they tell me they shop at Primark. I don't see them buying anything from Marks & Spencer. It has become about the food, which out-cools and out-sexes the clothes. Something, somewhere got a little bit lost.</p><p>I trust Marks & Spencer, but I don't have the sense any more that I will make a real discovery. My fashion advice mainly comes from weekend newspaper supplements, and I don't see a lot of M&S stuff in them. I know they do makeup, shoes, accessories – but I can't&nbsp;remember the last time I saw something in a magazine and thought, \"ooh\", and then saw it was from M&S.</p><p>M&S can get its position back. The staff have a great attitude, and the company as a whole is a good one. I just think its womenswear has lost its edge.</p><h2><strong>Jess Cartner-Morley,  Guardian fashion editor</strong></h2><p>There is one straightforward factor contributing to M&S's woes. There is no one manning the tiller, fashionably speaking. The current collections fall between two reigns: they were conceived after Kate&nbsp;Bostock left last year, but have not been steered by her replacement, Belinda Earl – her influence will not be&nbsp;seen until the first autumn ranges land at the end of this summer. I have observed the dynamics at M&S for some time, and it strikes me that a healthy relationship between the CEO and the person fighting fashion's corner is key to&nbsp;good product. It will be fascinating to&nbsp;see what impact Earl has next season.</p><p>In part, the problem for M&S is that the competition has got so much better. The British high-street shopper is now thoroughly spoilt. Once, M&S filled a gap between fast fashion, which was cheap as chips but shoddily made, and the stodgy, elasticated-waistband fare of&nbsp;department store fashion. But the fast-fashion market has improved its production values, while a new category of grownup high street stores, such as Reiss and Cos, has emerged. M&S, once&nbsp;front and centre of our clothing consciousness, has to fight for airspace. There has been a tendency to fight for attention by filling the rails with \"trend-led\" clothes, which are often successful in winning media attention, but don't deliver strong sales on the shopfloor.</p><p>As a nation, we still identify strongly with M&S. It is a part of Britishness in a way no other brand is. Each of us has a an opinion on what M&S should be selling, just as every football fan has a view on the team their manager should field. Here's my own tuppenceworth on how M&S should alter their offer: by refining the colour palette. Walk on to the womenswear floor and you find yourself in a hectic, multicolour world. Less pink, yellow and red, and more bottle-green, navy and off-white would instantly update the environment. Yes, you might annoy the odd customer who was hellbent on fuschia, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.</p><p>The silver lining is that many women don't realise how much good stuff there still is in M&S. (I'm talking flagship stores. Sorry, provinces.) Recently I've bought a phenomenal leather pencil skirt with a gold zip, beautiful fabric and construction, for under £200, and a cream silk blouse with coral pocket borders that looks like it came from Paris for €200 rather than Oxford Street for £45.</p><h2><strong>Jenny Eclair, comedian and writer</strong></h2><p>I have had the almost overwhelming desire to snatch things out of the hands of women who are hovering around the Per Una stand, particularly when they are going into Per Una overdrive and getting everything to match. Per Una is the heroin of middle-aged women's clothing. You start off with just a little bit – maybe a waterfall cardigan in jade with some beading around the neckline. Snazzy. And before you know it, your wardrobe is bulging with appliqued skirts and embroidered jumpers. I think it's for those women who have completely lost their inner rock chick and have to find another path.</p><p>Marks & Spencer could very easily get it right if they kept it simple. Where they go wrong is when they start to ornament things with frills or beading. What people want is to go to M&S and buy a good mac, a good white shirt, a denim skirt, a&nbsp;jumper, maybe in cashmere. With their&nbsp;colour, they go a little bit lurid – I&nbsp;sometimes go in and it makes my teeth hurt. I do buy from Marks. I buy V-neck jumpers, and black cardigans.</p><p>There is a great demographic of peculiar women who can't wait to get to the appliqued-skirt time of life. There is still an M&S die-hard population – you see them in market towns. It's a shrinking breed of women, but I think Marks are still loyal to them.</p><p>I gig a lot, and M&S food has completely revolutionised touring, because they're at motorway service stations now. The days of Ginsters sausage rolls are over – now you can get chargrilled squid if you so desire. But I do think somebody needs to take a very stern hand with the clothes. They need to get some stylish middle-aged women, people like India Knight, who could actually just boss them around a bit. They have a terrible tendency to go for lilac clothes. I'd love to go on some kind of panel, giving a thumbs up or down as people were paraded in front of me.</p><h2><strong>Richard Perks, director of retail research, Mintel</strong></h2><p>There are two main drivers for M&S – womenswear and food. The food is doing well, but the problems are with the womenswear. They did the right thing in splitting it up into different sub-brands, but those brands are now insufficiently differentiated. They're also too \"old\". The great thing about Per Una when it launched was that it was young fashions engineered for older customers, but the \"young\" look has gone. Historically, you were dragged in there by your parents and swore never to go in again, and then around the age of 30 you happened to go in and thought, \"Oh, that's quite good.\" But it doesn't seem to be picking up those younger customers now. Debenhams is sitting where M&S should be, and does a good job, because its brands are differentiated.</p><p>There's a failure to understand what older people want. Sometimes you feel the merchandise is bought by a 25-year-old [M&S buyer] who has a caricatured granny in mind. Older people don't want to be sold down to. That is why Per Una did so well, because it looked young. That's what they've got to get back to.</p><p>M&S always did well in a recession – people went back to it because it was good quality and value. In boom times, it tended to over-engineer its products and they got too expensive. So it would have a bad start to the recession, but it would simplify its products, make them cheaper and clean up – that hasn't happened this time. I think Marc Bolland has to take responsibility for that.</p><p>Lead times are long – however much you like the idea of fast fashion, most things have to be planned in advance. Belinda Earl [former chief executive of&nbsp;Debenhams and Jaeger] joined in September, and she couldn't really have any significant impact until autumn/winter this year. Thing have drifted; they need to take those sub-brands and&nbsp;give them their own personality.</p><h2><strong>Lynne Franks, PR expert and champion for women's empowerment</strong></h2><p>I have bought from Marks & Spencer. Some of the basics are still pretty good and over the years they have had wonderful things – great cashmere, good knitwear. But I went in this season and there was nothing there I wanted to buy. I don't find it enticing, and that's a shame. There are always some good bits, but generally the shape is not right, the cut is not right. What would I suggest they do? Get a new design team.</p><p>A lot of women who are not young buy fashion, but wouldn't shop at M&S. I don't think M&S has to go younger, just do better stuff. Women of my age, 50-plus, have money to spend and love fashion. We grew up in the 1960s, and don't want to look like frumps. M&S could really take ownership of that market in the high street, but they have to realise the 50-plus woman today is much more stylish, and knowledgable than their mothers probably were.</p><h2><strong>Kim Winser, former chief executive of Pringle and Aquascutum, and director of womenswear at Marks & Spencer until 2000. Now runs </strong><a href=\"http://www.winserlondon.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Winser London</strong></a><strong>  </strong></h2><p>It's all about passion for product. That's what M&S has to turn its attention to – get back to really good, beautiful, quality products. I buy food from M&S, but not clothing – I haven't found that combination of fashionability, style and quality.</p><p>They do a number of different brand names – too many. By focusing on a few, they could use each brand to focus on a&nbsp;certain customer group, and gradually build up the value of that brand to that group – they will begin to love it and trust it&nbsp;and know it's for them.</p><p>When I was there we launched Autograph. It was about bringing in some of the best designers in&nbsp;Britain and&nbsp;capturing what they&nbsp;were good at. The designer collaborations can work, but only if it really does represent what that designer is famous for.</p><p>I don't think it's about the size of the company, I think it's about the people. There are too many excuses about business and bureaucracy, but the company is run by people, and I was definitely left to run womenswear, which at the time was a £2bn business. I&nbsp;was given that responsibility and accountability. I loved it, and as a team of people, that was one of the reasons we had market-share growth, because we really did love the customer and the product. So it can be done, whatever the&nbsp;size of the business, but I think it&nbsp;depends on the people.</p><p>Lifestyles change, and it's about a&nbsp;company constantly innovating, looking&nbsp;at what's happening and also predicting what's going to happen. To do that, you have to be absolutely in tune with your customer and what they want, and focus on what your brand is good at. I'm looking from the outside now, but that's where M&S was always a&nbsp;very successful business, because it put the customer first.</p><h2><strong>Susie Lau, fashion blogger for  </strong><a href=\"http://stylebubble.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Style Bubble</strong></a><br /></h2><p>M&S lacks focus in its product.

Pride parades with muscle boys in leather hot pants? Kylie Minogue? Antiquated drag queens miming to Shirley Bassey? \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/13/lip-service-groundbreaking-lesbian-drama\" title=\"\">Lip Service</a>\"?</p><p>A recent piece in The Huffington Post described Grindr as an example of \"gay culture\". For those unfamiliar with modern gay dating rituals, Grindr is an app which enables men to track the locations of potential sexual partners. First launched in 2009, it now claims to have four million users worldwide. In fact, so successful has Grindr been that it recently spawned a lesbian version, called FindHrr.</p><p>Is this what passes for gay culture these days? An app which offers the quickest, easiest way to arrange sexual hook-ups? If Grindr really is an example of gay culture then is dogging an example of \"straight culture\"? And if not, why not?</p><p>Britain's lesbian and gay community has made massive strides in recent years. We have an equal age of consent, employment rights and a whole raft of legal protections we didn't have a decade ago. Soon the UK will even follow in the footsteps of countries like Spain and South Africa and grant same sex couples the right to marry.</p><p>So where does that leave gay culture? For many people, gay culture begins and ends with the gay scene. There are gay magazines devoted to it, and gay people who devote their lives to it. And compared to many countries, we have a gay scene we can be proud of. But all is not well in this rosy pink world. The impact of <a href=\"http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/drug-epidemic-hitting-gay-men-hard010412\" title=\"\">drugs like GHB</a> has led to numerous deaths on the London gay scene. Next month, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the capital is hosting a panel discussion to address the problem. The fact that it's presented by someone called Sleazy Michael gives some idea of the target audience.</p><p>Of course, gay culture isn't confined to the scene. There's also the mainstream. Take television. A decade ago, people said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/15/channel4.gayrights\" title=\"\">Queer As Folk </a>had changed everything. But creator Russell T Davies was the first to admit that it hadn't. As wonderful as Queer As Folk was, it didn't change the way gay men are routinely portrayed on TV. We still have the familiar line-up of camp comedians we've had since the 1970s. The names have changed, but the mannerisms haven't. Once, gay men were associated with the wit and wisdom of Oscar Wilde. Now it's the huff and puff of – well, take your pick.</p><p>Coming up soon on ITV we have the much publicised sitcom Vicious, starring gay national treasures <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/05/ian-mckellen-derek-jacobi-vicious\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi</a>. The original title was Vicious Old Queens. Nothing wrong with that, of course. Such people exist. But this story could have been told 40 years ago – and was, with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase_%28film%29\" title=\"\">Richard Burton and Rex Harrison</a> as an older, squabbling gay couple in the film Staircase.</p><p>We've climbed a long way up the social ladder since Staircase was first shown in 1969. From this vantage point, it's easier to see things from a wider perspective. And with greater legislative freedoms, we have an opportunity to take a broader view of gay politics, and redefine what we mean by gay culture.</p><p>It was with this in mind that Guardian writer Julie Bindel and I decided to launch a new online magazine called <a href=\"http://www.gaze-amodernreview.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gaze – A Modern Review</a>.

Pride parades with muscle boys in leather hot pants? Kylie Minogue? Antiquated drag queens miming to Shirley Bassey? \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/13/lip-service-groundbreaking-lesbian-drama\" title=\"\">Lip Service</a>\"?</p><p>A recent piece in The Huffington Post described Grindr as an example of \"gay culture\". For those unfamiliar with modern gay dating rituals, Grindr is an app which enables men to track the locations of potential sexual partners. First launched in 2009, it now claims to have four million users worldwide. In fact, so successful has Grindr been that it recently spawned a lesbian version, called FindHrr.</p><p>Is this what passes for gay culture these days? An app which offers the quickest, easiest way to arrange sexual hook-ups? If Grindr really is an example of gay culture then is dogging an example of \"straight culture\"? And if not, why not?</p><p>Britain's lesbian and gay community has made massive strides in recent years. We have an equal age of consent, employment rights and a whole raft of legal protections we didn't have a decade ago. Soon the UK will even follow in the footsteps of countries like Spain and South Africa and grant same sex couples the right to marry.</p><p>So where does that leave gay culture? For many people, gay culture begins and ends with the gay scene. There are gay magazines devoted to it, and gay people who devote their lives to it. And compared to many countries, we have a gay scene we can be proud of. But all is not well in this rosy pink world. The impact of <a href=\"http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/drug-epidemic-hitting-gay-men-hard010412\" title=\"\">drugs like GHB</a> has led to numerous deaths on the London gay scene. Next month, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the capital is hosting a panel discussion to address the problem. The fact that it's presented by someone called Sleazy Michael gives some idea of the target audience.</p><p>Of course, gay culture isn't confined to the scene. There's also the mainstream. Take television. A decade ago, people said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/sep/15/channel4.gayrights\" title=\"\">Queer As Folk </a>had changed everything. But creator Russell T Davies was the first to admit that it hadn't. As wonderful as Queer As Folk was, it didn't change the way gay men are routinely portrayed on TV. We still have the familiar line-up of camp comedians we've had since the 1970s. The names have changed, but the mannerisms haven't. Once, gay men were associated with the wit and wisdom of Oscar Wilde. Now it's the huff and puff of – well, take your pick.</p><p>Coming up soon on ITV we have the much publicised sitcom Vicious, starring gay national treasures <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/05/ian-mckellen-derek-jacobi-vicious\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi</a>. The original title was Vicious Old Queens. Nothing wrong with that, of course. Such people exist. But this story could have been told 40 years ago – and was, with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase_%28film%29\" title=\"\">Richard Burton and Rex Harrison</a> as an older, squabbling gay couple in the film Staircase.</p><p>We've climbed a long way up the social ladder since Staircase was first shown in 1969. From this vantage point, it's easier to see things from a wider perspective. And with greater legislative freedoms, we have an opportunity to take a broader view of gay politics, and redefine what we mean by gay culture.</p><p>It was with this in mind that Guardian writer Julie Bindel and I decided to launch a new online magazine called <a href=\"http://www.gaze-amodernreview.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Gaze – A Modern Review</a>.

In real life, buying her own upmarket kitchen became a personal drama</p><p>In her role as strait-laced Saffy in long-running sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, Julia Sawalha spent a great deal of time in one of the most famous kitchens on British television, with its champagne-filled fridge and little-used oven. But the actor is now embroiled in a real-life kitchen drama.</p><p>Sawalha told Guardian Money she faced losing up to £15,000 after she decided to cancel an order for a new kitchen for the property she is restoring when the company upped the price after the deal was agreed.</p><p>She told us she was being \"excessively penalised\" after the firm refused to refund her £10,000 deposit then demanded she pay a further £5,000 to buy herself out of the contract. Sawalha claims the \"appalling\" way she was treated had left her in tears.</p><p>Luxury kitchen maker Chalon – whose designs regularly feature in upmarket property and interiors magazines – claimed that Sawalha had been \"unreasonable\" but told us it was \"close to reaching an amicable agreement\". There was talk of a refund of the bulk of the £10,000, but as Money went to press, Sawalha told us this had not materialised, despite a deadline having been set.</p><p>Sawalha, who is also well-known for her roles in BBC period dramas Lark Rise to Candleford, Cranford and Pride and Prejudice, is restoring her \"dream home\", a Grade I listed townhouse in Bath, which she spent years saving up for. She decided to treat herself to a Chalon kitchen, which are well-known for their \"distressed\" paint finishes: \"I've been salivating over their adverts in magazines for years.\"</p><p>Although Sawalha was planning to fork out a lot more than the average £8,000, she is far from alone in having a run-in with a kitchen firm. Which? says that around 40% of its members have experienced problems.</p><p>A friend alerted her to Money's consumer champions, who take up reader complaints without naming the individuals. We asked if she was willing to go on the record and she agreed. She told us that in January she visited Chalon's showroom in London's King's Road and was told she could have someone visit her home and draw up a design free of charge.</p><p>She says she made clear that she didn't want a kitchen \"island\" and preferred built-in units to separate pieces, because the latter would be too big for the room. However, she says that when she returned to the showroom, she was presented with a design for a \"separate piece\" kitchen, which included an island, with a total price-tag of £47,400.</p><p>Sawalha says she again made clear she didn't want separate pieces, and the designer agreed to change the design to a \"modular\" kitchen, bringing the cost down to £37,400. Based on this, she handed over a cheque for £10,000 on 4 February. Next day she decided she didn't want the island or the wall cupboard above it, and the designer agreed to remove them. With these two items valued at a total of £9,480, she assumed this would take the cost down to £27,900.</p><p>Sawalha says that for two weeks she heard nothing, and with her electrician \"champing at the bit,\" had to chase the firm. It eventually sent her a new quote which appears to omit the island and cupboard, but is for £39,700 – more than the originally agreed amount, she says. Oddly, this quote states that the deposit amount is £13,115.</p><p>Sawalha asked how the quote could be higher after the two pieces had been removed, and said she was \"becoming more and more confused and, quite frankly, stressed with the way things are progressing\". Next day she received an email apologising for the \"confusion\". It stated that \"we can bring the kitchen to around £37,000\", and that Sawalha would be sent \"a revised quote and plan\" following the engineer's visit.</p><p>\"I was shocked to learn there would be a revised quote, and alarm bells started to ring,\" she says. \"As far as I'm concerned, a company doesn't sell a product at a certain price then increase the price once the deal has been agreed. I thought: where will they draw the line?\"</p><p>On 22 February she emailed Chalon to say that as she could not seem to get any clear answers, she didn't wish to go ahead and wanted her deposit refunded. However, the company declined. On 2 March, it did offer her the kitchen she wanted for £27,900, from which her deposit would be deducted, plus a free piece of furniture \"as a thank you for your patience\", but Sawalha says: \"By this point I was extremely stressed and did not trust them at all, and the thought of having to look at their kitchen for the next 20 years after all the upset they had caused was simply not an option.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the end of the matter. This month Chalon emailed Sawalha's solicitor to say that it \"would look for £15,000 in compensation to include its administrative costs and loss of profit\" – ie, she would have to pay an extra £5,000 to escape the contract.</p><p>The actor says: \"My solicitors have told them no losses have been incurred. The designer's service was free of charge, no engineer visited the property and the kitchen never went into production. To be so excessively penalised for changing my mind… I can't understand how I can be charged £10,000-£15,000 for a product that hasn't even been made.\"</p><p>She adds that she was not given a contract to sign.

In real life, buying her own upmarket kitchen became a personal drama</p><p>In her role as strait-laced Saffy in long-running sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, Julia Sawalha spent a great deal of time in one of the most famous kitchens on British television, with its champagne-filled fridge and little-used oven. But the actor is now embroiled in a real-life kitchen drama.</p><p>Sawalha told Guardian Money she faced losing up to £15,000 after she decided to cancel an order for a new kitchen for the property she is restoring when the company upped the price after the deal was agreed.</p><p>She told us she was being \"excessively penalised\" after the firm refused to refund her £10,000 deposit then demanded she pay a further £5,000 to buy herself out of the contract. Sawalha claims the \"appalling\" way she was treated had left her in tears.</p><p>Luxury kitchen maker Chalon – whose designs regularly feature in upmarket property and interiors magazines – claimed that Sawalha had been \"unreasonable\" but told us it was \"close to reaching an amicable agreement\". There was talk of a refund of the bulk of the £10,000, but as Money went to press, Sawalha told us this had not materialised, despite a deadline having been set.</p><p>Sawalha, who is also well-known for her roles in BBC period dramas Lark Rise to Candleford, Cranford and Pride and Prejudice, is restoring her \"dream home\", a Grade I listed townhouse in Bath, which she spent years saving up for. She decided to treat herself to a Chalon kitchen, which are well-known for their \"distressed\" paint finishes: \"I've been salivating over their adverts in magazines for years.\"</p><p>Although Sawalha was planning to fork out a lot more than the average £8,000, she is far from alone in having a run-in with a kitchen firm. Which? says that around 40% of its members have experienced problems.</p><p>A friend alerted her to Money's consumer champions, who take up reader complaints without naming the individuals. We asked if she was willing to go on the record and she agreed. She told us that in January she visited Chalon's showroom in London's King's Road and was told she could have someone visit her home and draw up a design free of charge.</p><p>She says she made clear that she didn't want a kitchen \"island\" and preferred built-in units to separate pieces, because the latter would be too big for the room. However, she says that when she returned to the showroom, she was presented with a design for a \"separate piece\" kitchen, which included an island, with a total price-tag of £47,400.</p><p>Sawalha says she again made clear she didn't want separate pieces, and the designer agreed to change the design to a \"modular\" kitchen, bringing the cost down to £37,400. Based on this, she handed over a cheque for £10,000 on 4 February. Next day she decided she didn't want the island or the wall cupboard above it, and the designer agreed to remove them. With these two items valued at a total of £9,480, she assumed this would take the cost down to £27,900.</p><p>Sawalha says that for two weeks she heard nothing, and with her electrician \"champing at the bit,\" had to chase the firm. It eventually sent her a new quote which appears to omit the island and cupboard, but is for £39,700 – more than the originally agreed amount, she says. Oddly, this quote states that the deposit amount is £13,115.</p><p>Sawalha asked how the quote could be higher after the two pieces had been removed, and said she was \"becoming more and more confused and, quite frankly, stressed with the way things are progressing\". Next day she received an email apologising for the \"confusion\". It stated that \"we can bring the kitchen to around £37,000\", and that Sawalha would be sent \"a revised quote and plan\" following the engineer's visit.</p><p>\"I was shocked to learn there would be a revised quote, and alarm bells started to ring,\" she says. \"As far as I'm concerned, a company doesn't sell a product at a certain price then increase the price once the deal has been agreed. I thought: where will they draw the line?\"</p><p>On 22 February she emailed Chalon to say that as she could not seem to get any clear answers, she didn't wish to go ahead and wanted her deposit refunded. However, the company declined. On 2 March, it did offer her the kitchen she wanted for £27,900, from which her deposit would be deducted, plus a free piece of furniture \"as a thank you for your patience\", but Sawalha says: \"By this point I was extremely stressed and did not trust them at all, and the thought of having to look at their kitchen for the next 20 years after all the upset they had caused was simply not an option.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the end of the matter. This month Chalon emailed Sawalha's solicitor to say that it \"would look for £15,000 in compensation to include its administrative costs and loss of profit\" – ie, she would have to pay an extra £5,000 to escape the contract.</p><p>The actor says: \"My solicitors have told them no losses have been incurred. The designer's service was free of charge, no engineer visited the property and the kitchen never went into production. To be so excessively penalised for changing my mind… I can't understand how I can be charged £10,000-£15,000 for a product that hasn't even been made.\"</p><p>She adds that she was not given a contract to sign. However, the company told her in an email that a legal contract had been made, adding: \"In your case, you gave the deposit over rather than signed a contract.\"</p><p>Sawalha says of the saga: \"It's put a huge cloud over my whole restoration project and is holding things up massively. I feel utterly depressed every time I walk into the kitchen. At the end of the day there are a lot worse things going on in the world, but at the same time it's a huge amount of stress I could do without.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/homeimprovements\">Home improvements</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs\">Consumer affairs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-rights-money\">Consumer rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/property\">Property</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/homes\">Homes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rupertjones\">Rupert Jones</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

What are his hopes and fears? How does he deal with change? Where did he get that hat? Are those Findus Crispy Pancakes? Why is he shouting at us to get off his porch? Ooh, is that a gun? These and other vexed questions are addressed in the first episode of <strong>America In Primetime</strong> (<em>Saturday, 10.15pm, BBC2</em>), a wholly engrossing four-part stare through the net curtains of US TV. It's a weighty 2011 PBS series gently Britished-up by the BBC, with tonight's opener taking a thorough squint at the history of that most familiar and conflicted of fictional small-screen idols: the primetime patriarch. An introductory \"representative domestic incidents\" montage invites us to feel the width of the bugger's MO. Dick Van Dyke skipping through his front door in a trilby; Homer Simpson telling daughter Lisa that, hey, just because he doesn't <em>care</em> doesn't mean he doesn't <em>understand</em>; Tony Soprano burying his face in a metaphor for modern masculinity that's also a plate of linguine. Here, says America In Primetime, is a figure that encapsulates 60 years of American TV maleness, from the sexless omniscience of the postwar breadwinner to the achy-breaky self-doubt of today's Mr Boo Hoos.</p><p>\"He just wishes he could get a little bit of peace and quiet once in a while,\" says Carl Reiner of this perturbed cultural touchstone. \"He is looking for meaning and not finding it,\" says Sopranos creator David Chase. \"It isn't always easy to glean the true nature of homo domesticus,\" warns presenter Alan Yentob, turning up in a shirt the colour of conjunctivitis. But never mind him. Apparently, what it all boils down to is balls. Fifties dad had a heart and a briefcase but \"no balls\". But then, \"Finally!\" bellows a pundit of The Cosby Show's unyielding Cliff Huxtable, \"a dad that had SOME BALLS.\"</p><p>The balls continue to bounce through an absorbing roundup of modern TV neuroses: from the conflicted clock-weights of the cable-drama antihero to the flattened testicular pucks of the perennially abused sitcom schlub. Eventually, we arrive at the gulping, tremulous creature first seen in wildly influential baby-boomer blubathon Thirtysomething: his masculinity as over-thought as his designer beard; his scrotum little more than a sliver of (organic, locally sourced) luncheon meat flapping in the postmodern, post-second-wave-feminism breeze. Not that feminism gets much of a look-in here. In fact, female characters and the impact of women's changing roles on homo domesticus are barely mentioned at all (although there are numerous corking talking-head contributions from the likes of Roseanne Barr and Diablo Cody). This is a strictly chaps-only club. The clips do sit-ups and the anecdotes wear Paco Rabanne, and yet this ploy works brilliantly. What could have been an empty 21-gun trouser salute to the majestic preeminence of man is instead a thoughtful, concentrated study of the primetime patriarch as a discrete and ever-evolving entity. (Besides which, a later episode is devoted entirely to the depiction of small-screen ladies. So, y'know, woo hoo.)</p><p>We end with a look at Mad Men's Don Draper and Breaking Bad's Walter White: two sides of the same misery coin and the perfect demonstration of Ron Howard's assertion that \"TV is becoming literature\". So to the inevitable grumble: where are the British small-screen heroes? God knows there's nothing duller than the endless \"they're-better-no-we're-better-oh-why-can't-we-all-be-friends\" UK vs US TV \"debate\" but sod it: where are our believable patriarchs? Our Walter Whites? Our long-running, life-changing dramas in which devastating, excoriating self-examination doesn't mean someone blowing his nose in Holby City, or the unbearable lightness of being Stephen Tompkinson? If America In Primetime knows, it isn't telling. Waiter! A wheelbarrow for this series' balls.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sarahdempster\">Sarah Dempster</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But then, \"Finally!\" bellows a pundit of The Cosby Show's unyielding Cliff Huxtable, \"a dad that had SOME BALLS.\"</p><p>The balls continue to bounce through an absorbing roundup of modern TV neuroses: from the conflicted clock-weights of the cable-drama antihero to the flattened testicular pucks of the perennially abused sitcom schlub. Eventually, we arrive at the gulping, tremulous creature first seen in wildly influential baby-boomer blubathon Thirtysomething: his masculinity as over-thought as his designer beard; his scrotum little more than a sliver of (organic, locally sourced) luncheon meat flapping in the postmodern, post-second-wave-feminism breeze. Not that feminism gets much of a look-in here. In fact, female characters and the impact of women's changing roles on homo domesticus are barely mentioned at all (although there are numerous corking talking-head contributions from the likes of Roseanne Barr and Diablo Cody). This is a strictly chaps-only club. The clips do sit-ups and the anecdotes wear Paco Rabanne, and yet this ploy works brilliantly. What could have been an empty 21-gun trouser salute to the majestic preeminence of man is instead a thoughtful, concentrated study of the primetime patriarch as a discrete and ever-evolving entity. (Besides which, a later episode is devoted entirely to the depiction of small-screen ladies. So, y'know, woo hoo.)</p><p>We end with a look at Mad Men's Don Draper and Breaking Bad's Walter White: two sides of the same misery coin and the perfect demonstration of Ron Howard's assertion that \"TV is becoming literature\". So to the inevitable grumble: where are the British small-screen heroes? God knows there's nothing duller than the endless \"they're-better-no-we're-better-oh-why-can't-we-all-be-friends\" UK vs US TV \"debate\" but sod it: where are our believable patriarchs? Our Walter Whites? Our long-running, life-changing dramas in which devastating, excoriating self-examination doesn't mean someone blowing his nose in Holby City, or the unbearable lightness of being Stephen Tompkinson? If America In Primetime knows, it isn't telling. Waiter! A wheelbarrow for this series' balls.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/documentary\">Documentary</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/factual-tv\">Factual TV</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sarahdempster\">Sarah Dempster</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now where <em>have</em> we heard that one before? This is potentially treacherous ground, since last time they did something similar they came up with one of the most beloved episodes ever, in Blink.

The sepia-tinted 1970s, all blouses, polygraphs and Edinburgh-crystal whisky glasses, makes for an atmospheric awayday in this crooked pile. Despite all that, The Witch of the Well turns out to have a proper sci-fi explanation behind her (complete with a now-obligatory element to the story of love saving the day). The danger itself, like the story, is not huge: a human mystery in need of resolution rather than a high-stakes, Earth-threatening standoff, but its tension was just right for such a small-scale, contained and atmospheric tale.

The ship seems to think the new companion is a right piece of work, something that will no doubt pay off in next week's story, Journey to the Centre of the Tardis. This, though, was the first episode Jenna-Louise filmed, and it shows a little: she's  not completely there yet with the character or the relationship. It can never be easy writing a companion you've never seen on screen, but lines such as: \"I dispute that assertion,\" and, \"Whisky is the eleventh worst ever invented,\" don't sound quite like the sort of things anyone would actually say. Actually the whole script felt a bit too writerly and the dialogue jarred a touch – as if the writer was showing off a bit but it doesn't quite ring true. See also: \"There's a sliver of ice in his heart.\"</p><h2>Fear factor</h2><p>Yes, this worked most of all because it was properly chilling, not just in the candlelit corridors of Caliburn House, but in the forests of the sub-universe. When the Doctor declares \"I am scared\", he might be chiding the monster, but it sounds convincing.</p><p>Director Jamie Payne, a newcomer to the show, handles the scares deftly, with an old-fashioned it's-behind-you! approach to ramping up the tension. And in a show where even the scariest monsters can have a tendency for the cute, here was one that made you take a good few steps back to toward the back of the sofa with every glimpse. Fantastic.</p><h2>Mysteries and questions</h2><p>The twist at the end is that the Doctor has lied to Clara about their visit to Dorset; his increasing obsession with her led him there to see whether Emma the Empath could shed any light on the mystery of the impossible girl. But she can't offer anything more substantial than that she's real, normal and more scared than she lets on. Still, for the Doctor she's now \"the only mystery worth solving\". And while the reality of time travel would be difficult for anyone to get their heads round, Clara herself is starting to twig that everything's not quite as it should be. \"Not everything ends,\" says Emma. \"Not love, not always.\" Is that the clue to it all?

Their creator, Nick Park, will be at their side as visitors try out the Thrill-O-Matic, the £5.25m new jewel in the crown of the Blackpool Pleasure Beach amusement park.</p><p>\"I grew up in Preston, which is just down the road, so Blackpool feels like a natural home for Wallace and Gromit,\" said Park.</p><p>The ride – the result of three years of planning by Aardman and the amusement park staff – will take passengers, seated in a giant slipper, through key scenes from the films, including A Matter of Loaf and Death and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The park promises lots of special effects and some careful detailing, such as a holiday brochure to the moon and functioning representations of some of the contraptions invented by Wallace. Themed goods, including cheese-flavoured Blackpool \"Moon Rock\" and modelling clay kits, will be sold in the first Wallace and Gromit merchandise shop too.</p><p>Park revealed his plan to build a ride at Blackpool when he appeared on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2010. \"It is not going to be a hair-raising, terrifying ride; it is a family-friendly ride. It's nice because they are a family-run business and Blackpool is just down the road. I used to go down there as a kid for the switching on of the lights and so it feels right,\" he said.</p><p>The Thrill-O-Matic ride replaces the Gold Mine run. Some veteran fans of the Pleasure Beach have been reluctant to see change – mourning the passing of the Blue Grotto cafe, as well as favourite old rides such as Turtle Chase and the Whip. Both were replaced during the modernising reign of the managing director, Amanda Thompson, great-granddaughter of William G Bean who founded the 17-hectare (42-acre) theme park in 1896.</p><p>The Aardman animator chose the site of the first Wallace and Gromit fun ride amid competing offers from around the world.

Their creator, Nick Park, will be at their side as visitors try out the Thrill-O-Matic, the £5.25m new jewel in the crown of the Blackpool Pleasure Beach amusement park.</p><p>\"I grew up in Preston, which is just down the road, so Blackpool feels like a natural home for Wallace and Gromit,\" said Park.</p><p>The ride – the result of three years of planning by Aardman and the amusement park staff – will take passengers, seated in a giant slipper, through key scenes from the films, including A Matter of Loaf and Death and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The park promises lots of special effects and some careful detailing, such as a holiday brochure to the moon and functioning representations of some of the contraptions invented by Wallace. Themed goods, including cheese-flavoured Blackpool \"Moon Rock\" and modelling clay kits, will be sold in the first Wallace and Gromit merchandise shop too.</p><p>Park revealed his plan to build a ride at Blackpool when he appeared on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2010. \"It is not going to be a hair-raising, terrifying ride; it is a family-friendly ride. It's nice because they are a family-run business and Blackpool is just down the road. I used to go down there as a kid for the switching on of the lights and so it feels right,\" he said.</p><p>The Thrill-O-Matic ride replaces the Gold Mine run. Some veteran fans of the Pleasure Beach have been reluctant to see change – mourning the passing of the Blue Grotto cafe, as well as favourite old rides such as Turtle Chase and the Whip. Both were replaced during the modernising reign of the managing director, Amanda Thompson, great-granddaughter of William G Bean who founded the 17-hectare (42-acre) theme park in 1896.</p><p>The Aardman animator chose the site of the first Wallace and Gromit fun ride amid competing offers from around the world. Its launch will also mark the start of a crusading English summer for his two best-known creations.</p><p>For Wallace and Gromit are about to follow the likes of Julie Walters, Judi Dench, Jamie Oliver, Stephen Fry and Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint, and front campaigns to encourage people to holiday at home in England. A television advert will be broadcast early next month that will see the animated characters travelling around England in their trademark motorbike and sidecar on a road trip intended to highlight tourist attractions.</p><p>The VisitEngland tourist board has recruited the duo to inspire Britons to take a \"staycation\" this year in a £4.5m government-funded push called Great Adventure.

Does it feel miraculous that it got written at all?</strong></p><p>It does. I'm amazed. I really, really thought I'd never be able to write again. I had long months of catatonic, unable-to-get-out-of-bedness and then long months of this incredible fear, in the grip of panic. So the book was written very peculiarly. There was no steadiness to it. It took much longer than anything else I've written … I veered off into making cakes for about a year. I was wondering quite seriously: \"Could baking be my job?\" And I'm still not 100% so anything I managed to produce is a miracle.</p><p></p><p><strong>It must have been terrifying to feel like&nbsp;that...</strong></p><p>I've always been prone to depression, and I've been very public about my alcoholism even though I haven't had a drink in 19 years. I thought because I was addressing my issues on a daily basis I wouldn't be one of those people who suddenly blew, but I did. I can still feel the fear. It was very primal. It wasn't anxiety – I was terrified and everything looked different. It felt like I'd landed on another planet and it was horrific. I was just so frightened all the time. But all I was diagnosed with was depression and anxiety. I'm not bipolar, I'm not schizophrenic, but obviously something did shift in my head.</p><p></p><p><strong>There's a point in the book where your no-nonsense heroine Helen Walsh has just been diagnosed with depression and has trouble taking it in because she thinks: \"There was no such thing as depression… Muffins, that was the cure.\" Did you struggle with acceptance of it?</strong></p><p>In a way yes. I've always been melancholic. At a party, everyone would be looking at the glittering chandeliers and I'd be looking at the waitress's cracked shoes. But the catatonia, the being unable to sleep … it was a shock to me that actually, this was far worse.</p><p></p><p><strong>There's also a scene where Helen buys a Stanley knife and makes an elaborate plan to slit her wrists in a hotel room, leaving a note of apology in English and Polish for the chambermaid who might find her body. Did you do that?</strong></p><p>I did. Twice. I had two goes going out assembling the whole kit and buying paper and Sellotape to write the note. The conversation Helen has with the man in the shop, I actually had that, with him asking: \"What is it you're proposing to cut?\" It was so bizarre to be standing in a DIY shop, buying a knife to open my veins with. I was absolutely going through who would find me, leaving money for her to apologise… I wasn't in my right mind.</p><p></p><p><strong>I read somewhere that you knew something was wrong when you started finding the sight of Prada handbags frightening...</strong></p><p>It was dreadful! I was at the airport – I'd been on holiday but had to come home early, and I was in Duty Free. Normally I'd be breaking my neck to get in there. But there is something in Miuccia Prada's vision that is slightly sinister isn't there?</p><p></p><p><strong>Have you got over that?</strong></p><p>I have – more's the pity really! I had a great spell of buying absolutely nothing. I lived in the same three pairs of jeans for a year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it true that <em>Come Dine With Me </em>got you through some of your lowest points?</strong></p><p>Oh. My. God. Literally not joking, it saved my life. I loved your Dave Lamb [the narrator]. It's so very, very involving. It's about human beings, it's fun and it's short. I was at the stage when I was counting the minutes to get through a certain time so <em>Come Dine With Me </em>was great because I could watch it and be half an hour closer to sunset. Even now, at sunset, something lifts off me. That's how it is. Some days are better than others.</p><p></p><p><strong>So how are you today?</strong></p><p>I'm uneasy, which is huge progress. I'm not looking for pity, I'm really not, but I'm constantly uneasy and every day it is pretty much like getting up and going to war. Once I shift into the mindset of \"Yeah, you're alive. It's tough. Let's do what we can today,\" it's easier. The big mistake I made was thinking that happiness is the default position. Whereas it's just one of the countless states of mind we endure. I've kind of realised life is meant to be tough and everybody is in psychic and spiritual discomfort of some sort and has a burden to carry. I've realised I'm not special.</p><p></p><p><strong>But you're renowned as a funny writer. Is it difficult to write humour when you're in this state of mind?</strong></p><p>At the risk of sounding like a big boasty boaster, to be funny is easier for me than anything else. I feel very lucky because I think it's genetic. My mother has this way of structuring sentences that is extremely, uproariously funny. I think, also, coming from Ireland – it's a huge cliche but I think we have a different vocabulary and we structure our sentences according to the rhythms of the old language we used to speak. It's more colourful and more entertaining. And then, of course, I suppose Irish people do put so much value on anecdote. It's almost a competitive sport.</p><p></p><p><strong>Although your novels are often tagged as chick lit, they tackle serious issues. In the past, you've written about domestic violence, drug addiction and bereavement. Are there any topics you wouldn't take on?</strong></p><p>Never say never. I used to think I would never write about domestic violence because I didn't want to do it wrong, I didn't want to do a disservice to the women who had been through it. Then I was just so interested in it, in how rife it is and how secretive and ashamed the women are who have been through it, that I did it anyway. I've covered nearly everything.</p><p></p><p><strong>You describe yourself as a feminist. Do you think publishing is a sexist industry?</strong></p><p>This is hard, now, to answer. I don't know if it's sexist but it's just so genderised. The way much of women's fiction is marketed and packaged, it could be called sexist. But then I suppose crime writers might also feel marginalised. I think it's inevitable that publishers who are essentially purveyors are going to package the product in a way that reaches an optimal marketplace. I think reviewers are sexist… This isn't to sound bitter but I think you're more likely to get a critical kicking if you're a woman. I just think that's a fact. I really think less value is put in general on women's voices, across the&nbsp;board.</p><p></p><p><strong>You turn 50 later this year. Are you having a party?</strong></p><p>I'm not. Christ alive, I'd rather fling myself into the canal. Being the centre of attention – it's a vision of hell for me. I'm going to go to Pizza Express down the road. I have no fear of turning 50 whatsoever. I love getting older. I've always felt the world expects less of me as I get older so I'm free to be more and more eccentric. I've no regrets. Jesus, I wouldn't have my 20s back for all the money in the universe... I can't wait to be 70.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marian-keyes\">Marian Keyes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/depression\">Depression</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/chick-lit\">Chick lit</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mental-health\">Mental health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/come-dine-with-me\">Come Dine With Me</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/prada\">Prada</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction\">Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/elizabethday\">Elizabeth Day</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I lived in the same three pairs of jeans for a year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it true that <em>Come Dine With Me </em>got you through some of your lowest points?</strong></p><p>Oh. My. God. Literally not joking, it saved my life. I loved your Dave Lamb [the narrator]. It's so very, very involving. It's about human beings, it's fun and it's short. I was at the stage when I was counting the minutes to get through a certain time so <em>Come Dine With Me </em>was great because I could watch it and be half an hour closer to sunset. Even now, at sunset, something lifts off me. That's how it is. Some days are better than others.</p><p></p><p><strong>So how are you today?</strong></p><p>I'm uneasy, which is huge progress. I'm not looking for pity, I'm really not, but I'm constantly uneasy and every day it is pretty much like getting up and going to war. Once I shift into the mindset of \"Yeah, you're alive. It's tough. Let's do what we can today,\" it's easier. The big mistake I made was thinking that happiness is the default position. Whereas it's just one of the countless states of mind we endure. I've kind of realised life is meant to be tough and everybody is in psychic and spiritual discomfort of some sort and has a burden to carry. I've realised I'm not special.</p><p></p><p><strong>But you're renowned as a funny writer. Is it difficult to write humour when you're in this state of mind?</strong></p><p>At the risk of sounding like a big boasty boaster, to be funny is easier for me than anything else. I feel very lucky because I think it's genetic. My mother has this way of structuring sentences that is extremely, uproariously funny. I think, also, coming from Ireland – it's a huge cliche but I think we have a different vocabulary and we structure our sentences according to the rhythms of the old language we used to speak. It's more colourful and more entertaining. And then, of course, I suppose Irish people do put so much value on anecdote. It's almost a competitive sport.</p><p></p><p><strong>Although your novels are often tagged as chick lit, they tackle serious issues. In the past, you've written about domestic violence, drug addiction and bereavement. Are there any topics you wouldn't take on?</strong></p><p>Never say never. I used to think I would never write about domestic violence because I didn't want to do it wrong, I didn't want to do a disservice to the women who had been through it. Then I was just so interested in it, in how rife it is and how secretive and ashamed the women are who have been through it, that I did it anyway. I've covered nearly everything.</p><p></p><p><strong>You describe yourself as a feminist. Do you think publishing is a sexist industry?</strong></p><p>This is hard, now, to answer. I don't know if it's sexist but it's just so genderised. The way much of women's fiction is marketed and packaged, it could be called sexist. But then I suppose crime writers might also feel marginalised. I think it's inevitable that publishers who are essentially purveyors are going to package the product in a way that reaches an optimal marketplace. I think reviewers are sexist… This isn't to sound bitter but I think you're more likely to get a critical kicking if you're a woman. I just think that's a fact. I really think less value is put in general on women's voices, across the&nbsp;board.</p><p></p><p><strong>You turn 50 later this year. Are you having a party?</strong></p><p>I'm not. Christ alive, I'd rather fling myself into the canal. Being the centre of attention – it's a vision of hell for me. I'm going to go to Pizza Express down the road. I have no fear of turning 50 whatsoever. I love getting older. I've always felt the world expects less of me as I get older so I'm free to be more and more eccentric. I've no regrets. Jesus, I wouldn't have my 20s back for all the money in the universe... I can't wait to be 70.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marian-keyes\">Marian Keyes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/depression\">Depression</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/chick-lit\">Chick lit</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mental-health\">Mental health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/come-dine-with-me\">Come Dine With Me</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/prada\">Prada</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction\">Fiction</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/elizabethday\">Elizabeth Day</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It doesn't tiptoe around issues – it bashes down their door and runs through them with boots on. In <em>Casualty</em>, cars are leather-seated smash-smash machines. In <em>Casualty</em>, windows are brittle mouths of doom. If I were mayor of the fictional town of Holby I&nbsp;would pedestrianise the hell out of it. I'd compress every tower block into a bungalow and enforce compulsory parachutes for everyone with cause to climb a ladder. But <em>Casualty</em>'s lack of subtlety, its very black-and-whiteness, is why it was exactly the right forum to&nbsp;address <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> for the first time in British drama.</p><p>This is what happened <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/12/casualty-spotlight-female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">on BBC1 at 9.10pm on Saturday, </a>with 5 million people watching. Tamasha wanted to protect her little sister from being cut like her. The doctors were debating whether to get involved: \"It's too culturally sensitive,\" argued one. \"It's complex.\" \"Typical liberal excuse,\" replied the nurse. Meanwhile the sisters' pregnant mother was going into early labour, and upon inspecting her, Dr Hanna learned she was \"closed\". In one of those great flashes of <em>Casualty</em> karma, when Tamasha caught up with the private doctor on his way to the cutting party and ran him off the road in her mother's car, he suffered massive trauma to his genitals. Dr Hanna and Tamasha drove to a terraced house, where, in the absence of the private doctor, two little girls had been cut by their grandmother – one lay unconscious in a pool of blood and urine.</p><p>There were some concerns online before it aired, commenters saying the BBC shouldn't show the story because it would be upsetting viewing, and it was – it was upsetting. But this isn't the time for <em>Newsnight</em> or <em>Panorama</em>. This is the time for family TV, for faces we recognise, for blood and broad strokes of script. There's little room for subtlety any more. Not when we're talking about the removal of more than 66,000 women's clitorises in the UK alone, with 20,000 more (16,000 of whom are under 15) at risk. About the cutting of their labia, sometimes the sewing up of their vaginas, leaving only a tiny opening for blood and urine.</p><p>It's partly because of this – the language required to talk about it – that discussion about FGM remains in the serious bits of the paper, only alluded to on grown-up television and debated in Parliament. It's partly because of this, and partly because it's seen as a&nbsp;potentially incendiary problem, with teachers and doctors reluctant to intervene for fear of appearing racist or interfering in traditions they don't quite understand.</p><p>Germaine Greer once argued that attempts to outlaw genital mutilation amounted to \"an attack on cultural identity\", and she wasn't alone. Over time, advocates for cultural self-determination have quieted slightly as human rights arguments have been clarified, but there's still the worry. That by calling social services when you suspect that your student's summer holiday (for this is when it often happens) will involve her being held down by six women while her genitals are cut, you will come across as insensitive. Yet if there was the real threat of a child being blinded, say, or a limb amputated, you would react at speed.</p><p>Despite it being illegal to perform FGM here, and to take children out  of the country to have it performed, there has never been a single conviction. The lack of arrests says terrible things about our ignorance, our apathy and, crucially, our ideas about female sexuality.</p><p>So yeah, the time for subtlety has passed.

It doesn't tiptoe around issues – it bashes down their door and runs through them with boots on. In <em>Casualty</em>, cars are leather-seated smash-smash machines. In <em>Casualty</em>, windows are brittle mouths of doom. If I were mayor of the fictional town of Holby I&nbsp;would pedestrianise the hell out of it. I'd compress every tower block into a bungalow and enforce compulsory parachutes for everyone with cause to climb a ladder. But <em>Casualty</em>'s lack of subtlety, its very black-and-whiteness, is why it was exactly the right forum to&nbsp;address <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> for the first time in British drama.</p><p>This is what happened <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/12/casualty-spotlight-female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">on BBC1 at 9.10pm on Saturday, </a>with 5 million people watching. Tamasha wanted to protect her little sister from being cut like her. The doctors were debating whether to get involved: \"It's too culturally sensitive,\" argued one. \"It's complex.\" \"Typical liberal excuse,\" replied the nurse. Meanwhile the sisters' pregnant mother was going into early labour, and upon inspecting her, Dr Hanna learned she was \"closed\". In one of those great flashes of <em>Casualty</em> karma, when Tamasha caught up with the private doctor on his way to the cutting party and ran him off the road in her mother's car, he suffered massive trauma to his genitals. Dr Hanna and Tamasha drove to a terraced house, where, in the absence of the private doctor, two little girls had been cut by their grandmother – one lay unconscious in a pool of blood and urine.</p><p>There were some concerns online before it aired, commenters saying the BBC shouldn't show the story because it would be upsetting viewing, and it was – it was upsetting. But this isn't the time for <em>Newsnight</em> or <em>Panorama</em>. This is the time for family TV, for faces we recognise, for blood and broad strokes of script. There's little room for subtlety any more. Not when we're talking about the removal of more than 66,000 women's clitorises in the UK alone, with 20,000 more (16,000 of whom are under 15) at risk. About the cutting of their labia, sometimes the sewing up of their vaginas, leaving only a tiny opening for blood and urine.</p><p>It's partly because of this – the language required to talk about it – that discussion about FGM remains in the serious bits of the paper, only alluded to on grown-up television and debated in Parliament. It's partly because of this, and partly because it's seen as a&nbsp;potentially incendiary problem, with teachers and doctors reluctant to intervene for fear of appearing racist or interfering in traditions they don't quite understand.</p><p>Germaine Greer once argued that attempts to outlaw genital mutilation amounted to \"an attack on cultural identity\", and she wasn't alone. Over time, advocates for cultural self-determination have quieted slightly as human rights arguments have been clarified, but there's still the worry. That by calling social services when you suspect that your student's summer holiday (for this is when it often happens) will involve her being held down by six women while her genitals are cut, you will come across as insensitive. Yet if there was the real threat of a child being blinded, say, or a limb amputated, you would react at speed.</p><p>Despite it being illegal to perform FGM here, and to take children out  of the country to have it performed, there has never been a single conviction. The lack of arrests says terrible things about our ignorance, our apathy and, crucially, our ideas about female sexuality.</p><p>So yeah, the time for subtlety has passed. The law isn't working – traumatised children are not calling the police on their mothers, who believe they're doing the best for their daughters. Girls are still being cut. This is the time for noisy statements on prime-time TV. This is what drama is for. And <em>Casualty</em>, with its bright lights and clanking scripts, has timed its action just right. Because it's getting warmer.&nbsp;The summer holidays are close.</p><h2>On the Web</h2><p>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/evawiseman\" title=\"\">guardian.co.uk/profile/evawiseman</a> for all her articles in one place.

They were launched last night as part of a campaign to raise awareness of heart disease and its consequences.</p><p>According to the BHF, someone has a heart attack in Britain every seven minutes, while about 200,000 die of heart disease every year. \"People are taking less exercise and eating more fast food,\" says Kearney. \"There is more obesity as a result, and that in turn means more cases of diabetes, a condition closely linked to heart disease. Hence the simple fact that heart disease remains Britain's number one killer.\" The advert is intended to shock, and raise awareness. People need to understand how to reduce their risks of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>At the same time, more treatments are needed, and Kearney's work is focused on establishing these by trying to armourplate blood vessels so they do not trigger heart attacks in people who are predisposed to cardiovascular illness: \"A heart attack leaves you with a damaged heart and a high risk of suffering heart failure. And heart failure is a scourge today. It causes early mortality, while those who survive are often left severely disabled.\"</p><p>One solution is to try to improve public health and fitness, Kearney said. \"But even if everyone was slim and fit, we would still have lots of cases of heart failure. So we also need to think of new types of medical intervention.\"</p><p>A key approach for Kearney and his team has been to focus on diabetes, which is known to trigger damage to the endothelial cells inside arteries. \"They line arteries, but get stripped away when people get diabetes for reasons that remain unclear.</p><p>\"When this happens, the body assumes the artery has suffered a wound and this stimulates the manufacture of blood clotting factors. A clot forms and that can block the artery and lead to damage of heart muscle and a heart attack.\"</p><p>Kearney is trying to find ways to stop endothelial cells from being stripped from artery walls. \"The body has cells that protect the endothelial lining of arteries. However, in diabetics it has been found that these key defences – endothelial progenitor cells – do not work very well. We need to find ways to improve their function.\"</p><p>Kearney and his team have extracted endothelial progenitor cells from patients, which are then genetically manipulated to boost their performance and increase their expression of different key proteins. Tests on mice found that the function of these progenitor cells was improved. Trials have yet to be carried out on humans, but if these are successful Kearney and his team believe they will be well on the way to developing a technique that could stop the processes that lead to blot clots forming and heart attacks occurring.</p><p>\"Once a person gets diabetes, their cardiovascular system usually begins to deteriorate within a few years,\" said Kearney. \"We are trying to halt this  process and so prevent heart attacks.\" His approach is one of several by scientists trying to deal with the problem.</p><p>Others are working on ways to regenerate blood vessels after they been damaged, for example by a heart attack. \"We need all sorts of approaches. Every day I see the consequences of heart attacks. People, in their sixties, whose hearts are so weakened they cannot walk from one lamp post to the next. And as the population gets older, and diabetes becomes more and more common, more and more people will end up in this condition.\"</p><p>His point is supported by Bronnach Pemberton, who appears in the BHF adverts scheduled to run on TV for the next few weeks. She had a severe heart attack after giving birth to her third child last year, and had to undergo emergency by-pass surgery. She has been left with a severely weakened heart. \"I cannot lift my baby or go for walks,\" she says.</p><p>\"A friend of mine is getting married but it is simply too tiring and too difficult for me to go. I might have survived my heart attack, but I am going through a life sentence.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/heart-attack\">Heart attack</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health & wellbeing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health\">Health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">Television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/advertising\">Advertising</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robinmckie\">Robin McKie</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
