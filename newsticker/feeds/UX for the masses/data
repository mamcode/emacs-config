As someone who has spent most of their UX  career working in-house I thought it be useful to share what I think some of  the key things are for making it as an in-house UXer.</p><h2>Perfect your UX sales patter</h2><p>Ok so you don’t have to suddenly become a salesman once you&#8217;re  working in-house but it is crucial to be able to sell and evangelize UX because  unlike an agency or consultancy you don’t have a sales and marketing team doing  this on your behalf. This means at the very least letting people know that UX  people like yourself exist within the organisation, outlining the sort of work  you do and spelling out why UX is so important to the organisation in the first  place. For tips on selling UX within your organisation take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/selling-ux/\">Selling UX article</a> and  pick up a copy of <a href=\"http://sellingusability.com/\">Selling Usability –  User experience infiltration tactics</a> and <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover  User Experience Design</a>. Both books are stuffed with hints, tips and advice  for how to get those user experience refuseniks within your organisation to  ‘see the light’.</p><h2>Work on your business cases</h2><p>Agencies and consultancies generally don’t have to worry  about writing businesses cases for UX because they’re usually brought on board  once a business case has been put together. It’s a different story if you’re  working in-house as you might need to put a business case together to outline  why UX work should be undertaken for a project. If this is the case try to show  the ROI (return on investment) for UX work and remember that people are not  going to buy in to user experience because it’s the right thing to do, they  will buy in because of what it can deliver to the organisation.</p><h2>Love thy neighbour</h2><div id=\"attachment_1154\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Love-thy-neighbour.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Love-thy-neighbour.jpg\" alt=\" \" title=\"Love-thy-neighbour\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1154\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ahh - look at the cute kitty tenuously illustrating that good working relationships are essential for in-house UXers</p></div><p>Building good internal relationships are key for in-house  UXers because not only will you probably be working with the same people week  in week out, you’ll also want to win allies for the UX crusade within your  organisation.</p><h2>Broaden your UX skill set</h2><p>A lot of agencies and consultancies have specialists for  different UX disciplines, such as user researchers, information architects,  usability testers, interaction designers and content strategists to name but a  few. This is a luxury rarely afforded in-house where it’s often down to you to  carry out the lion share of the UX work for a project (which is a good thing –  variety is the spice of life). This is why it’s important to have a broad UX  skill set, to be a jack of several trades, and a master of some. To find out  more about the sort of skills that I think are important checkout my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/what-makes-good-ux-designer/\">What makes a  good UX designer?</a> article.</p><h2>Increase the UX project mix</h2><p>Working in-house you often don’t the opportunity to work on  the same breadth of projects as you might if working within an agency or  consultancy. A good way to increase the mixture of UX projects you get to work  on is to try to initiate some internal design projects (think <a href=\"http://www.googlelabs.com/\">Google labs</a> if you can swing it) and to  utilise your UX design skills elsewhere with the organisation. For example, you  might make some suggestions for improving the company Intranet or try to get  involved with products where UX design has traditionally not been carried out  (internal systems are perennial examples of this).</p><h2>Keep your UX skills up-to-date</h2><p>It’s perhaps not as easy to be exposed to the latest UX  thinking, techniques, methods, debates and discussions when working within the  in-house company bubble, which is why it’s really important to keep your UX  skills fresh and up-to-date. Make sure that you find the time to read UX books  and blogs (like this one!), attend as many UX events, conferences and training  courses as you can and never pass up the opportunity to connect with fellow  UXers (see below).</p><h2>Connect with fellow UXers</h2><div id=\"attachment_1158\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\" alt=\"An audience at a UX conference\" title=\"UX-conference\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1158\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UX conferences and events are a great way to connect with fellow UXers</p></div><p>It can sometimes be lonely working in-house (cue the violin  music). You might work within a small UX team or even be the sole UXer within  your organisation and so might be starved of like minded company. This is why  it’s important to get out there and connect with fellow UXers as much as  possible. You’ll feel better for sharing ideas, discussing problems that you’re  experiencing and generally talking UX. You could hook up with a local UX group;  join a UX discussion group such as <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/\">UX  exchange</a>; or even persuade your manager to let you attend a UX conference  (you’ll be amazed at where continual nagging can get you). You’ll be surprised  at how much UX related stuff there is out there for you to get involved with.</p><h2>Be realistic about the design process you can undertake</h2><p>For any in-house UX project it’s important to be realistic  about the design process that you can undertake because whilst a design  consultancy such as <a href=\"http://www.cooper.com/\">Cooper</a> might be able  to sell and subsequently follow an extensive UX design process – you’re  unlikely to be able to do this in-house (at least not initially). Often there  simply aren’t the resources, know how or appetite to do this in-house and  you’re only setting yourself up for monumental disappointment if you think that  you’re going to be able to replicate what they do. Try to find a design process  that fits your organisation’s way of doing things and be realistic about how  much UX design work you’re likely to be able to fit in. </p><h2>Focus on delivery, not deliverables</h2><p>To quote Cennydd Bowles and James Box from their excellent <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience Design</a> book, “<em>We believe in delivery, not deliverables.  Some people practice user-scented design, not user-centred design. They churn  out documents – sitemaps, wireframes, specifications – but they’re not  interested in what happens next. UX is a mindset, not a process – it lasts all  the way until the site is live, and after</em>”. A UX designer should be judged  by their designs and delivery, not their deliverables and whilst an agency or consultancy  might feel compelled to produce exquisitely beautiful documents to make their  clients gasp in delight, you hopefully shouldn’t have to. That’s not to say that  your deliverables shouldn’t look professional, but don’t spend any more time on  deliverables than you really have to. Ultimately it’s delivering the right user  experience to the end user that counts.</p><h2>Recognise when to bring in outside help</h2><div id=\"attachment_1159\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\" alt=\"The A-team\" title=\"A-team\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1159\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...Some outside help. Da da daa, da da da</p></div><p>It’s not always possible or indeed desirable to do all UX work  in-house and it’s important to recognise when bringing in some additional UX  resources makes sense. It could be that you need help with the UX workload,  want to bring in a particular specialist or simply because some stakeholders  will respond more favourably to someone from outside the organisation telling  them news they don’t want to hear. Whilst outsourcing some aspects of UX can  certainly make sense be careful with what you outsource. For example, whilst  outsourcing activities such as UX training and usability testing can work quite  well, you really want to keep the core of the UX design work in-house.</p><h2>Create an in-house UX community</h2><p>Even though there might not be too many fellow UXers within  your organisation it doesn’t mean that you can’t create and foster a community  of people who share your interest and passion for user experience. You’ll be  surprised at the number of people that are likely to show an interest in learning  more about user experience, from developers and business analysts to project  managers and technical authors. There are many ways that you can help create  and foster a strong in-house UX community &#8211; here are just a few suggestions to  get you started:</p><ul><li>Set-up regular get togethers to discuss different  aspects of UX.</li><li>Arrange UX knowledgeshares and try to get  external speakers to come in to talk about a particular UX topic.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX blog or newsletter.</li><li>Organise a UX book club.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX mailing list where people  can post UX related questions.</li><li>Organise trips to UX related events and exhibits.</li></ul><h2>Utilise a UX resources library</h2><p>Most agencies and consultancies have the benefit of years of  accumulated UX templates and example deliverables to utilise, so why not set something  similar up within your organisation? If you think that something might be reusable  then stick it in the library because you never know when something might come  in handy for a future project.</p><h2>Don’t stop til you get enough</h2><p>Follow Michael Jackson’s sound advice and “<a href=\"http://www.michaeljackson.com/uk/don039t-stop-039til-you-get-enough-video\">Don’t  stop til you get enough</a>”, enough of whatever your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator\">performance  indicators</a> (a.k.a. KPIs) are that is. Working in-house you should not only  be able to see your designs through to delivery but also should be able to  continue to assess and improve them once they’re out in the real world. To find  out more about the importance of continually improving the UX of your product,  and how you might go about doing this take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/evolutionary-ux-design/\">Evolutionary UX  design article</a>.</p><h2>Don’t give up (good things come to those who wait…)</h2><p>It can often be very frustrating working in-house when there  is a constant push back on carrying out UX work. It can seem like a continual  battle to get UX included on projects – but try not to get too disheartened and  recognise that organisational change happens very slowly (we’re talking light  years in some places). Taking an organisation from UX newbies to old hats takes  an awful lot of time and effort (not to mention blood, sweat and tears) so try  not to give up too early because good things come to those who wait&#8230;</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fin-house-ux%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20make%20it%20as%20an%20in-house%20UXer\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/in-house-ux/feed/") (slash:comments nil "3")) (item nil (title nil "Recommended UX books for aspiring UXers") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-books/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-books/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 22 Aug 2011 08:59:11 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "Usability & user research") (category nil "UX design") (category nil "UX strategy") (category nil "UX tools & techniques") (category nil "Design patterns") (category nil "UX books") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Leaving usability issues to later releases</h2><div id=\"attachment_1077\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bodged-car-repair.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bodged-car-repair.jpg\" alt=\"A car with a bodged wheel repair\" title=\"bodged-car-repair\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1077\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Don&#039;t put off fixing important usability problems</p></div><p>You know in some ways user experience is a lot like DIY  (bear with me here). As any home owner will tell you there are always a million  and one things that need to get fixed and improved around the house, from  dripping taps and scuffed walls to dodgy light sockets and creaky banisters. If  you’re like me you’ll make a big list of stuff that needs doing and then decide  to do it all some other day because you’ve found something much more  interesting to do. Well the same is also true of usability issues. You often have  a bunch of stuff that has been flagged up as causing users problems but somehow  they never get fixed because a fancy new feature is seen as more important, or  there simply isn’t time to get it fixed for the next release. The issue  invariably falls by the way side and gets lost in the mists of time, never to  be resolved (sob). Rather than leaving usability issues to later releases try  to ensure that you test early and often so that you can get them fixed in time,  or even delay a release if the user experience isn’t up to scratch. If an issue  really can’t be fixed in time for the next release then make damn sure that it  makes it in for the next one because as Neil’s (unofficial) first law of  usability issues tells us, the longer you leave a usability issue the less  chance there is of it ever getting resolved.</p><h2>2. Coming to the design <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">battle</span> discussion unprepared</h2><div id=\"attachment_1078\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/playmobile-knight-small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/playmobile-knight-small.jpg\" alt=\"Palymobile knight with shield\" title=\"playmobile-knight-small\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1078\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make sure you come to the design discussion prepared for battle</p></div><p>I’m sure that you’ve been in a few heated design battles,  erm I mean discussions in your time. They usually involve either something  seemingly really minor, like the colour of hyperlinks or something very highly  prized, like real estate on a homepage. Voices usually get raised, people  become very animated and swords are often drawn ready for combat  (metaphorically of course). In such circumstances it’s always worth ensuring  that you’ve come ready for combat, preferably with lots of evidence to back up  your position. This might be in the form of user feedback, analytics data,  research findings or even just a really good reason for why a particular design  is a good idea. People find it much harder to argue against facts, figures and  findings than just opinion and conjecture, so try to bring these to the table  and hopefully you’ll come out of the battle, I mean discussion victorious.</p><h2>3. Failing to explain UX terminology</h2><p>Like most disciplines user experience has its own set of  secret terminology to maintain that all important cloak of mystery. Do you  think your average business person knows precisely what wireframe are? What  about a contextual enquiry or a heuristic evaluation? It can be all too easy to  use UX terms without releasing that people are not going to know what they  mean, or even worse will misinterpret them. For example when you talk about wireframes,  they might think that you’re referring to the finished visual design, so are  going to be a little surprised when you come back with something as colourful  as an old black and white movie. This is why it’s so important to explain UX  terms that are used (or even use terms that people are likely to be familiar  with), to communicate exactly what UX deliverables such as prototypes,  wireframes and personas are and to set expectations upfront. This way you can  keep misunderstandings, not to mention nasty shocks and surprises to a minimum.</p><h2>4. Being overly negative</h2><div id=\"attachment_1079\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Eeyor.gif\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Eeyor.gif\" alt=\"Eeyor\" title=\"Eeyor\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1079\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eeyor the new UX designer struggled to get people to listen to what he had to say</p></div><p>Remember that feeling you got when you received a piece of  school homework that you’d spent ages and ages on only to get a rubbish mark? Pretty  disheartening wasn’t it (and to all those would said ‘no’ – you’re lying). Well  that’s the same feeling that people get when you tell them that the design  they’ve spent ages lovingly crafting sucks (although hopefully not in those  exact words). A great deal of user experience design involves critiquing,  evaluating and testing designs, whether its as part of usability testing,  design critiques or simply delivering your two pennies worth about a quick UI  sketch. It’s therefore no surprise that often UX designers find themselves  delivering bad news. Pointing out problems, potential issues and improvements  is of course vitally important but remember to not be overly negative because  this can sometimes be counter productive. Only delivering bad news can not only  reduce recipients of said news to a sobbing mess but also increase the  likelihood of resistance to your feedback. No one likes hearing only bad news  so also be sure to point out what’s good about the design &#8211; what works well and  what improvements can be made. By outlining what’s good about a design as well  as what’s bad you’re more likely to get buy-in and avoid the reputation for  being the office <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore\">Eeyore</a>.</p><h2>5. Becoming too attached to a design</h2><p>Your team has spent ages working on a radical new design for  an application. Everyone in the team thinks that it’s the bee’s knees, expect  unfortunately the users who where less than forthcoming in their praise during some  usability testing. Do you keep hold of your pride and joy and tell yourself  that those pesky users don’t know what’s good for them, or go back to the  drawing board? In situations like this it can be very difficult to ditch a  design that you’ve spent a lot of time working on (and probably become very  attached to) but often this is precisely what you should do. It’s a mistake  becoming too attached to a design because ultimately you must be able to assess  each design objectively. If user feedback is indicating that a design isn’t  working then don’t be afraid to change it. Of course this is again why getting  early and frequent user feedback is so important and it’s also why coming up  with a number of different designs is such a good idea. Take a leaf out of <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_process.html\">Apple’s  design book</a> and come up with a number of designs which you can then whittle  down to the one that works best. This sort of design <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">Darwinian selection</a> not only leads to the survival of the fittest design but also generally stops  you becoming too attached to a particular design, simply because it’s the only  one you’ve got.</p><h2>6. Buffing and polishing deliverables until they sparkle</h2><p>A good designer (or design team) should be judged on their  design, not their deliverables. Unless you’re sadly not able to see a design  through to delivery and as such your end goal is a set of deliverables (for  example you’ve been brought in just to deliver a design spec) then it’s a  mistake to spend any more time on deliverables than you really have to. Sure  you don’t want documents with lots of typos and wireframes that look like  they’ve been put together by a five year old (although I’ve seen plenty of  wireframes where a five year could have probably done a better job) but  certainly don’t spend more time making your deliverables look good than  actually creating them in the first place. Take a leaf out of Cennydd Bowles  and James Box’s <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience  design manifesto</a> and focus on delivery, not deliverables. Ultimately  deliverables are only a means to an end, it’s the delivery that really counts.</p><h2>7. Starting from scratch</h2><div id=\"attachment_1082\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Boy on bike with a square front wheel\" title=\"square-wheel\" width=\"300\" height=\"343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1082\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The design team questioned whether &#039;starting from scratch&#039; was the right approach</p></div><p>A lot of UX design is about creating stuff. Creating  prototypes, creating documents, creating designs and so on. Whenever you’re  creating something you’ve got to start from somewhere but it’s certainly a  mistake for that somewhere to always be from scratch. Rather than creating a  persona from scratch see if there is a template out there you can use (<a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Agile-persona-templates.zip\">like  this persona template</a>). Rather than creating a set of scenarios from  scratch see if there are some example scenario documents out there you can  borrow the format of. Rather than creating a new design from scratch see if  there are some <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">design  patterns</a> out there you can utilise. Sometimes of course you really do have  to start from scratch, but really this should be the exception rather than the  rule.</p><h2>8. Failing to dot the I’s and cross the T’s</h2><p>When it comes to user experience often the devil is in the  detail. A user’s experience is made up of a thousand tiny details, from a mouse  click here to a piece of text there and if those details are a bit slap dash in  parts they will eventually build up to one crappy overall user experience. This  is why it’ so important to make sure that all those tiny details are as  intended and as they should be. That copy doesn’t contain any typos or spelling  mistakes. That text casing is consistent. That elements are properly aligned  and so on. Don’t think that you can rest easy because everything will be picked  up by the test team, or perhaps the development team because their focus is  usually on the functional side of things, not the UX side of things. Ultimately  the design team should be responsible for the UX design, therefore poor  attention to detail not only reflects badly on a website or application but  also the design team behind that website or application.</p><h2>9. Letting information about users slip through the cracks</h2><p>How much information do you have available about your users?  Probably more than you think. There’s the customer satisfaction survey that was  run last year that you weren’t aware of. There’s the persona research that was  undertaken for a different project. There’s the report from a usability testing  consultancy that’s gathering dust somewhere (you get the idea). Often user  research, usability testing and UX design work is carried out by different  teams within an organisation, or even farmed out to different suppliers so it’s  no surprise that the information can become very fragmented. Often really  valuable information about users gets lost in the ether because teams don’t  talk to one another, don’t organise their user information or simply don’t  bother to retain it from project to project. This is why it’s such a good idea  to have regular discussions between teams and to have a place where information  about users can be shared, stored and discussed (such as a <a href=\"http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/\">Sharepoint</a> or <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">Basecamp</a> site).</p><h2>10. Over analysing every design decision</h2><p>There’s a now infamous story from <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/\">Douglas Bowman</a> about <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html\">Google  testing 41 different shades of blue</a> to see which one performs best for a  particular design. Now this surely takes over analysing every design decision  to the extreme but don’t make the same mistake of using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing\">user testing</a> as the  only means of making a design decision. Sure it’s great to get some feedback  for a design but often you just have to make a call and go with you’re UX  design gut instinct – and if that fails you can always <a href=\"http://8ball.tridelphia.net/\">ask the magic eight ball</a>.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/\">10 UX  mistakes to avoid (UX for the Masses)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fmore-ux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=Another%2010%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_6\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/more-ux-mistakes/feed/") (slash:comments nil "3")) (item nil (title nil "10 UX mistakes to avoid") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 08 Jul 2011 15:54:49 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "UX design") (category nil "UX strategy") (category nil "Mistakes") (category nil "Myths") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Leaving it too late to get UX onboard</h2><div id=\"attachment_1051\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tree-in-front-of-house.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Tree-in-front-of-house.jpg\" alt=\"Tree in front of a house\" title=\"Tree-in-front-of-house\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1051\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">What can happen when design isn&#039;t considered from the start...</p></div><p>Arrr! Customer feedback has  come back saying that the new design is too damn difficult to use, quick get  the UX guys and girls on the case to sort it out. Sound familiar? UX designers  are often parachuted into a project at the last minute in an attempt to sort  out a dog’s dinner of a UI. Unfortunately by this time it’s usually too late to do much and certain too late to get the full benefits of UX design. The <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/roi.html\">ROI (return on investment) for  usability and UX</a> is generally greater the earlier it’s spent on a project.  Ideally that means getting UX onboard from the very start to undertake such  activities as:</p><ul><li>Investigating user requirements and carrying out  user research.</li><li>Gathering user insights and generating design  ideas based on these.</li><li>Testing and gathering feedback for any existing systems.</li><li>Validating requirements and testing possible  designs before they are actually built.</li></ul><h2>2. Assuming that other people give a damn about UX, or even know what it is</h2><p>I’m assuming that because you’re reading this article you hopefully  already know a thing or two about UX and usability (or soon will!). You also  hopefully care about delivering a good user experience to your users. Well sadly  not everyone knows what UX is and certainly not everyone gives a damn about it.  Of course people care about their users (at least I hope they do) and the  experience they deliver to them but don’t forget that UX design is a means to  an end, not the end itself. People shouldn’t need to care about the process but  they should care about the results. This is why it’s so important to sell the  benefits of UX design and to educate people so that they know what UX design  involves, what the outputs are and why it’s so important. There are loads of  good ways to <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/selling-ux/\">sell UX</a> and to educate and evangelize, from knowledge shares and presentations to  blogs, case studies and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFoz6FGvHo\">introductory  videos</a>.</p><h2>3. Leaving it to the last minute to get user feedback</h2><div id=\"attachment_1052\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/user-head-in-hands.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/user-head-in-hands.jpg\" alt=\"User with their head in their hands\" title=\"user-head-in-hands\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1052\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arrr... Why didn&#039;t we test this design with users earlier?</p></div><p>User feedback can sometimes feel a little bit like revision  for a big exam. You know that you should be doing it as early and as often as  possible, but somehow you end up cramming the night before, when really it’s  too late to make a lot of difference. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that  you have to wait for a working version of a design to get user feedback when <a href=\"http://www.paperprototyping.com/\">paper prototyping</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/\">rapid prototyping</a> allows you to test a design long before it’s built.</p><h2>4. Spreading the UX sauce too thinly</h2><p>If like me you work as part of an internal UX team you’ll  probably find that there are a million and one websites and applications that  are in urgent need of a bit of UX TLC (tender loving care). The temptation is  to try and improve as many as possible but this can often be a mistake as all  you end up doing is spreading your resources too thinly and ultimately making  little impact across a multitude of websites and applications. Instead it’s  better to be a bit more selective and to focus your efforts on those websites  and applications that must deliver a really good user experience in order to  succeed. This allows you to make the most of your limited UX resources and to  hopefully get the biggest bang for your UX buck.</p><h2>5. Creating a UX fiefdom</h2><div id=\"attachment_1053\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/castle-small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/castle-small.jpg\" alt=\"Castle\" title=\"castle\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1053\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The internal UX team went a step too far to protect their fiefdom</p></div><p>For those unfamiliar with the term a fiefdom is, &quot;something  over which one dominant person or group exercises control&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fiefdom\">The free dictionary</a>).  Sometimes internal UX teams can create their own UX fiefdom because they refuse  to let go of any UX design work and crush any attempts to open it up outside of  the group. Of course having a group over seeing UX design to make sure that it’s  done properly makes a lot of sense, but UX design should be something that’s  open to all, not just a select few. There’s no reason for example why someone  with a bit of assistance and know how can’t carry out activities such as  usability testing, expert evaluations, user interviews and UI design to name  but a few. Opening up UX design to the masses (see what I’ve done!) not only  prevents a fiefdom from forming but also allows the UX experts to better  utilise their own time, so really it’s a win win situation!</p><h2>6. Having separate UX researchers and designers</h2><p>A lot of organisations have separate UX research and design  teams, or might send the research and design components of a project out to  different suppliers. On one hand this makes a lot of sense because you obviously  want those people skilled in research carrying out the research and those  skilled in design carrying out the design. However I think that often doing  this means that a lot of the important research insight can get lost in  translation as one team communicates findings to the other. Research also  shouldn’t be carried out for its own sake and it’s important that any design research  is able to feed into and influence the ultimate design. This is why I would  advocate having the same team carrying out both the UX research and design. Of  course within that team you might have research and design specialists but you  want the continuity and know how that having the same team involved throughout  can bring.</p><h2>7. Jumping straight into design</h2><p>When considering a new product or website, or thinking about  how an existing one can be improved it can be very tempting to start designing  straight away. &quot;This is how this screen might work&quot;. &quot;This is what we should  have on the homepage&quot;. Whist it makes sense to certainly start thinking about  the design from the start it can be a mistake to jump in too early without  first considering the bigger picture and hopefully carrying out a bit of  research first. It might turn out for example that a feature you’ve spent  considerable time designing isn’t in tune with how users want to work, or even  worse might not even be required in the first place!</p><h2>8. Creating overly elaborate prototypes and wireframes</h2><p>With increasingly powerful rapid prototyping and wireframing  tools out there, such as <a href=\"http://www.axure.com/\">Axure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/\">Omnigraffle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/SketchFlow_Overview.aspx\">Microsoft  Sketchflow</a> it can be tempting to spend lots of time on an elaborate pixel  perfect (or close to) version of a prototype (or set of wireframes), getting it  really slick and modelling more and more of the intended interactions. This can  often be a mistake because you end up spending too much time and effort on a  prototype that is only going to be thrown away anyway. Unless the prototype  will become the production system (which I think is generally a bad idea  anyway) or it really needs to model every interaction in excruciating detail  (i.e. it’s bound for the off shore sausage factory) then don’t spend any more  time than is necessary on a prototype. Don’t forget that a prototype is only a  means to an end, not the end itself so think twice about exactly how much  detail and how polished it really needs and produce something that is <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/good-enough-design/\">good enough, but no  better</a>.</p><h2>9. Blindly copying other designs</h2><div id=\"attachment_1054\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\" alt=\"iPod rip off\" title=\"ipod-rip-off\" width=\"200\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1054\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Be wary of simply ripping off another design</p></div><p>An all too common UX mistake is to copy another design,  assuming that a great deal of thought, research and testing has gone into it.  Well of course this might have been the case, but usually it isn’t. By blinding  copying another design you might also be copying the same issues, problems and  short falls in that design. Whilst of course it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">utilise design  patterns</a> and to borrow the best bits from other designs you need to think  long and hard about how that design might perform and ideally put it to the  test. Something like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B  testing</a> is a great way to do this, or simply run the design by  some users and see how it fares.</p><h2>10. Not setting any UX standards and guidelines</h2><p>In the same way that it’s important to have building  standards in place to ensure that a building is built and maintained correctly,  it’s also a good idea to have UX standards and guidelines in place to ensure  that good UX design principles and practices are followed. Without these it’s all  too easy for <a href=\"http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/\">bad UX design</a> to  proliferate and for lots of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-design-consistency/\">inconsistencies to  creep into designs</a>. Of course having UX standards and guidelines that are overly  prescriptive or too exhaustive is also a mistake but it certainly makes sense  to have standards and guidelines that cover areas such as the design process to  follow (or at least loosely follow), design patterns to use, design principles  to adhere to and user feedback loops to incorporate.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://boltpeters.com/blog/ten-ux-mistakes/\">Top Ten UX Mistakes on  Consumer Websites (Bolt | Peters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://tibetantailor.com/?p=1027\">The  Top Ten Mistakes UX (User Experience) Leaders Make (TibetanTailor)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html\">Top  10 Mistakes in Web Design (Jakob Nielsen)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/01/09/user-experience-design/\">10 most common  misconceptions about user experience design (Whitney Hess)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=10%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0")) (item nil (title nil "Say it with a word cloud") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/word-clouds/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/word-clouds/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 06 Jun 2011 15:52:07 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "Usability & user research") (category nil "UX tools & techniques") (category nil "Analytics") (category nil "Surveys") (category nil "User research") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Usually that shape is a cloud, although plenty of word  cloud generators such as <a href=\"http://www.tagxedo.com/\">Tagxedo</a> now let  you choose different shapes (like a square, love heart or even <a href=\"http://www.tagxedo.com/app.html?player=http://www.tagxedo.com/gallery/lincoln.xap\">Abraham Lincon!</a>). The frequency (or importance) of each word or phrase within the text is usually shown by its  size. The more a word or phrase occurs in the text, the larger it  will be within the word cloud. For instance, the word cloud below was generated  using <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\">Wordle</a> by examining the text for all  UX for the masses articles. You can see that words such as ‘usability’, ‘users’  and ‘website’ crop up quite a lot.</p><div id=\"attachment_960\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-all-text-word-cloud.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-all-text-word-cloud.png\" alt=\"Word cloud\" width=\"728\" height=\"283\" class=\"size-full wp-image-960\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Word cloud showing all text for this website (created using Wordle)</p></div><h2>How do I create word clouds?</h2><p>Creating word clouds is ridiculously easy as there are loads of <a href=\"http://21centuryedtech.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/waiting-for-wordle-free-word-cloud-options-to-use-now/\">good word cloud generators</a> out there. Two that I can certainly recommend are <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\">Wordle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tagxedo.com/\">Tagxedo</a>. Both allow you to copy and paste in  text to create a word cloud, or to use an RSS feed. One thing to be mindful of  is that in order to retain phrases, such as ‘UX design’ you generally need to  replace spaces with the tilde symbol (‘~’). For example ‘UX for the masses’  would need to be input as ‘UX~for~the~masses’. </p><p>To make things a bit easier I’ve created a useful Excel spreadsheet  that spits out the text for creating word clouds. All you have to do is enter  (or paste in) a list of words / phrases with a corresponding weight (e.g.  number of instances, % of instances, level of importance etc…). For example: </p><table><tr><td width=\"200px\"><strong>Words / phrases</strong></td><td><strong>Weighting / Instances</strong></td></tr><tr><td>UX design</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>Usability</td><td >150</td></tr><tr><td>User research</td><td>67</td></tr></table><p>The spreadsheet will insert tilde symbols (‘~’) to preserve  phrases and will output the right number of words / phrases to match the  weightings. There is also a worksheet for utilising the <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/advanced\">advanced Wordle features</a> that allow  you to specify the colour for individual words and phrases (for the more  hardcore word clouders out there).
</p><p>If the word cloud generator doesn’t  allow you to export the results as an image (shame on you <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\">Wordle</a>)  then you can simply screen grab the results using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.wisdom-soft.com/products/screenhunter.htm\">ScreenHunter</a>,  or save it as a PDF using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.cutepdf.com/\">CutePDF</a>.</p><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"winzip-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Word-cloud-text-generator.zip\">Download word cloud text generator (ZIP, 1.51Mb)</a></li></ul><h2>Suggestions for using word clouds</h2><p>Here are some of the ways in which I’ve used word clouds in  the past.</p><h3>To show analytics information</h3><p>Word clouds are great for showing analytics information and  because you can usually export analytics reports to a CSV file it’s dead easy  to plug the terms straight into the word cloud text generator.</p><p>The sort of analytics information  that might be shown as a word cloud includes:</p><ul><li>Inbound searches (i.e. search engine searches  that lead into a website).</li><li>Internal searches (i.e. searches within a  website).</li><li>Most popular content.</li><li>Most popular entry and exit pages.</li><li>Visitor information (e.g. country of origin).</li></ul><p>As an example of the sort of thing you can do the word cloud  below shows the most popular Google searches that have resulted in visitors  coming to this website.</p><div id=\"attachment_965\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-inbound-search-word-cloud.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-inbound-search-word-cloud.png\" alt=\"Word cloud\" width=\"728\" height=\"233\" class=\"size-full wp-image-965\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most popular inbound Google searches for this website (word cloud generated using Wordle)</p></div><h3>To show user feedback</h3><p>Word clouds are great for showing user feedback, such as  survey and interview results (assuming a good sample size, such as more than 20 participants). The sort of user feedback that might be communicated using word  clouds includes:</p><ul><li>Likes and dislikes for a product.</li><li>Common issues with a product.</li><li>Reasons for coming to a website.</li><li>Chosen product descriptors (e.g. frustrating,  professional, convenient) as captured using something like <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Miscrosoft-Product-Reaction-Cards.doc\">Microsoft’s  product reaction cards (Word)</a>. </li></ul><h3>To show product usage information</h3><p>Word clouds can also be used to show product usage  information, such as how often features are used, or how popular content is on  a website. For instance the word cloud below shows the various articles on this  website by popularity (determined by number of views). </p><div id=\"attachment_971\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-articles-word-cloud.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-articles-word-cloud.png\" alt=\"word cloud\" width=\"728\" height=\"727\" class=\"size-full wp-image-971\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Articles on this website by number of views (word cloud generated using Tagxedo)</p></div><h3>To show user information</h3><p>Why not show information about users or their <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/personas/\">personas</a> using word clouds? The  sort of user information you could show includes:</p><ul><li>The different types of users (the larger the  text, the bigger the overall proportion of this user group).</li><li>Demographics information (e.g. country,  language, occupational groups etc&#8230;).</li><li>User needs and requirements (e.g. simplicity, reliability,  speed, flexibility, easy to use etc…).</li></ul><p>For instance, the word cloud below shows which countries visitors to this website have come from.</p><div id=\"attachment_973\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-countries-word-cloud.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uxm-countries-word-cloud.png\" alt=\"Word cloud\" width=\"728\" height=\"233\" class=\"size-full wp-image-973\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The country of origin for visitors to this website (word  cloud generated using Wordle)</p></div><h3>To show user stories</h3><p>If you’re utilising <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story\">user stories</a> then you could  even show them as a word cloud. The larger the user story, the more important  it is to users. For example, the word cloud below shows some possible user  stories for an ecommerce website.</p><div id=\"attachment_974\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/user-stories-word-cloud.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/user-stories-word-cloud.png\" alt=\"Word cloud\" width=\"728\" height=\"243\" class=\"size-full wp-image-974\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Possible user stories for an ecommerce website (word cloud  generated using Wordle)</p></div><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://21centuryedtech.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/waiting-for-wordle-free-word-cloud-options-to-use-now/\">Welcome  Back Wordle… Plus 7 Other Free Word Cloud Generators!

In this article I outline some  hints, tips and best practice guidelines for improving the usability (and resulting  conversion rate) of your forms.</p><h2>Form design</h2><h3>Keep forms as short and simple as possible</h3><p>A good rule of thumb when it comes to form design is to try  to keep your forms as short and simple as possible, but no simpler. Try to  remove any unnecessary questions and try to simplify complex questions as much  as possible. A good way to do this is to run through the form and ask yourself,  “Do we really need to capture this information?”. If the answer is ‘probably  not’ then resolve to remove that item from the form.</p><h3>Don’t make users think any more than they have to</h3><p>Ask me the month and year I bought my last car and I could  probably tell you. Ask me the exact date and I wouldn’t have a clue. Try not to  make users think any more than they have to when filling out your form by  ensuring that questions are clear, unambiguous and as easy to answer as  possible (unless of course you’re designing a quiz). For each step of the form  ask yourself “Is it clear what users need to do and will they be able to do  it?”. If the answer is no then you’ll need to change that part of the form.</p><h3>Make forms as standard as possible</h3><p>Your users will have filled out countless forms prior to yours  so it makes sense to try to make your form as standard as possible. This means  using existing form design patterns, such as a recognised address format, postcode  look up and error reporting (checkout my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">design patterns  search</a> for an easy way to find form design patterns). Designing a form that  is unlike any other might make for a very interesting design but is likely to  leave your users scratching their heads.</p><h3>Let users know what to expect</h3><p>For many forms it’s important to let users know what is in  store for them, such as how long the form is likely to take and what sort of  information they will need to hand. After all, you don’t want users getting  half way through your form only to realise that they don’t have all the  information that’s required.</p><h2>Form layout</h2><h3>Break complex forms up into bite size chunks</h3><p>For more complex forms it’s often a mistake to try to do too  much on the one page, or the one form. Instead consider breaking up the form  into bit size chunks, much in the same way that most online checkouts are  broken down in to steps (delivery address, billing address, payment etc…). Make  sure that sections are clearly labelled and that related information, such as  delivery details are captured together. </p><h3>Show the user’s progress</h3><p>For longer forms it’s important to let users know where they  are in the form and how much further they have to go. This might be as simple  as outlining the step they are currently on (e.g. step 1 of 4), displaying the  percentage complete or displaying a progress bar showing the steps completed  and the steps still to go.</p><h3>Make forms easier to scan</h3><p>Make your form easy for users to quickly scan by using white  space, headers and other graphical elements to clearly differentiate form  sections. Headings should be descriptive, succinct and should stand out on the  page so that users can quickly see what information they need to enter. </p><h3>Utilise progressive disclosure</h3><p>For complex forms it can be confusing and potentially  overwhelming for users to show all the inputs straight away. Instead it’s a  good idea to progressively disclose form elements so that they are revealed  only if and when required and within context. For example, if a drop down has  an ‘other’ option which requires entry into a text field, it’s a good idea to  only show that text field when ‘other’ has been selected.<strong></strong></p><h2>Labels</h2><h3>Use the user’s terms and names</h3><p>It’s important when considering labels that names and terms  are used that users will understand and recognise. Try to avoid using your own  terms as something that might make sense to you might not make sense to your  users.</p><h3>Use succinct and descriptive labels</h3><p>Form labels should be short, clear and descriptive. If extra  information, clarification or context is required use help text to do this  rather than long rambling labels.</p><h3>Place labels next to inputs</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php\">Eye  tracking studies</a> have shown that placing labels next to inputs (e.g. above or to the left &#8211; i.e. right aligned) make it easiest for users to read and  associate labels with fields (taking advantage of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology\">Gestalt law of proximity</a>).</p><h3>Distinguish required and optional inputs</h3><p>It’s important to distinguish the required inputs on a form  so that users know what information that they must enter. The standard  convention is to use a ‘*’ to distinguish required fields. For example, ‘Name  *’. Don’t forget to also include text at the top of each form page stating that  the asterisk signifies a required field. </p><p>  If most of the fields on a form  are required with just 1 or 2 optional then it often makes more sense to  highlight optional fields, rather than required fields. A good way to do this  is to append the labels for optional inputs with ‘(optional)’, such as ‘Mobile  number (optional)’. Short forms, such as a password reset form might have all  fields required, in which case it’s usually not necessary to highlight required  fields.</p><h2>Inputs</h2><h3>Use appropriate inputs</h3><p>It’s important to choose the right sort of input for the  information being captured. For example, radio buttons are a good idea where a  small number (e.g. 2-6) of mutually exclusive options are available (i.e. only  one can be selected), whereas a dropdown is more appropriate where a larger  number of options are available (or where space is an issue). The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511482.aspx\">Microsoft Windows  UX guide</a> has a really good run down of many of the different input controls  available and their appropriate usage.</p><p>The length of text fields should also reflect the format and  expected length of text input. Short inputs such as postcodes should have a  short text box, where as longer inputs, such as email addresses should have a  larger text box. A good way to test that appropriate sizes have been used is to  go through your form entering some expected values. Text boxes should be large  enough to show most if not all of the text entered.</p><h3>Have a logical order of inputs</h3><p>Your form should have a logical order of entry. It would be  most unusual for example to ask users for their address and then their name, as  it’s usually the other way around. It’s also a good idea to group related  inputs so that users are entering related information in the one place. For  example, you might group contact information together (name, email address,  telephone number etc…) or preferences together. For larger forms inputs might  be grouped into clear sections with headings.</p><h3>Use smart defaults where appropriate</h3><p>Smart defaults simply mean that inputs are set to a sensible initial value so that a significant proportion of your users don’t have to do anything. For  example, if most of your users come from the UK and you have a country select dropdown, it might be a good idea to default the country to ‘UK’ (or at least  have it at the top of the dropdown).</p><p>Smart defaults can be really useful but be mindful of users  inadvertently submitting default values because they don&#8217;t realise that a  value has already been selected.</p><h3>Consider the order and grouping of options</h3><p>Where multiple options are available for users it’s  important to consider the best order in which to list them and whether grouping  options would make sense. For shorter lists it’s usually best to order by  estimated popularity, with the most likely to be chosen option first and so on.  Longer lists (e.g. country select) are usually best ordered alphabetically or  grouped, for example using the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/H85.html\">OPTGROUP  element to group options within a dropdown</a>.</p><h3>Be flexible about formatting</h3><p>Try not to be too picky about how users enter information  into your form as there is nothing more annoying than a form that requires  information to be entered in a very specific format. For example, if you’re  asking for a date the form should ideally be able to accept both shorthand  (e.g. 11/5/11 – in the UK, 5/11/11 in the US) and long hand versions (e.g.  11/5/2011 – in the UK, 5/11/2011 in the US). </p><h3>Allow users to tab through inputs</h3><p>Many users will utilise the Tab key to move between inputs  on a form as it can be much quicker than moving the cursor to the next input  with the mouse. It’s therefore a good idea to check that tabbing between inputs  is possible for your form and that inputs are tabbed in a logical order. The <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_tabindex.asp\">TABINDEX element</a> can be used to specify tabbing order within a web form if the default order  is all over the place.</p><h2>Help</h2><h3>Address common user queries and questions</h3><p>Users are bound to have lots of queries and questions when  it comes to filling out your form. What does this refer to? Why am I being  asked for this information? Hopefully you’ve captured some of these during <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-testing/\">usability testing</a> but even if you’ve not yet carried out any usability testing you can still probably  have a good guess at some of the queries that might crop up.</p><p>  A good way to address common user  queries and question is to show some help text when an input has focus. You  won’t need to include help text for every input, just those where users might  need a little help or clarification. Help text should be short and clear. If a  user might need extra help then it’s usually better to link to more  information, or to include some additional FAQs, rather than overload the form  with help text. <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/\">MoneySupermarket.com’s</a> car insurance quote form (as shown below) is a really good example of  addressing common user queries using on focus help text and FAQs.</p><div id=\"attachment_932\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/moneysupermarket-form-example.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/moneysupermarket-form-example.png\" alt=\"Moneysupermarket form example\" title=\"Moneysupermarket form example\" width=\"728\" height=\"465\" class=\"size-full wp-image-932\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moneysupermarket.com  addresses common user queries and questions for it’s car insurance  quote form by using on focus help and FAQs.</p></div><h3>Keep help text succinct and easy to understand</h3><p>Whenever writing help text for a form it’s important to  keep it as succinct and as easy to understand as possible. After all, users won’t  want to have to read an essay to work out how to fill out your form. Help text  should be written in <a href=\"http://www.plainlanguage.gov/whatisPL/index.cfm\">plain English</a>,  avoiding the use of jargon and gobbledygook (love that word). Terms used should obviously also be ones that users will understand.</p><h2>Errors</h2><h3>Highlight all errors</h3><p>If there are errors on the form following an attempted  submission then these should all be reported, ideally with each input at fault  also individually highlighted. A good way to do this is to show error messages  at the top of the page listing all the errors and then show additional error  messages above or below the inputs at fault. It’s important not to just report  the first input with an error because there might be others that need fixing  and you will want your users to hopefully fix all their errors  before re-submitting the form.</p><h3>Use clear, actionable error messages </h3><p>Error messages should be clear and actionable. For example,  don’t just report that there is some information missing, state what that  information is. Similarly don’t just report that an input is not in the correct  format, outline what the format should be. It’s important that users not only  know why an error has been reported but also how they can fix it. </p><h3>Utilise real-time validation</h3><p>For some inputs it can be a good idea to utilise real-time  validation, perhaps using JavaScript or AJAX to validate inputs prior to  submission. For example you might check that an input is in the correct format,  that a user name has not already been used or that two email addresses entered  are exactly the same.</p><h2>Actions</h2><h3>Make primary call to actions clear</h3><p>Primary calls to action on the form, such ‘Next’ or ‘Submit’  should be clear and should ideally stand out on the page. A good way to do this  is to make the primary action a button and other actions, such as ‘Back’ or  ‘Cancel’ links. Alternatively you could use a different colour or visual  styling for the primary call to action button.</p><h3>Provide feedback to users</h3><p>It’s important to provide users with feedback following an  action. For example, you should provide feedback following submission of the  form or during some sort of lookup. For operations that can take a little while  the now ubiquitous swirling circle is a good way to show that something is  happening, or alternatively showing a progress bar or percentage complete. Let  users know whether their action was successful or not and what their next steps  are. If their action was unsuccessful don’t forget to outline why this was and  what the user can do about it.</p><h3>Make reusable and very complex forms saveable</h3><p>It’s a really good idea to make very complex or very long forms,  such as job application forms saveable, so that users can save their progress  (or have it automatically saved for them) and return to their form at a later  date. The same also applies to reusable forms. These are forms where users are  likely to need to retrieve, edit and resubmit their form at some point in the  future. Insurance quote forms are a good example of reusable forms.</p><h3>Avoid including a reset button (unless having one makes sense) </h3><p>You still see an awful lot of reset / clear buttons on web  forms these days, usually tantalisingly close to the ‘Submit’ button so that a  user can easily inadvertently clear their form rather than submitting it. Unless  users are likely to need to be able to reset their entire form, such as for  search filter or advanced search forms resist the temptation to include a reset  button &#8211; 9 times of out 10 it’s a potential hindrance rather than being  helpful.</p><h2>Other considerations</h2><h3>Make forms accessible</h3><p>Making sure that your form is as accessible as possible is a  no-brainer because it opens it up to the largest audience possible. Usability  and accessibility also go hand in hand as usually the more accessible a form  is, the more usable it is as well. I’ve listed some useful articles for making  forms accessible in the related articles section as making forms accessible is  a substantial topic in its own right.</p><h3>Carry out usability testing</h3><p>As they say the proof is in the pudding – how can you tell  how usable a form is without testing it with real users? Ideally you should be  carrying out <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-testing/\">moderated  usability testing</a>, either face-to-face or remotely using a screen sharing  tool (checkout my list of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/free-ux-tools/\">25  great free UX tools</a> for a few free ones you could use). If getting time  with users is likely to be very difficult then you could also carry out unmoderated  remote usability testing using a tool using as <a href=\"http://www.loop11.com/\">Loop11</a> (take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/presentations/\">remote  user testing 101 presentation</a> for more about remote usability testing).</p><p>You don’t even need a working form to carry out usability  testing. You could carry out some early <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/sketching/\">paper prototyping</a> to test  out sketches or rudimentary mock-ups of your form, or put together a <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/\">rapid prototype</a> using one of the many rapid prototyping tools out there.</p><h3>Set-up and track form analytics</h3><p>Once a form is actually being used in the big bad world you’ll  want to see how users are fairing and whether it’s performing as expected.

In next to no time you can whip something  up using one of the many online survey tools out there (I particularly  recommend <a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/\">SurveyGizmo</a>) and start  gathering feedback from real users. Often implementing the survey is the easy  bit, it’s designing the thing that’s the tricky part as you won’t get the  feedback you’re after if you don’t ask the right questions. In this article I  outline 15 useful user feedback questions for online surveys for you to pick and choose  from.</p><h3>1. Would you recommend &lt;website / product&gt; to a friend? </h3><p>This is a great way to find out what users’ opinion of a  website or product is. After all, someone is unlikely to recommend something  that they don’t rate themselves. Rather than just capturing a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’  response consider providing ‘<strong>Yes, I’d  recommend it because…</strong>’ and ‘<strong>No, I  wouldn’t recommend it because…</strong>’ as possible answers with text boxes below  each (or show the relevant text box on answer) so that you can also find out  why users would or would not recommend it.</p><h3>2. How would you describe &lt;website / product&gt; in one or more words?</h3><p>This is a good question for capturing perceptions of a website  or product. You could allow users to enter their own words or chose one or more  from a list, such as the 118 used in <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Miscrosoft-Product-Reaction-Cards.doc\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft’s  product reaction cards (Word)</a>. A good way to analyse the results of  this question is to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud\">word  cloud</a> generated using a service such as <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\">Wordle</a>.</p><h3>3. If &lt;website / product&gt; were a car, what car would it be?</h3><p>A bit of a wacky one but by asking users to compare your  website or product to something else you can investigate their perceptions of  it. For example, do they compare it to a beautiful and desirable <a href=\"http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecars/db9\">Aston Martin DB9</a> or a  bland and boring <a href=\"http://www.toyota.com/corolla/\">Toyota Corolla</a> (sorry Corolla drivers out there)?</p><h3>4. How does &lt;website / product&gt; compare to &lt;competitor&gt;?</h3><p>A great way to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of a  website or product is to ask users to compare it to something similar that they  have used. In addition to asking how the two compare you might also ask ‘<strong>Which do you prefer?</strong>’ to find out more  definitively how your website or product stacks up to the competition.</p><h3>5. If you were to review &lt;website / product&gt; what score would you  give it out of 10?</h3><p>With most online shoppers being familiar with customer  reviews and ratings why not ask users to review your website or product? You  could ask for an overall rating or ask them to rate specific areas. I prefer to  use a 10 point score rather than 5 point because it gives participants more  flexibility. It’s also a good idea to ask ‘<strong>Why  have you given this score?</strong>’ so that you find out the rationale for a  rating.</p><h3>6. What do you find most frustrating about &lt;website / product&gt;?</h3><p>A lot of websites and products focus on pilling on more and  more features, rather than ensuring that existing features work really well.  Asking what currently frustrates users is a great way to investigate how  existing features can be improved. You can ask what users find most frustrating  or alternatively ask for their top 3 frustrations.</p><h3>7. Overall, how easy to use do you find &lt;website / product&gt;? </h3><p>Standard usability questionnaires such as <a href=\"http://oldwww.acm.org/perlman/question.cgi\">CSUQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SUS-System-Usability-Scale.doc\" target=\"_blank\">SUS</a> and <a href=\"http://lap.umd.edu/quis/\">QUIS</a> are really good for evaluating the  usability of a website or product but can be quite lengthy. This is a good  single question for investigating the usability of a product or service.  Possible answers could be ‘Very easy to use’; ‘Easy to use’; ‘Neither easy nor  difficult to use’; ‘Difficult to use’ and ‘Very difficult to use’. Also  consider asking ‘<strong>Why is this?</strong>’ if a  user selects either ‘Difficult to use’ or ‘Very difficult to use’ so that you  can investigate the reasons behind this a little further.</p><h3>8. Why have you come to &lt;website&gt;?</h3><p>Even with analytics it can be difficult to work out what users  are coming to your website for. Is it to find out some information; to carry  out a transaction or something you’ve not even considered? In addition to  asking why users have come to your website you might also want to ask ‘<strong>Were you successful?</strong>’ and ‘<strong>What problems did you experience</strong>’. This  allows you to also investigate how well the website supported someone’s goal or  task.<strong></strong></p><h3>9. If you could change one thing about &lt;website / product&gt; what would  it be and why?</h3><p>This is a great question for unearthing major frustrations  or feature omissions. Asking for one thing forces users to consider what is  most important to them. You could alternatively ask for up to three things that  someone would like to change.</p><h3>10. What features could you not live without?</h3><p>This is a good question for investigating killer features.  Analytics will often tell you which features are most popular but not  necessarily which are most important to users. </p><h3>11. What do you like best about &lt;website / product&gt;? </h3><p>Along with finding out what needs to be improved about a  website or product, don’t forget to also find out what currently works really  well. After all, you don’t want to inadvertently change something that users  currently really like.</p><h3>12. What do you like least about &lt;website / product&gt;?</h3><p>A good complement to asking what users like best about a  website or product. For this question you could either ask what users like or alternatively  ask for their top 3 dislikes.</p><h3>13. Which features could you live without?</h3><p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/\">37signals</a> in their  rather splendid book <a href=\"http://gettingreal.37signals.com/\">Getting Real</a> (which incidentally can be read online for free – whoopee) state that when it  comes to feature selection, “<em>More isn&#8217;t the  answer. Sometimes the biggest favour you can do for customers is to leave  something out</em>”. I couldn’t’ agree more which is why it can be a really good  idea to find out which features might be pruned from your website or product.</p><h3>14. How can we improve &lt;website / product&gt;? Send us your ideas and  suggestions.</h3><p>This is a great question for getting general user feedback, together  with feature ideas and suggestions. You might even want to think about setting  up a follow up customer feedback forum, using a service such as <a href=\"http://uservoice.com/\">Uservoice</a>. This allows users to vote on ideas  and suggestions that have been submitted so hopefully you can find out which is  likely to be most popular.</p><h3>15. Anything else you care to share or get off your chest?</h3><p>This is a great last question as it gives users the  opportunity to sound off about anything the survey may have missed and makes it  clear that you’re interested in listening to them (just don’t take any rants  too personally).</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/04/the-three-greatest-survey-questions-ever.html\">The  Three Greatest Survey Questions Ever (Avinash Kaushik)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~tomtullis/publications/UPA2004TullisStetson.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A  Comparison of Questionnaires for Assessing Website Usability (PDF)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lap.umd.edu/quis/\">QUIS &#8211; Questionnaire for User Interaction  Satisfaction</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SUS-System-Usability-Scale.doc\" target=\"_blank\">SUS –  System Usability Scale (Word)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://oldwww.acm.org/perlman/question.cgi\">CSUQ &#8211; Computer System  Usability Questionnaire</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fonline-survey-questions%2F&amp;title=15%20useful%20user%20feedback%20questions%20for%20online%20surveys\" id=\"wpa2a_14\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/online-survey-questions/feed/") (slash:comments nil "4")) (item nil (title nil "25 great free UX tools") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/free-ux-tools/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/free-ux-tools/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 10:02:38 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "UX tools & techniques") (category nil "Prototyping") (category nil "sitemapping") (category nil "usability testing") (category nil "UX software") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Well I won’t deny that it helps (spoken like a true expert!) but since user experience certainly isn’t rocket science anyone can have a good stab at carrying out a usability review and learn a great deal in the process. In this article I walkthrough a method for examining the usability of an interactive system (website, application, mobile app etc.)  by using a combination of a scenario based and heuristic (i.e. best practice guidelines) based review. I also discuss when usability reviews are most useful and outline some of the pros and cons of the technique.</p><h2>What are usability reviews?</h2><p>Usability reviews are a structured means of examining the usability of an interactive system by evaluating it against a set of recognised usability best practice principles. Reviews are usually carried out by usability experts, but don’t let that put you off carrying out your own because with a bit of know how and a good set of guidelines anyone can have a go.</p><p>Broadly speaking there are two different types of usability review – scenario based reviews and heuristic based reviews. Scenario based reviews evaluate a system against likely user scenarios, such as buying a product for an ecommerce website. Heuristic reviews on the other hand evaluate an interface against a set of usability heuristics (i.e. best practice), such as links being clear, descriptive and well labelled. The two are by no means mutually exclusive and are often most effective when used together (as you will see).</p><h2>Usability reviews – the good news</h2><p>Usability reviews have a lot going for them as a usability technique, including:</p><ul><li>Usability reviews are <strong>quick and cheap to carry out</strong>. A comprehensive usability review can often be carried in just one or two days.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can be carried out by relative novices</strong> (provided that they have received at least some training in the technique and have a good set of guidelines to follow).</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can have a 	wide scope</strong>. Whereas usability testing generally evaluates a few specific tasks, usability reviews can quickly cover lots of different functions, usage scenarios and usability areas for a system.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>are great for competitive benchmarking</strong>. Different systems can be easily compared against the same usability criteria.</li></ul><h2>Usability reviews – the bad news</h2><p>Alas it’s not all good news. Usability reviews also have a number of short comings that you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Usability reviews don’t 	actually tell you how usable a system is, </strong>just how usable it should be. The only way to really test the usability of asystem is 	to do just that – test it using usability testing and by examining 	real world usage.</li><li><strong>Important usability issues can be missed</strong> and <strong>suspected usability issues might not be issues at all </strong>as usability reviews are by their nature educated guesses.</li><li><strong>Usability reviews can be inconsistent</strong>. Numerous studies have shown that multiple evaluators evaluating the same system often identify markedly 	different sets of usability issues (known as the evaluator effect).</li><li><strong>Usability reviews are subjective</strong> and because there’s no empirical evidence it can be difficult to argue the case for fixing suspected usability issues.</li><li><strong>Usability reviews are dependant on the expertise of the evaluator</strong>. Although usability reviews can be carried out by relative novices, if adequate training and guidance is not provided then results can be inconsistent and significant usability issues can be missed.</li></ul><h2>How to carry out a usability review</h2><p>The usability review method that I’m going to walkthrough involves carrying out a scenario based review in the form of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_walkthrough\">cognitive walkthrough</a>, and then a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation\">heuristic based review</a> using a usability review scorecard that I’ve put together (based on usability best practice principles). I’ve found that using the two techniques together works really well because it means that lots of bases are covered and ensures that a system is evaluated against likely usage. Carrying out the cognitive walkthrough first also helps builds up a good understanding of the system prior to the heuristic based review. Want to know more? Here’s how to carry out a comprehensive usability review.</p><h3>1. Define your usability review scenarios</h3><p>A cognitive walkthrough provides a means of evaluating the usability of a system by testing how well it supports a common user task in the form of a <a href=\"../../scenario-mapping/\">scenario</a>. You basically take a scenario, such as a punter placing a bet on a betting website, and walk through the steps that this user might take to achieve their goal. To do this you should first define some user scenarios to walkthrough. These should cover common and important user tasks that are crucial to the success of the system. For example, if you were evaluating a mobile phone you might look at adding a new contact; sending a text message and making a phone call as just some of the user scenarios to review. For each scenario you should answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Who </strong>is using the system? Has he or she used it before? You don’t need to build a rich <a href=\"../../personas/\">persona</a> for your user, just enough information to start making educated guesses about their behaviour.</li><li><strong>What </strong>is he or she trying to do? What task is he or she attempting to undertake? Is this the first time this person has attempted this task?</li><li><strong>Why</strong> is he or she using the system? What is their goal?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> is he or she using 	the system?  If a website is being reviewed, which browser is this person likely to use?</li></ul><p>The number of scenarios you review will depend on how extensive the usability review needs to be, and how wide the scope of the system is. For most reviews you’ll find that you will only probably need to cover 2-5 scenarios. It’s also a good idea to cover multiple scenarios with the same persona wherever possible.</p><h3>2. Walkthrough each scenario</h3><p>Having defined each scenario you’ll now need to walkthrough the steps that your persona is likely to take to achieve their goal. Of course it’s impossible to know exactly how someone will undertake a task so this is very much a best guess based on asking the following questions at each step:</p><ol><li><strong>Will the user know what to do?<br /></strong>Is there a clear route for the user to take? Is it obvious what the user needs to do at this step?</li><li><strong>Will the user see how to do it?<br /></strong>Is the call to action obvious?<strong></strong>Is it clear how the 	user completes this step?</li><li><strong>Will the user know whether their action was correct?<br /></strong>What sort of feedback is provided? Is it clear whether the user is on the correct path or not?</li></ol><p>You should continue the walkthrough for each scenario until you think the user is likely to have achieved their goal, or conversely is likely to have given up. Exactly how you capture each walkthrough is of course up to you. In the past I’ve found using a separate screenshot on each page with the above questions (Will the user know what to do? etc…) and answers for each step a good template to use.</p><h3>3. Fill out the usability review scorecard</h3><p>Having carried out a walkthrough for each scenario you should now be in a good position to carry out a heuristic review. Rather than using <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html\">Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics</a> I’ve found it easier to use more explicit usability heuristics based on usability best practice principles, such as making sure that error messages are descriptive and written in plain English. Nielsen’s usability heuristics are certainly useful and are something to keep in mind when carrying out a usability review but I find that they can be somewhat subjective and that less experienced reviewers can struggle to directly apply them. More explicit usability heuristics are more transparent, making it easier to see the link between a system and it’s judged usability, and are easier for less experienced reviewers to follow.</p><p>To carry out the heuristic part of the usability review simply download the Excel template below and you enter a score (very poor, poor, moderate, good etc…) and comments for each of the 45 best practice usability principles. The principles cover:</p><ul><li>Features and functionality</li><li>Homepage / starting page</li><li>Navigation</li><li>Search</li><li>Feedback</li><li>Forms</li><li>Errors</li><li>Content &amp; text</li><li>Help</li><li>Performance (e.g. response rate and absence of crashing)</li></ul><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"excel-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.xls\" target=\"new\">Usability review template (Excel, 100KB)</a></li></ul><p>The scorecard will deliver a final usability score (out of 100), allowing for different systems to be compared against the same set of usability criteria. This is especially useful for competitive benchmarking but please bear in mind that a high score doesn’t necessary mean that something is usable, merely that it follows best practice principles (if that makes sense). Heuristics are weighted to ensure that more important points, such as ‘Features and functionality meet common user goals and objectives’ have a greater affect on the overall score than less significant ones. If you’re somewhat old school and prefer pencil and paper to typing comments directly in you can also download a PDF template for doing just this.</p><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"pdf-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.pdf\" target=\"new\">Usability review template (PDF, 20KB)</a></li></ul><h2>When are usability reviews most useful?</h2><p>Usability reviews are perhaps most useful for a first pass evaluation of a design (all the way from conceptual to high fidelity), and for evaluating a pre-existing design to investigate potential areas for improvement. Also don’t think that it’s a case of either carrying out a usability review or usability testing because like bananas and custard, or gin and tonic, the two are a great combination. A usability review will give you an idea of some of the usability issues that might exist and usability testing will allow you to validate these assumptions and to explore any areas of concern in more detail.</p><p>Usability reviews are also incredibly useful for carrying out competitive benchmarking because they allow you to easily compare the usability of a set of systems against the same criteria. For example, you might work out the usability score for a raft of competitors to see how they compare to your system.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-usability/website-review.shtml\">Expert usability review vs. usability testing (Webcredible)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.2791&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">The Evaluator Effect: A Chilling Fact about Usability Evaluation Methods (International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fusability-reviews%2F&amp;title=A%20guide%20to%20carrying%20out%20usability%20reviews\" id=\"wpa2a_18\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-reviews/feed/") (slash:comments nil "8")) (item nil (title nil "What makes a good UX designer?")

In this article I outline some of the skills, characteristics and qualities that in my opinion a good UX designer should possess and discuss what it is that I think really makes for a good UX designer.</p><h2>But there’s no such thing as a typical UX designer</h2><p>Before I dive in to what in my opinion makes a good UX designer I think that it’s worth pointing out that in my experience there’s really no such thing as a typical UX designer. Although UX related degree and masters courses exist there certainly isn’t a production line somewhere churning out sparkly new UX designers and at the moment there’s very little formal accreditation or certification within the industry (Human Factors International’s <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp\">Certified Usability Analyst</a> and <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CXA.asp\">Certified User Experience Analyst</a> are the only UX related certifications that spring to mind). This is partly because it’s such a new discipline but also because it’s such a varied role and one that invariably requires a wide range of skills and qualities. However, although I don’t think there’s such a thing as a typical UX designer, there are certainly skills, qualities and characteristics that are common across most good UX designers. Here are what I think the most important ones are.</p><h2>Being like Mr T</h2><div id=\"attachment_823\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-823\" title=\"Mr-T\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\" alt=\"Mr T\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I pity the fool! A good UX designer should have a T-shaped skill set</p></div><p>UX designers by nature are a varied bunch. Some come from a technical background; others come from a psychology or graphical design background and others from an industrial design or technical writing background. This means that most UX designers have quite a varied skill set, which is a good thing because to a large extent UX designers should be a jack of several trades, and a master of some. That’s not to say that they should be able to fix a leaking tap, write a best selling novel and run a 4 minute mile, just that UX designers should have excellent design and research skills, along with a good knowledge of related skills, such as graphic design, software development and project management. Such a varied role calls for a varied skill set, one which is typically T-shaped (hence the rather tenuous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T\">Mr T</a> reference). In other words, UX designers should have a good breadth of knowledge, with a good depth of knowledge in a few integral areas, including&#8230;</p><h2>Being a designer</h2><p>First and foremost I think that a UX designer should be just that &#8211; a designer. This means having a deep knowledge and understanding of user-centred design techniques and principles and being able to design products, be they websites, desktop applications, kiosks or mobile apps that achieve their goals and deliver the intended user experience. It also means having a bag of design tricks up the proverbial sleeve, such as personas, scenarios, storyboards, design sketching and rapid prototyping; and of course knowing when and where to use them.</p><h2>Being a researcher</h2><p>UX designers obviously need to be designers, but they shouldn’t just be designers. They should also be researchers. I don’t necessarily mean the sort of rigorous scientific research that is often undertaken by men in white coats, but design focused research, such as usability testing, ethnography, user interviews, card sorting and analytics. Good designs are founded on good research and feedback, and UX designers should be skilled in gathering this sort of information. Some organisations have traditionally split out UX design and research functions into different teams but I think that this rarely works because the two are so intrinsically connected. One goes hand in hand with the other and to be a really great designer you need to be able to get involved in the research for a design, from the very beginning to hopefully the end.</p><h2>Being a techie</h2><p>Whilst UX design is not primarily a technical discipline I do think that it requires a good understanding of how a design might be built and what some of the technical implications for a design are. After all, it’s no good creating a fantastic design if it can’t be built, or building it would take too long and cost too much in its current form. Equally when discussing a design with engineers and developers you need to know whether, “this can’t be done” really means that something can’t be done, or that it can be done, but in a slightly different way. It also pays to know a thing or two about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility\">Accessibility</a> (sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design\">Universal design</a>) as it can be difficult to make some designs accessible. Technical skills, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and basic coding can also be useful when it comes to creating prototypes, especially as developers are not always on hand to help out.</p><h2>Being a creative</h2><p>UX design is an inherently visual discipline (in so much as people generally take in the largest proportion of their input visually when using a website, software package or other type of interactive system)  and as such the use of colour, layout, imagery, typography and aesthetics in general play an important role in most, if not all designs. I don’t think that UX designers necessarily need to be accomplished graphic designers, but they should at least be aware of graphic design principles such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\">golden ratio</a>, <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/od/alignment/ss/alignment_6.htm\">visual alignment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allgraphicdesign.com/graphicsblog/2008/03/04/the-rules-of-the-gestalt-theory-and-how-to-apply-it-to-your-graphic-design-layouts/\">Gesalt theory</a> and should be able to create designs that don’t look like a dog’s dinner. It’s also worth remembering that it can usually be easier to present and sell designs that are pleasing on the eye (even if they are in their most primitive form) to a sceptical client or customer.</p><h2>Being a suit</h2><p>UX design nearly always takes place within a business context, whether it’s designing a marketable product, carrying out some commissioned work or setting up a new website. I think that it’s therefore important that UX designers are comfortable in the business world and that they possess a good range of business skills. UX designers need to be adept at not only dealing with users, but also colleagues and clients and should be comfortable chairing meetings, running workshops, managing stakeholders and writing business cases etc&#8230; It’s also important to remember that behind every design there’s a set of business goals and objectives, such as selling more products, or converting more customers. UX designers need to be able to understand and interpret what the ultimate goal of a design is and be able to communicate this back to the bean counters in the business.</p><h2>Being a team player</h2><p>UX designers are rarely lonesome beasts and can generally be found working very closely with developers, engineers, clients, project managers, fellow designers and all manor of other people. I think that it’s therefore important that they have good team working sills and are comfortable collaborating, mentoring, critiquing, assisting and generally operating within a team environment.</p><div id=\"attachment_824\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-824\" title=\"UX-designer-skillset\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\" alt=\"T-shaped skill set for a UX designer\" width=\"728\" height=\"261\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sort of T-shaped skill set that a good UX designer should possess</p></div><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"pdf-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skill-set.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A good UX designer&#8217;s T-shaped skill set (PDF, 36KB)</a></li></ul><h2>It’s more than just skills</h2><p>What makes Lionel Messi the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9356019.stm\">best footballer in the world at the moment</a>? Sure he has incredible skills and unbelievable technique, but it’s also his desire, his unselfishness, his work rate and his creativity that makes him a truly great player. The same is true of really good UX designers. Good UX designers, don’t just have the right skills, they also have the sort of personal qualities and characteristics that are so important for the role. Along with possessing an appropriate T-shaped skill set I think that good UX designers should also be:</p><div id=\"attachment_825\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Lionel-Messi.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-825\" title=\"Lionel-Messi\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Lionel-Messi.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi\" width=\"300\" height=\"262\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It&#39;s more than just skills and technique that makes Lionel Messi a truly great footballer</p></div><ul><li><strong>Assertive</strong> – UX designers needs to be able to lead and direct a discussion and assert themselves when necessary.</li><li><strong>Co-operative</strong> – UX designers needs to be able to work very closely with their colleagues.</li><li><strong>Creative</strong> – UX designers should be able to create compelling and original designs.</li><li><strong>Diplomatic</strong> – UX designers needs to know when to compromise and how to play politics when required to do so.</li><li><strong>Enthusiastic</strong> – UX designers should be infecting team mates with their enthusiasm for UX design.</li><li><strong>Humble</strong> – UX designers should be able to accept that sometimes their design sucks.</li><li><strong>Intellectual</strong> – UX designers should be able to argue the case for their design, or indeed for taking a user-centred design approach in the first place.</li><li><strong>Observant</strong> – UX designers should be able to spot easily missed user insights and nuances.</li><li><strong>Open </strong>– UX designers needs to be open to ideas, suggestions and feedback; and be willing to share their expertise with others.</li><li><strong>Patient </strong>– UX designers need to be able to accept that good design and good user research often takes a little time and perseverance.</li><li><strong>Personable </strong>– UX designers doesn’t need to be everyone’s friend but should be able to easily get along with others.</li><li><strong>Persuasive </strong>– UX designers needs to be able to sell a design and bring the intended user experience to life.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong> – UX designers should be able to design within constraints.</li><li><strong>Resilient </strong>– UX designers should be able to take a knock back.</li><li><strong>Tenacious</strong> – UX designers needs to be able to defend their corner when necessary.</li><li><strong>Thorough</strong> – UX designers needs to get the nitty gritty details right.</li></ul><h2>Being dedicated</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzWRYr-b_Y\">It’s not just record breaking that requires dedication</a>, being a good UX designer does as well. If there is one quality that I think is common across all good UX designers it’s dedication to the discipline and dedication to being a good UX designer. Dedication means continually seeking out interesting new design examples and ideas. Its means sharing your own expertise and know how with others. It means learning from other design disciplines, such as architecture, industrial design and software design. It means attending UX design talks, conferences and get togethers in order to learn from other UX designers. Above all it means continually building and refining the skills and characteristics that make a really good UX designer and putting these into practice as much as possible. It’s often said that it takes 10 thousand hours of practice to truly master a discipline (sometimes called the <a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/10000-hour-rule\">10,000 hour rule</a>). Whilst I don’t think that you need to put in this many hours before you can call yourself a good UX designer, there’s no denying that the more hours you put in, the better designer you will be.</p><h2>Related books and articles</h2><p>Some related articles:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/11/the-five-competencies-of-user-experience-design.php\">The Five Competencies of User Experience Design (UX Matters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/12/essential-and-desirable-skills-for-a-ux-designer.php\">Essential and Desirable Skills for a UX Designer (UX Matters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.uie.com/articles/assessing_ux_teams/\">Assessing Your Team&#8217;s UX Skills (User Interface Engineering)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.foolproof.co.uk/grow-your-ux-skill-set/\">Grow your UX skill set (Foolproof blog)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2009/06/30/so-you-wanna-be-a-user-experience-designer-step-1-resources/\">So you wanna be a user experience designer (Whitney Hess)</a></li></ul><p>Books are an excellent way to build your UX designer skill set.

This means at the very least letting people know that UX  people like yourself exist within the organisation, outlining the sort of work  you do and spelling out why UX is so important to the organisation in the first  place.

This is a luxury rarely afforded in-house where it’s often down to you to  carry out the lion share of the UX work for a project (which is a good thing –  variety is the spice of life). This is why it’s important to have a broad UX  skill set, to be a jack of several trades, and a master of some. To find out  more about the sort of skills that I think are important checkout my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/what-makes-good-ux-designer/\">What makes a  good UX designer?</a> article.</p><h2>Increase the UX project mix</h2><p>Working in-house you often don’t the opportunity to work on  the same breadth of projects as you might if working within an agency or  consultancy. A good way to increase the mixture of UX projects you get to work  on is to try to initiate some internal design projects (think <a href=\"http://www.googlelabs.com/\">Google labs</a> if you can swing it) and to  utilise your UX design skills elsewhere with the organisation. For example, you  might make some suggestions for improving the company Intranet or try to get  involved with products where UX design has traditionally not been carried out  (internal systems are perennial examples of this).</p><h2>Keep your UX skills up-to-date</h2><p>It’s perhaps not as easy to be exposed to the latest UX  thinking, techniques, methods, debates and discussions when working within the  in-house company bubble, which is why it’s really important to keep your UX  skills fresh and up-to-date. Make sure that you find the time to read UX books  and blogs (like this one!), attend as many UX events, conferences and training  courses as you can and never pass up the opportunity to connect with fellow  UXers (see below).</p><h2>Connect with fellow UXers</h2><div id=\"attachment_1158\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\" alt=\"An audience at a UX conference\" title=\"UX-conference\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1158\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UX conferences and events are a great way to connect with fellow UXers</p></div><p>It can sometimes be lonely working in-house (cue the violin  music). You might work within a small UX team or even be the sole UXer within  your organisation and so might be starved of like minded company. This is why  it’s important to get out there and connect with fellow UXers as much as  possible. You’ll feel better for sharing ideas, discussing problems that you’re  experiencing and generally talking UX. You could hook up with a local UX group;  join a UX discussion group such as <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/\">UX  exchange</a>; or even persuade your manager to let you attend a UX conference  (you’ll be amazed at where continual nagging can get you). You’ll be surprised  at how much UX related stuff there is out there for you to get involved with.</p><h2>Be realistic about the design process you can undertake</h2><p>For any in-house UX project it’s important to be realistic  about the design process that you can undertake because whilst a design  consultancy such as <a href=\"http://www.cooper.com/\">Cooper</a> might be able  to sell and subsequently follow an extensive UX design process – you’re  unlikely to be able to do this in-house (at least not initially). Often there  simply aren’t the resources, know how or appetite to do this in-house and  you’re only setting yourself up for monumental disappointment if you think that  you’re going to be able to replicate what they do. Try to find a design process  that fits your organisation’s way of doing things and be realistic about how  much UX design work you’re likely to be able to fit in. </p><h2>Focus on delivery, not deliverables</h2><p>To quote Cennydd Bowles and James Box from their excellent <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience Design</a> book, “<em>We believe in delivery, not deliverables.  Some people practice user-scented design, not user-centred design. They churn  out documents – sitemaps, wireframes, specifications – but they’re not  interested in what happens next. UX is a mindset, not a process – it lasts all  the way until the site is live, and after</em>”. A UX designer should be judged  by their designs and delivery, not their deliverables and whilst an agency or consultancy  might feel compelled to produce exquisitely beautiful documents to make their  clients gasp in delight, you hopefully shouldn’t have to. That’s not to say that  your deliverables shouldn’t look professional, but don’t spend any more time on  deliverables than you really have to. Ultimately it’s delivering the right user  experience to the end user that counts.</p><h2>Recognise when to bring in outside help</h2><div id=\"attachment_1159\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\" alt=\"The A-team\" title=\"A-team\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1159\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...Some outside help. Da da daa, da da da</p></div><p>It’s not always possible or indeed desirable to do all UX work  in-house and it’s important to recognise when bringing in some additional UX  resources makes sense. It could be that you need help with the UX workload,  want to bring in a particular specialist or simply because some stakeholders  will respond more favourably to someone from outside the organisation telling  them news they don’t want to hear. Whilst outsourcing some aspects of UX can  certainly make sense be careful with what you outsource. For example, whilst  outsourcing activities such as UX training and usability testing can work quite  well, you really want to keep the core of the UX design work in-house.</p><h2>Create an in-house UX community</h2><p>Even though there might not be too many fellow UXers within  your organisation it doesn’t mean that you can’t create and foster a community  of people who share your interest and passion for user experience. You’ll be  surprised at the number of people that are likely to show an interest in learning  more about user experience, from developers and business analysts to project  managers and technical authors. There are many ways that you can help create  and foster a strong in-house UX community – here are just a few suggestions to  get you started:</p><ul><li>Set-up regular get togethers to discuss different  aspects of UX.</li><li>Arrange UX knowledgeshares and try to get  external speakers to come in to talk about a particular UX topic.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX blog or newsletter.</li><li>Organise a UX book club.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX mailing list where people  can post UX related questions.</li><li>Organise trips to UX related events and exhibits.</li></ul><h2>Utilise a UX resources library</h2><p>Most agencies and consultancies have the benefit of years of  accumulated UX templates and example deliverables to utilise, so why not set something  similar up within your organisation? If you think that something might be reusable  then stick it in the library because you never know when something might come  in handy for a future project.</p><h2>Don’t stop til you get enough</h2><p>Follow Michael Jackson’s sound advice and “<a href=\"http://www.michaeljackson.com/uk/don039t-stop-039til-you-get-enough-video\">Don’t  stop til you get enough</a>”, enough of whatever your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator\">performance  indicators</a> (a.k.a. KPIs) are that is. Working in-house you should not only  be able to see your designs through to delivery but also should be able to  continue to assess and improve them once they’re out in the real world. To find  out more about the importance of continually improving the UX of your product,  and how you might go about doing this take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/evolutionary-ux-design/\">Evolutionary UX  design article</a>.</p><h2>Don’t give up (good things come to those who wait…)</h2><p>It can often be very frustrating working in-house when there  is a constant push back on carrying out UX work. It can seem like a continual  battle to get UX included on projects – but try not to get too disheartened and  recognise that organisational change happens very slowly (we’re talking light  years in some places). Taking an organisation from UX newbies to old hats takes  an awful lot of time and effort (not to mention blood, sweat and tears) so try  not to give up too early because good things come to those who wait…</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fin-house-ux%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20make%20it%20as%20an%20in-house%20UXer\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/in-house-ux/" (20068 41178) new 1 nil nil ((title nil "How to make it as an in-house UXer") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/in-house-ux/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/in-house-ux/#comments") (pubDate nil "Mon, 05 Sep 2011 10:13:46 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "UX strategy") (category nil "In-house") (category nil "UX design") (guid ((isPermaLink .

A good way to increase the mixture of UX projects you get to work  on is to try to initiate some internal design projects (think <a href=\"http://www.googlelabs.com/\">Google labs</a> if you can swing it) and to  utilise your UX design skills elsewhere with the organisation. For example, you  might make some suggestions for improving the company Intranet or try to get  involved with products where UX design has traditionally not been carried out  (internal systems are perennial examples of this).</p><h2>Keep your UX skills up-to-date</h2><p>It’s perhaps not as easy to be exposed to the latest UX  thinking, techniques, methods, debates and discussions when working within the  in-house company bubble, which is why it’s really important to keep your UX  skills fresh and up-to-date. Make sure that you find the time to read UX books  and blogs (like this one!), attend as many UX events, conferences and training  courses as you can and never pass up the opportunity to connect with fellow  UXers (see below).</p><h2>Connect with fellow UXers</h2><div id=\"attachment_1158\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/UX-conference.jpg\" alt=\"An audience at a UX conference\" title=\"UX-conference\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1158\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">UX conferences and events are a great way to connect with fellow UXers</p></div><p>It can sometimes be lonely working in-house (cue the violin  music). You might work within a small UX team or even be the sole UXer within  your organisation and so might be starved of like minded company. This is why  it’s important to get out there and connect with fellow UXers as much as  possible. You’ll feel better for sharing ideas, discussing problems that you’re  experiencing and generally talking UX. You could hook up with a local UX group;  join a UX discussion group such as <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/\">UX  exchange</a>; or even persuade your manager to let you attend a UX conference  (you’ll be amazed at where continual nagging can get you). You’ll be surprised  at how much UX related stuff there is out there for you to get involved with.</p><h2>Be realistic about the design process you can undertake</h2><p>For any in-house UX project it’s important to be realistic  about the design process that you can undertake because whilst a design  consultancy such as <a href=\"http://www.cooper.com/\">Cooper</a> might be able  to sell and subsequently follow an extensive UX design process – you’re  unlikely to be able to do this in-house (at least not initially). Often there  simply aren’t the resources, know how or appetite to do this in-house and  you’re only setting yourself up for monumental disappointment if you think that  you’re going to be able to replicate what they do. Try to find a design process  that fits your organisation’s way of doing things and be realistic about how  much UX design work you’re likely to be able to fit in. </p><h2>Focus on delivery, not deliverables</h2><p>To quote Cennydd Bowles and James Box from their excellent <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience Design</a> book, “<em>We believe in delivery, not deliverables.  Some people practice user-scented design, not user-centred design. They churn  out documents – sitemaps, wireframes, specifications – but they’re not  interested in what happens next. UX is a mindset, not a process – it lasts all  the way until the site is live, and after</em>”. A UX designer should be judged  by their designs and delivery, not their deliverables and whilst an agency or consultancy  might feel compelled to produce exquisitely beautiful documents to make their  clients gasp in delight, you hopefully shouldn’t have to. That’s not to say that  your deliverables shouldn’t look professional, but don’t spend any more time on  deliverables than you really have to. Ultimately it’s delivering the right user  experience to the end user that counts.</p><h2>Recognise when to bring in outside help</h2><div id=\"attachment_1159\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/A-team.jpg\" alt=\"The A-team\" title=\"A-team\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1159\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...Some outside help. Da da daa, da da da</p></div><p>It’s not always possible or indeed desirable to do all UX work  in-house and it’s important to recognise when bringing in some additional UX  resources makes sense. It could be that you need help with the UX workload,  want to bring in a particular specialist or simply because some stakeholders  will respond more favourably to someone from outside the organisation telling  them news they don’t want to hear. Whilst outsourcing some aspects of UX can  certainly make sense be careful with what you outsource. For example, whilst  outsourcing activities such as UX training and usability testing can work quite  well, you really want to keep the core of the UX design work in-house.</p><h2>Create an in-house UX community</h2><p>Even though there might not be too many fellow UXers within  your organisation it doesn’t mean that you can’t create and foster a community  of people who share your interest and passion for user experience. You’ll be  surprised at the number of people that are likely to show an interest in learning  more about user experience, from developers and business analysts to project  managers and technical authors. There are many ways that you can help create  and foster a strong in-house UX community &#8211; here are just a few suggestions to  get you started:</p><ul><li>Set-up regular get togethers to discuss different  aspects of UX.</li><li>Arrange UX knowledgeshares and try to get  external speakers to come in to talk about a particular UX topic.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX blog or newsletter.</li><li>Organise a UX book club.</li><li>Set-up an internal UX mailing list where people  can post UX related questions.</li><li>Organise trips to UX related events and exhibits.</li></ul><h2>Utilise a UX resources library</h2><p>Most agencies and consultancies have the benefit of years of  accumulated UX templates and example deliverables to utilise, so why not set something  similar up within your organisation? If you think that something might be reusable  then stick it in the library because you never know when something might come  in handy for a future project.</p><h2>Don’t stop til you get enough</h2><p>Follow Michael Jackson’s sound advice and “<a href=\"http://www.michaeljackson.com/uk/don039t-stop-039til-you-get-enough-video\">Don’t  stop til you get enough</a>”, enough of whatever your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator\">performance  indicators</a> (a.k.a. KPIs) are that is. Working in-house you should not only  be able to see your designs through to delivery but also should be able to  continue to assess and improve them once they’re out in the real world. To find  out more about the importance of continually improving the UX of your product,  and how you might go about doing this take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/evolutionary-ux-design/\">Evolutionary UX  design article</a>.</p><h2>Don’t give up (good things come to those who wait…)</h2><p>It can often be very frustrating working in-house when there  is a constant push back on carrying out UX work. It can seem like a continual  battle to get UX included on projects – but try not to get too disheartened and  recognise that organisational change happens very slowly (we’re talking light  years in some places). Taking an organisation from UX newbies to old hats takes  an awful lot of time and effort (not to mention blood, sweat and tears) so try  not to give up too early because good things come to those who wait&#8230;</p><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fin-house-ux%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20make%20it%20as%20an%20in-house%20UXer\" id=\"wpa2a_2\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/in-house-ux/feed/") (slash:comments nil "3"))) ("Recommended UX books for aspiring UXers" "<p>Joseph Addison (an English author, playwright, politician  and all round lover of the written word) once said that, “Reading is to the  mind what exercise is to the body.” In which case give your mind the exercise  it craves by picking up some good UX books and get reading.

If  you’re like me you’ll make a big list of stuff that needs doing and then decide  to do it all some other day because you’ve found something much more  interesting to do.

The issue  invariably falls by the way side and gets lost in the mists of time, never to  be resolved (sob).

They usually involve either something  seemingly really minor, like the colour of hyperlinks or something very highly  prized, like real estate on a homepage. Voices usually get raised, people  become very animated and swords are often drawn ready for combat  (metaphorically of course). In such circumstances it’s always worth ensuring  that you’ve come ready for combat, preferably with lots of evidence to back up  your position. This might be in the form of user feedback, analytics data,  research findings or even just a really good reason for why a particular design  is a good idea. People find it much harder to argue against facts, figures and  findings than just opinion and conjecture, so try to bring these to the table  and hopefully you’ll come out of the battle, I mean discussion victorious.</p><h2>3. Failing to explain UX terminology</h2><p>Like most disciplines user experience has its own set of  secret terminology to maintain that all important cloak of mystery. Do you  think your average business person knows precisely what wireframe are? What  about a contextual enquiry or a heuristic evaluation? It can be all too easy to  use UX terms without releasing that people are not going to know what they  mean, or even worse will misinterpret them. For example when you talk about wireframes,  they might think that you’re referring to the finished visual design, so are  going to be a little surprised when you come back with something as colourful  as an old black and white movie. This is why it’s so important to explain UX  terms that are used (or even use terms that people are likely to be familiar  with), to communicate exactly what UX deliverables such as prototypes,  wireframes and personas are and to set expectations upfront. This way you can  keep misunderstandings, not to mention nasty shocks and surprises to a minimum.</p><h2>4. Being overly negative</h2><div id=\"attachment_1079\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Eeyor.gif\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Eeyor.gif\" alt=\"Eeyor\" title=\"Eeyor\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1079\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eeyor the new UX designer struggled to get people to listen to what he had to say</p></div><p>Remember that feeling you got when you received a piece of  school homework that you’d spent ages and ages on only to get a rubbish mark? Pretty  disheartening wasn’t it (and to all those would said ‘no’ – you’re lying). Well  that’s the same feeling that people get when you tell them that the design  they’ve spent ages lovingly crafting sucks (although hopefully not in those  exact words). A great deal of user experience design involves critiquing,  evaluating and testing designs, whether its as part of usability testing,  design critiques or simply delivering your two pennies worth about a quick UI  sketch. It’s therefore no surprise that often UX designers find themselves  delivering bad news. Pointing out problems, potential issues and improvements  is of course vitally important but remember to not be overly negative because  this can sometimes be counter productive. Only delivering bad news can not only  reduce recipients of said news to a sobbing mess but also increase the  likelihood of resistance to your feedback. No one likes hearing only bad news  so also be sure to point out what’s good about the design – what works well and  what improvements can be made. By outlining what’s good about a design as well  as what’s bad you’re more likely to get buy-in and avoid the reputation for  being the office <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore\">Eeyore</a>.</p><h2>5. Becoming too attached to a design</h2><p>Your team has spent ages working on a radical new design for  an application. Everyone in the team thinks that it’s the bee’s knees, expect  unfortunately the users who where less than forthcoming in their praise during some  usability testing. Do you keep hold of your pride and joy and tell yourself  that those pesky users don’t know what’s good for them, or go back to the  drawing board? In situations like this it can be very difficult to ditch a  design that you’ve spent a lot of time working on (and probably become very  attached to) but often this is precisely what you should do. It’s a mistake  becoming too attached to a design because ultimately you must be able to assess  each design objectively. If user feedback is indicating that a design isn’t  working then don’t be afraid to change it. Of course this is again why getting  early and frequent user feedback is so important and it’s also why coming up  with a number of different designs is such a good idea. Take a leaf out of <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_process.html\">Apple’s  design book</a> and come up with a number of designs which you can then whittle  down to the one that works best. This sort of design <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">Darwinian selection</a> not only leads to the survival of the fittest design but also generally stops  you becoming too attached to a particular design, simply because it’s the only  one you’ve got.</p><h2>6. Buffing and polishing deliverables until they sparkle</h2><p>A good designer (or design team) should be judged on their  design, not their deliverables. Unless you’re sadly not able to see a design  through to delivery and as such your end goal is a set of deliverables (for  example you’ve been brought in just to deliver a design spec) then it’s a  mistake to spend any more time on deliverables than you really have to. Sure  you don’t want documents with lots of typos and wireframes that look like  they’ve been put together by a five year old (although I’ve seen plenty of  wireframes where a five year could have probably done a better job) but  certainly don’t spend more time making your deliverables look good than  actually creating them in the first place. Take a leaf out of Cennydd Bowles  and James Box’s <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience  design manifesto</a> and focus on delivery, not deliverables. Ultimately  deliverables are only a means to an end, it’s the delivery that really counts.</p><h2>7. Starting from scratch</h2><div id=\"attachment_1082\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Boy on bike with a square front wheel\" title=\"square-wheel\" width=\"300\" height=\"343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1082\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The design team questioned whether 'starting from scratch' was the right approach</p></div><p>A lot of UX design is about creating stuff. Creating  prototypes, creating documents, creating designs and so on. Whenever you’re  creating something you’ve got to start from somewhere but it’s certainly a  mistake for that somewhere to always be from scratch. Rather than creating a  persona from scratch see if there is a template out there you can use (<a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Agile-persona-templates.zip\">like  this persona template</a>). Rather than creating a set of scenarios from  scratch see if there are some example scenario documents out there you can  borrow the format of. Rather than creating a new design from scratch see if  there are some <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">design  patterns</a> out there you can utilise. Sometimes of course you really do have  to start from scratch, but really this should be the exception rather than the  rule.</p><h2>8. Failing to dot the I’s and cross the T’s</h2><p>When it comes to user experience often the devil is in the  detail. A user’s experience is made up of a thousand tiny details, from a mouse  click here to a piece of text there and if those details are a bit slap dash in  parts they will eventually build up to one crappy overall user experience. This  is why it’ so important to make sure that all those tiny details are as  intended and as they should be. That copy doesn’t contain any typos or spelling  mistakes. That text casing is consistent. That elements are properly aligned  and so on. Don’t think that you can rest easy because everything will be picked  up by the test team, or perhaps the development team because their focus is  usually on the functional side of things, not the UX side of things. Ultimately  the design team should be responsible for the UX design, therefore poor  attention to detail not only reflects badly on a website or application but  also the design team behind that website or application.</p><h2>9. Letting information about users slip through the cracks</h2><p>How much information do you have available about your users?  Probably more than you think. There’s the customer satisfaction survey that was  run last year that you weren’t aware of. There’s the persona research that was  undertaken for a different project. There’s the report from a usability testing  consultancy that’s gathering dust somewhere (you get the idea). Often user  research, usability testing and UX design work is carried out by different  teams within an organisation, or even farmed out to different suppliers so it’s  no surprise that the information can become very fragmented. Often really  valuable information about users gets lost in the ether because teams don’t  talk to one another, don’t organise their user information or simply don’t  bother to retain it from project to project. This is why it’s such a good idea  to have regular discussions between teams and to have a place where information  about users can be shared, stored and discussed (such as a <a href=\"http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/\">Sharepoint</a> or <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">Basecamp</a> site).</p><h2>10. Over analysing every design decision</h2><p>There’s a now infamous story from <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/\">Douglas Bowman</a> about <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html\">Google  testing 41 different shades of blue</a> to see which one performs best for a  particular design. Now this surely takes over analysing every design decision  to the extreme but don’t make the same mistake of using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing\">user testing</a> as the  only means of making a design decision. Sure it’s great to get some feedback  for a design but often you just have to make a call and go with you’re UX  design gut instinct – and if that fails you can always <a href=\"http://8ball.tridelphia.net/\">ask the magic eight ball</a>.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/\">10 UX  mistakes to avoid (UX for the Masses)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fmore-ux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=Another%2010%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_6\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/more-ux-mistakes/" (20028 62475) new 3 nil nil ((title nil "Another 10 UX mistakes to avoid") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/more-ux-mistakes/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/more-ux-mistakes/#comments") (pubDate nil "Sat, 06 Aug 2011 07:58:03 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "UX design") (category nil "UX strategy") (category nil "Mistakes") (category nil "Myths") (guid ((isPermaLink .

Well  that’s the same feeling that people get when you tell them that the design  they’ve spent ages lovingly crafting sucks (although hopefully not in those  exact words). A great deal of user experience design involves critiquing,  evaluating and testing designs, whether its as part of usability testing,  design critiques or simply delivering your two pennies worth about a quick UI  sketch. It’s therefore no surprise that often UX designers find themselves  delivering bad news. Pointing out problems, potential issues and improvements  is of course vitally important but remember to not be overly negative because  this can sometimes be counter productive. Only delivering bad news can not only  reduce recipients of said news to a sobbing mess but also increase the  likelihood of resistance to your feedback. No one likes hearing only bad news  so also be sure to point out what’s good about the design &#8211; what works well and  what improvements can be made. By outlining what’s good about a design as well  as what’s bad you’re more likely to get buy-in and avoid the reputation for  being the office <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore\">Eeyore</a>.</p><h2>5. Becoming too attached to a design</h2><p>Your team has spent ages working on a radical new design for  an application. Everyone in the team thinks that it’s the bee’s knees, expect  unfortunately the users who where less than forthcoming in their praise during some  usability testing. Do you keep hold of your pride and joy and tell yourself  that those pesky users don’t know what’s good for them, or go back to the  drawing board? In situations like this it can be very difficult to ditch a  design that you’ve spent a lot of time working on (and probably become very  attached to) but often this is precisely what you should do. It’s a mistake  becoming too attached to a design because ultimately you must be able to assess  each design objectively. If user feedback is indicating that a design isn’t  working then don’t be afraid to change it. Of course this is again why getting  early and frequent user feedback is so important and it’s also why coming up  with a number of different designs is such a good idea. Take a leaf out of <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_process.html\">Apple’s  design book</a> and come up with a number of designs which you can then whittle  down to the one that works best. This sort of design <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">Darwinian selection</a> not only leads to the survival of the fittest design but also generally stops  you becoming too attached to a particular design, simply because it’s the only  one you’ve got.</p><h2>6. Buffing and polishing deliverables until they sparkle</h2><p>A good designer (or design team) should be judged on their  design, not their deliverables. Unless you’re sadly not able to see a design  through to delivery and as such your end goal is a set of deliverables (for  example you’ve been brought in just to deliver a design spec) then it’s a  mistake to spend any more time on deliverables than you really have to. Sure  you don’t want documents with lots of typos and wireframes that look like  they’ve been put together by a five year old (although I’ve seen plenty of  wireframes where a five year could have probably done a better job) but  certainly don’t spend more time making your deliverables look good than  actually creating them in the first place. Take a leaf out of Cennydd Bowles  and James Box’s <a href=\"http://undercoverux.com/\">Undercover User Experience  design manifesto</a> and focus on delivery, not deliverables. Ultimately  deliverables are only a means to an end, it’s the delivery that really counts.</p><h2>7. Starting from scratch</h2><div id=\"attachment_1082\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/square-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Boy on bike with a square front wheel\" title=\"square-wheel\" width=\"300\" height=\"343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1082\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The design team questioned whether &#039;starting from scratch&#039; was the right approach</p></div><p>A lot of UX design is about creating stuff. Creating  prototypes, creating documents, creating designs and so on. Whenever you’re  creating something you’ve got to start from somewhere but it’s certainly a  mistake for that somewhere to always be from scratch. Rather than creating a  persona from scratch see if there is a template out there you can use (<a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Agile-persona-templates.zip\">like  this persona template</a>). Rather than creating a set of scenarios from  scratch see if there are some example scenario documents out there you can  borrow the format of. Rather than creating a new design from scratch see if  there are some <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">design  patterns</a> out there you can utilise. Sometimes of course you really do have  to start from scratch, but really this should be the exception rather than the  rule.</p><h2>8. Failing to dot the I’s and cross the T’s</h2><p>When it comes to user experience often the devil is in the  detail. A user’s experience is made up of a thousand tiny details, from a mouse  click here to a piece of text there and if those details are a bit slap dash in  parts they will eventually build up to one crappy overall user experience. This  is why it’ so important to make sure that all those tiny details are as  intended and as they should be. That copy doesn’t contain any typos or spelling  mistakes. That text casing is consistent. That elements are properly aligned  and so on. Don’t think that you can rest easy because everything will be picked  up by the test team, or perhaps the development team because their focus is  usually on the functional side of things, not the UX side of things. Ultimately  the design team should be responsible for the UX design, therefore poor  attention to detail not only reflects badly on a website or application but  also the design team behind that website or application.</p><h2>9. Letting information about users slip through the cracks</h2><p>How much information do you have available about your users?  Probably more than you think. There’s the customer satisfaction survey that was  run last year that you weren’t aware of. There’s the persona research that was  undertaken for a different project. There’s the report from a usability testing  consultancy that’s gathering dust somewhere (you get the idea). Often user  research, usability testing and UX design work is carried out by different  teams within an organisation, or even farmed out to different suppliers so it’s  no surprise that the information can become very fragmented. Often really  valuable information about users gets lost in the ether because teams don’t  talk to one another, don’t organise their user information or simply don’t  bother to retain it from project to project. This is why it’s such a good idea  to have regular discussions between teams and to have a place where information  about users can be shared, stored and discussed (such as a <a href=\"http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/\">Sharepoint</a> or <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">Basecamp</a> site).</p><h2>10. Over analysing every design decision</h2><p>There’s a now infamous story from <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/\">Douglas Bowman</a> about <a href=\"http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html\">Google  testing 41 different shades of blue</a> to see which one performs best for a  particular design. Now this surely takes over analysing every design decision  to the extreme but don’t make the same mistake of using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing\">user testing</a> as the  only means of making a design decision. Sure it’s great to get some feedback  for a design but often you just have to make a call and go with you’re UX  design gut instinct – and if that fails you can always <a href=\"http://8ball.tridelphia.net/\">ask the magic eight ball</a>.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/\">10 UX  mistakes to avoid (UX for the Masses)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fmore-ux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=Another%2010%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_6\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/more-ux-mistakes/feed/") (slash:comments nil "3"))) ("10 UX mistakes to avoid" "<p>According to George Bernard Shaw, &quot;A life spent making  mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful than a life spent doing  nothing&quot;.

Customer feedback has  come back saying that the new design is too damn difficult to use, quick get  the UX guys and girls on the case to sort it out. Sound familiar?

The <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/roi.html\">ROI (return on investment) for  usability and UX</a> is generally greater the earlier it’s spent on a project.  Ideally that means getting UX onboard from the very start to undertake such  activities as:</p><ul><li>Investigating user requirements and carrying out  user research.</li><li>Gathering user insights and generating design  ideas based on these.</li><li>Testing and gathering feedback for any existing systems.</li><li>Validating requirements and testing possible  designs before they are actually built.</li></ul><h2>2. Assuming that other people give a damn about UX, or even know what it is</h2><p>I’m assuming that because you’re reading this article you hopefully  already know a thing or two about UX and usability (or soon will!). You also  hopefully care about delivering a good user experience to your users. Well sadly  not everyone knows what UX is and certainly not everyone gives a damn about it.  Of course people care about their users (at least I hope they do) and the  experience they deliver to them but don’t forget that UX design is a means to  an end, not the end itself. People shouldn’t need to care about the process but  they should care about the results. This is why it’s so important to sell the  benefits of UX design and to educate people so that they know what UX design  involves, what the outputs are and why it’s so important. There are loads of  good ways to <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/selling-ux/\">sell UX</a> and to educate and evangelize, from knowledge shares and presentations to  blogs, case studies and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFoz6FGvHo\">introductory  videos</a>.</p><h2>3. Leaving it to the last minute to get user feedback</h2><div id=\"attachment_1052\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/user-head-in-hands.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/user-head-in-hands.jpg\" alt=\"User with their head in their hands\" title=\"user-head-in-hands\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1052\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arrr... Why didn't we test this design with users earlier?</p></div><p>User feedback can sometimes feel a little bit like revision  for a big exam. You know that you should be doing it as early and as often as  possible, but somehow you end up cramming the night before, when really it’s  too late to make a lot of difference. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that  you have to wait for a working version of a design to get user feedback when <a href=\"http://www.paperprototyping.com/\">paper prototyping</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/\">rapid prototyping</a> allows you to test a design long before it’s built.</p><h2>4. Spreading the UX sauce too thinly</h2><p>If like me you work as part of an internal UX team you’ll  probably find that there are a million and one websites and applications that  are in urgent need of a bit of UX TLC (tender loving care). The temptation is  to try and improve as many as possible but this can often be a mistake as all  you end up doing is spreading your resources too thinly and ultimately making  little impact across a multitude of websites and applications. Instead it’s  better to be a bit more selective and to focus your efforts on those websites  and applications that must deliver a really good user experience in order to  succeed. This allows you to make the most of your limited UX resources and to  hopefully get the biggest bang for your UX buck.</p><h2>5. Creating a UX fiefdom</h2><div id=\"attachment_1053\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/castle-small.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/castle-small.jpg\" alt=\"Castle\" title=\"castle\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1053\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The internal UX team went a step too far to protect their fiefdom</p></div><p>For those unfamiliar with the term a fiefdom is, &quot;something  over which one dominant person or group exercises control&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fiefdom\">The free dictionary</a>).  Sometimes internal UX teams can create their own UX fiefdom because they refuse  to let go of any UX design work and crush any attempts to open it up outside of  the group. Of course having a group over seeing UX design to make sure that it’s  done properly makes a lot of sense, but UX design should be something that’s  open to all, not just a select few. There’s no reason for example why someone  with a bit of assistance and know how can’t carry out activities such as  usability testing, expert evaluations, user interviews and UI design to name  but a few. Opening up UX design to the masses (see what I’ve done!) not only  prevents a fiefdom from forming but also allows the UX experts to better  utilise their own time, so really it’s a win win situation!</p><h2>6. Having separate UX researchers and designers</h2><p>A lot of organisations have separate UX research and design  teams, or might send the research and design components of a project out to  different suppliers. On one hand this makes a lot of sense because you obviously  want those people skilled in research carrying out the research and those  skilled in design carrying out the design. However I think that often doing  this means that a lot of the important research insight can get lost in  translation as one team communicates findings to the other. Research also  shouldn’t be carried out for its own sake and it’s important that any design research  is able to feed into and influence the ultimate design. This is why I would  advocate having the same team carrying out both the UX research and design. Of  course within that team you might have research and design specialists but you  want the continuity and know how that having the same team involved throughout  can bring.</p><h2>7. Jumping straight into design</h2><p>When considering a new product or website, or thinking about  how an existing one can be improved it can be very tempting to start designing  straight away. &quot;This is how this screen might work&quot;. &quot;This is what we should  have on the homepage&quot;. Whist it makes sense to certainly start thinking about  the design from the start it can be a mistake to jump in too early without  first considering the bigger picture and hopefully carrying out a bit of  research first. It might turn out for example that a feature you’ve spent  considerable time designing isn’t in tune with how users want to work, or even  worse might not even be required in the first place!</p><h2>8. Creating overly elaborate prototypes and wireframes</h2><p>With increasingly powerful rapid prototyping and wireframing  tools out there, such as <a href=\"http://www.axure.com/\">Axure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/\">Omnigraffle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/SketchFlow_Overview.aspx\">Microsoft  Sketchflow</a> it can be tempting to spend lots of time on an elaborate pixel  perfect (or close to) version of a prototype (or set of wireframes), getting it  really slick and modelling more and more of the intended interactions. This can  often be a mistake because you end up spending too much time and effort on a  prototype that is only going to be thrown away anyway. Unless the prototype  will become the production system (which I think is generally a bad idea  anyway) or it really needs to model every interaction in excruciating detail  (i.e. it’s bound for the off shore sausage factory) then don’t spend any more  time than is necessary on a prototype. Don’t forget that a prototype is only a  means to an end, not the end itself so think twice about exactly how much  detail and how polished it really needs and produce something that is <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/good-enough-design/\">good enough, but no  better</a>.</p><h2>9. Blindly copying other designs</h2><div id=\"attachment_1054\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\" alt=\"iPod rip off\" title=\"ipod-rip-off\" width=\"200\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1054\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Be wary of simply ripping off another design</p></div><p>An all too common UX mistake is to copy another design,  assuming that a great deal of thought, research and testing has gone into it.  Well of course this might have been the case, but usually it isn’t. By blinding  copying another design you might also be copying the same issues, problems and  short falls in that design. Whilst of course it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">utilise design  patterns</a> and to borrow the best bits from other designs you need to think  long and hard about how that design might perform and ideally put it to the  test. Something like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B  testing</a> is a great way to do this, or simply run the design by  some users and see how it fares.</p><h2>10. Not setting any UX standards and guidelines</h2><p>In the same way that it’s important to have building  standards in place to ensure that a building is built and maintained correctly,  it’s also a good idea to have UX standards and guidelines in place to ensure  that good UX design principles and practices are followed. Without these it’s all  too easy for <a href=\"http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/\">bad UX design</a> to  proliferate and for lots of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-design-consistency/\">inconsistencies to  creep into designs</a>. Of course having UX standards and guidelines that are overly  prescriptive or too exhaustive is also a mistake but it certainly makes sense  to have standards and guidelines that cover areas such as the design process to  follow (or at least loosely follow), design patterns to use, design principles  to adhere to and user feedback loops to incorporate.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://boltpeters.com/blog/ten-ux-mistakes/\">Top Ten UX Mistakes on  Consumer Websites (Bolt | Peters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://tibetantailor.com/?p=1027\">The  Top Ten Mistakes UX (User Experience) Leaders Make (TibetanTailor)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html\">Top  10 Mistakes in Web Design (Jakob Nielsen)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/01/09/user-experience-design/\">10 most common  misconceptions about user experience design (Whitney Hess)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=10%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/" (19991 10313) new 4 nil nil ((title nil "10 UX mistakes to avoid") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 08 Jul 2011 15:54:49 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "UX design") (category nil "UX strategy") (category nil "Mistakes") (category nil "Myths") (guid ((isPermaLink .

On one hand this makes a lot of sense because you obviously  want those people skilled in research carrying out the research and those  skilled in design carrying out the design. However I think that often doing  this means that a lot of the important research insight can get lost in  translation as one team communicates findings to the other. Research also  shouldn’t be carried out for its own sake and it’s important that any design research  is able to feed into and influence the ultimate design. This is why I would  advocate having the same team carrying out both the UX research and design. Of  course within that team you might have research and design specialists but you  want the continuity and know how that having the same team involved throughout  can bring.</p><h2>7. Jumping straight into design</h2><p>When considering a new product or website, or thinking about  how an existing one can be improved it can be very tempting to start designing  straight away. &quot;This is how this screen might work&quot;. &quot;This is what we should  have on the homepage&quot;. Whist it makes sense to certainly start thinking about  the design from the start it can be a mistake to jump in too early without  first considering the bigger picture and hopefully carrying out a bit of  research first. It might turn out for example that a feature you’ve spent  considerable time designing isn’t in tune with how users want to work, or even  worse might not even be required in the first place!</p><h2>8. Creating overly elaborate prototypes and wireframes</h2><p>With increasingly powerful rapid prototyping and wireframing  tools out there, such as <a href=\"http://www.axure.com/\">Axure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/\">Omnigraffle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/SketchFlow_Overview.aspx\">Microsoft  Sketchflow</a> it can be tempting to spend lots of time on an elaborate pixel  perfect (or close to) version of a prototype (or set of wireframes), getting it  really slick and modelling more and more of the intended interactions. This can  often be a mistake because you end up spending too much time and effort on a  prototype that is only going to be thrown away anyway. Unless the prototype  will become the production system (which I think is generally a bad idea  anyway) or it really needs to model every interaction in excruciating detail  (i.e. it’s bound for the off shore sausage factory) then don’t spend any more  time than is necessary on a prototype. Don’t forget that a prototype is only a  means to an end, not the end itself so think twice about exactly how much  detail and how polished it really needs and produce something that is <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/good-enough-design/\">good enough, but no  better</a>.</p><h2>9. Blindly copying other designs</h2><div id=\"attachment_1054\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ipod-rip-off.jpg\" alt=\"iPod rip off\" title=\"ipod-rip-off\" width=\"200\" height=\"203\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1054\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Be wary of simply ripping off another design</p></div><p>An all too common UX mistake is to copy another design,  assuming that a great deal of thought, research and testing has gone into it.  Well of course this might have been the case, but usually it isn’t. By blinding  copying another design you might also be copying the same issues, problems and  short falls in that design. Whilst of course it makes sense to <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">utilise design  patterns</a> and to borrow the best bits from other designs you need to think  long and hard about how that design might perform and ideally put it to the  test. Something like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B  testing</a> is a great way to do this, or simply run the design by  some users and see how it fares.</p><h2>10. Not setting any UX standards and guidelines</h2><p>In the same way that it’s important to have building  standards in place to ensure that a building is built and maintained correctly,  it’s also a good idea to have UX standards and guidelines in place to ensure  that good UX design principles and practices are followed. Without these it’s all  too easy for <a href=\"http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/\">bad UX design</a> to  proliferate and for lots of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-design-consistency/\">inconsistencies to  creep into designs</a>. Of course having UX standards and guidelines that are overly  prescriptive or too exhaustive is also a mistake but it certainly makes sense  to have standards and guidelines that cover areas such as the design process to  follow (or at least loosely follow), design patterns to use, design principles  to adhere to and user feedback loops to incorporate.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://boltpeters.com/blog/ten-ux-mistakes/\">Top Ten UX Mistakes on  Consumer Websites (Bolt | Peters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://tibetantailor.com/?p=1027\">The  Top Ten Mistakes UX (User Experience) Leaders Make (TibetanTailor)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html\">Top  10 Mistakes in Web Design (Jakob Nielsen)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2009/01/09/user-experience-design/\">10 most common  misconceptions about user experience design (Whitney Hess)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fux-mistakes%2F&amp;title=10%20UX%20mistakes%20to%20avoid\" id=\"wpa2a_8\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/ux-mistakes/feed/") (slash:comments nil "0"))) ("Say it with a word cloud" "<p>Word clouds (also known as text clouds and tag clouds) are  not just a cool way to show a bunch of tags they are also a great way to visually  communicate all sorts of UX related information, from user stories to search  keywords.

In this article I outline some  hints, tips and best practice guidelines for improving the usability (and resulting  conversion rate) of your forms.</p><h2>Form design</h2><h3>Keep forms as short and simple as possible</h3><p>A good rule of thumb when it comes to form design is to try  to keep your forms as short and simple as possible, but no simpler. Try to  remove any unnecessary questions and try to simplify complex questions as much  as possible. A good way to do this is to run through the form and ask yourself,  “Do we really need to capture this information?”. If the answer is ‘probably  not’ then resolve to remove that item from the form.</p><h3>Don’t make users think any more than they have to</h3><p>Ask me the month and year I bought my last car and I could  probably tell you. Ask me the exact date and I wouldn’t have a clue. Try not to  make users think any more than they have to when filling out your form by  ensuring that questions are clear, unambiguous and as easy to answer as  possible (unless of course you’re designing a quiz). For each step of the form  ask yourself “Is it clear what users need to do and will they be able to do  it?”. If the answer is no then you’ll need to change that part of the form.</p><h3>Make forms as standard as possible</h3><p>Your users will have filled out countless forms prior to yours  so it makes sense to try to make your form as standard as possible. This means  using existing form design patterns, such as a recognised address format, postcode  look up and error reporting (checkout my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/design-patterns-search/\">design patterns  search</a> for an easy way to find form design patterns). Designing a form that  is unlike any other might make for a very interesting design but is likely to  leave your users scratching their heads.</p><h3>Let users know what to expect</h3><p>For many forms it’s important to let users know what is in  store for them, such as how long the form is likely to take and what sort of  information they will need to hand. After all, you don’t want users getting  half way through your form only to realise that they don’t have all the  information that’s required.</p><h2>Form layout</h2><h3>Break complex forms up into bite size chunks</h3><p>For more complex forms it’s often a mistake to try to do too  much on the one page, or the one form. Instead consider breaking up the form  into bit size chunks, much in the same way that most online checkouts are  broken down in to steps (delivery address, billing address, payment etc…). Make  sure that sections are clearly labelled and that related information, such as  delivery details are captured together. </p><h3>Show the user’s progress</h3><p>For longer forms it’s important to let users know where they  are in the form and how much further they have to go. This might be as simple  as outlining the step they are currently on (e.g. step 1 of 4), displaying the  percentage complete or displaying a progress bar showing the steps completed  and the steps still to go.</p><h3>Make forms easier to scan</h3><p>Make your form easy for users to quickly scan by using white  space, headers and other graphical elements to clearly differentiate form  sections. Headings should be descriptive, succinct and should stand out on the  page so that users can quickly see what information they need to enter. </p><h3>Utilise progressive disclosure</h3><p>For complex forms it can be confusing and potentially  overwhelming for users to show all the inputs straight away. Instead it’s a  good idea to progressively disclose form elements so that they are revealed  only if and when required and within context. For example, if a drop down has  an ‘other’ option which requires entry into a text field, it’s a good idea to  only show that text field when ‘other’ has been selected.<strong></strong></p><h2>Labels</h2><h3>Use the user’s terms and names</h3><p>It’s important when considering labels that names and terms  are used that users will understand and recognise. Try to avoid using your own  terms as something that might make sense to you might not make sense to your  users.</p><h3>Use succinct and descriptive labels</h3><p>Form labels should be short, clear and descriptive. If extra  information, clarification or context is required use help text to do this  rather than long rambling labels.</p><h3>Place labels next to inputs</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2006/07/label-placement-in-forms.php\">Eye  tracking studies</a> have shown that placing labels next to inputs (e.g. above or to the left – i.e. right aligned) make it easiest for users to read and  associate labels with fields (taking advantage of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology\">Gestalt law of proximity</a>).</p><h3>Distinguish required and optional inputs</h3><p>It’s important to distinguish the required inputs on a form  so that users know what information that they must enter. The standard  convention is to use a ‘*’ to distinguish required fields. For example, ‘Name  *’. Don’t forget to also include text at the top of each form page stating that  the asterisk signifies a required field. </p><p>  If most of the fields on a form  are required with just 1 or 2 optional then it often makes more sense to  highlight optional fields, rather than required fields. A good way to do this  is to append the labels for optional inputs with ‘(optional)’, such as ‘Mobile  number (optional)’. Short forms, such as a password reset form might have all  fields required, in which case it’s usually not necessary to highlight required  fields.</p><h2>Inputs</h2><h3>Use appropriate inputs</h3><p>It’s important to choose the right sort of input for the  information being captured. For example, radio buttons are a good idea where a  small number (e.g. 2-6) of mutually exclusive options are available (i.e. only  one can be selected), whereas a dropdown is more appropriate where a larger  number of options are available (or where space is an issue). The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511482.aspx\">Microsoft Windows  UX guide</a> has a really good run down of many of the different input controls  available and their appropriate usage.</p><p>The length of text fields should also reflect the format and  expected length of text input. Short inputs such as postcodes should have a  short text box, where as longer inputs, such as email addresses should have a  larger text box. A good way to test that appropriate sizes have been used is to  go through your form entering some expected values. Text boxes should be large  enough to show most if not all of the text entered.</p><h3>Have a logical order of inputs</h3><p>Your form should have a logical order of entry. It would be  most unusual for example to ask users for their address and then their name, as  it’s usually the other way around. It’s also a good idea to group related  inputs so that users are entering related information in the one place. For  example, you might group contact information together (name, email address,  telephone number etc…) or preferences together. For larger forms inputs might  be grouped into clear sections with headings.</p><h3>Use smart defaults where appropriate</h3><p>Smart defaults simply mean that inputs are set to a sensible initial value so that a significant proportion of your users don’t have to do anything. For  example, if most of your users come from the UK and you have a country select dropdown, it might be a good idea to default the country to ‘UK’ (or at least  have it at the top of the dropdown).</p><p>Smart defaults can be really useful but be mindful of users  inadvertently submitting default values because they don’t realise that a  value has already been selected.</p><h3>Consider the order and grouping of options</h3><p>Where multiple options are available for users it’s  important to consider the best order in which to list them and whether grouping  options would make sense. For shorter lists it’s usually best to order by  estimated popularity, with the most likely to be chosen option first and so on.  Longer lists (e.g. country select) are usually best ordered alphabetically or  grouped, for example using the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/H85.html\">OPTGROUP  element to group options within a dropdown</a>.</p><h3>Be flexible about formatting</h3><p>Try not to be too picky about how users enter information  into your form as there is nothing more annoying than a form that requires  information to be entered in a very specific format. For example, if you’re  asking for a date the form should ideally be able to accept both shorthand  (e.g. 11/5/11 – in the UK, 5/11/11 in the US) and long hand versions (e.g.  11/5/2011 – in the UK, 5/11/2011 in the US). </p><h3>Allow users to tab through inputs</h3><p>Many users will utilise the Tab key to move between inputs  on a form as it can be much quicker than moving the cursor to the next input  with the mouse. It’s therefore a good idea to check that tabbing between inputs  is possible for your form and that inputs are tabbed in a logical order. The <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_tabindex.asp\">TABINDEX element</a> can be used to specify tabbing order within a web form if the default order  is all over the place.</p><h2>Help</h2><h3>Address common user queries and questions</h3><p>Users are bound to have lots of queries and questions when  it comes to filling out your form. What does this refer to? Why am I being  asked for this information? Hopefully you’ve captured some of these during <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-testing/\">usability testing</a> but even if you’ve not yet carried out any usability testing you can still probably  have a good guess at some of the queries that might crop up.</p><p>  A good way to address common user  queries and question is to show some help text when an input has focus. You  won’t need to include help text for every input, just those where users might  need a little help or clarification. Help text should be short and clear. If a  user might need extra help then it’s usually better to link to more  information, or to include some additional FAQs, rather than overload the form  with help text. <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/\">MoneySupermarket.com’s</a> car insurance quote form (as shown below) is a really good example of  addressing common user queries using on focus help text and FAQs.</p><div id=\"attachment_932\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/moneysupermarket-form-example.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/moneysupermarket-form-example.png\" alt=\"Moneysupermarket form example\" title=\"Moneysupermarket form example\" width=\"728\" height=\"465\" class=\"size-full wp-image-932\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moneysupermarket.com  addresses common user queries and questions for it’s car insurance  quote form by using on focus help and FAQs.</p></div><h3>Keep help text succinct and easy to understand</h3><p>Whenever writing help text for a form it’s important to  keep it as succinct and as easy to understand as possible. After all, users won’t  want to have to read an essay to work out how to fill out your form. Help text  should be written in <a href=\"http://www.plainlanguage.gov/whatisPL/index.cfm\">plain English</a>,  avoiding the use of jargon and gobbledygook (love that word). Terms used should obviously also be ones that users will understand.</p><h2>Errors</h2><h3>Highlight all errors</h3><p>If there are errors on the form following an attempted  submission then these should all be reported, ideally with each input at fault  also individually highlighted. A good way to do this is to show error messages  at the top of the page listing all the errors and then show additional error  messages above or below the inputs at fault. It’s important not to just report  the first input with an error because there might be others that need fixing  and you will want your users to hopefully fix all their errors  before re-submitting the form.</p><h3>Use clear, actionable error messages </h3><p>Error messages should be clear and actionable. For example,  don’t just report that there is some information missing, state what that  information is. Similarly don’t just report that an input is not in the correct  format, outline what the format should be. It’s important that users not only  know why an error has been reported but also how they can fix it. </p><h3>Utilise real-time validation</h3><p>For some inputs it can be a good idea to utilise real-time  validation, perhaps using JavaScript or AJAX to validate inputs prior to  submission. For example you might check that an input is in the correct format,  that a user name has not already been used or that two email addresses entered  are exactly the same.</p><h2>Actions</h2><h3>Make primary call to actions clear</h3><p>Primary calls to action on the form, such ‘Next’ or ‘Submit’  should be clear and should ideally stand out on the page. A good way to do this  is to make the primary action a button and other actions, such as ‘Back’ or  ‘Cancel’ links. Alternatively you could use a different colour or visual  styling for the primary call to action button.</p><h3>Provide feedback to users</h3><p>It’s important to provide users with feedback following an  action. For example, you should provide feedback following submission of the  form or during some sort of lookup. For operations that can take a little while  the now ubiquitous swirling circle is a good way to show that something is  happening, or alternatively showing a progress bar or percentage complete. Let  users know whether their action was successful or not and what their next steps  are. If their action was unsuccessful don’t forget to outline why this was and  what the user can do about it.</p><h3>Make reusable and very complex forms saveable</h3><p>It’s a really good idea to make very complex or very long forms,  such as job application forms saveable, so that users can save their progress  (or have it automatically saved for them) and return to their form at a later  date. The same also applies to reusable forms. These are forms where users are  likely to need to retrieve, edit and resubmit their form at some point in the  future. Insurance quote forms are a good example of reusable forms.</p><h3>Avoid including a reset button (unless having one makes sense) </h3><p>You still see an awful lot of reset / clear buttons on web  forms these days, usually tantalisingly close to the ‘Submit’ button so that a  user can easily inadvertently clear their form rather than submitting it. Unless  users are likely to need to be able to reset their entire form, such as for  search filter or advanced search forms resist the temptation to include a reset  button – 9 times of out 10 it’s a potential hindrance rather than being  helpful.</p><h2>Other considerations</h2><h3>Make forms accessible</h3><p>Making sure that your form is as accessible as possible is a  no-brainer because it opens it up to the largest audience possible. Usability  and accessibility also go hand in hand as usually the more accessible a form  is, the more usable it is as well. I’ve listed some useful articles for making  forms accessible in the related articles section as making forms accessible is  a substantial topic in its own right.</p><h3>Carry out usability testing</h3><p>As they say the proof is in the pudding – how can you tell  how usable a form is without testing it with real users? Ideally you should be  carrying out <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-testing/\">moderated  usability testing</a>, either face-to-face or remotely using a screen sharing  tool (checkout my list of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/free-ux-tools/\">25  great free UX tools</a> for a few free ones you could use). If getting time  with users is likely to be very difficult then you could also carry out unmoderated  remote usability testing using a tool using as <a href=\"http://www.loop11.com/\">Loop11</a> (take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/presentations/\">remote  user testing 101 presentation</a> for more about remote usability testing).</p><p>You don’t even need a working form to carry out usability  testing. You could carry out some early <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/sketching/\">paper prototyping</a> to test  out sketches or rudimentary mock-ups of your form, or put together a <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/\">rapid prototype</a> using one of the many rapid prototyping tools out there.</p><h3>Set-up and track form analytics</h3><p>Once a form is actually being used in the big bad world you’ll  want to see how users are fairing and whether it’s performing as expected.  Capturing live usage data using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google analytics</a> allows you to  monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates and drop out  rates and to capture important information such as common form submissions  errors (e.g. missing fields) and common user journeys in and out of the form.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.formsthatwork.com/\">Forms that work: Designing web forms for usability (Caroline Jarrett)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp\">Web Form Design:  Filling in the Blanks (Luke Wroblewski)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sensibleforms\">Sensible Forms: A Form  Usability Checklist (Brian Crescimanno)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/04/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms/\">Web  Form Design Patterns: Sign-Up Forms (Smashing Magazine)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/\">Creating  accessible forms (WebAIM)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.websemantics.co.uk/tutorials/accessible_forms/\">Accessible  forms: Guidelines, examples and accessible JavaScript tricks (webSemantics)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fforms-usability%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20improve%20the%20usability%20%28and%20conversion%20rate%29%20of%20your%20forms\" id=\"wpa2a_12\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/forms-usability/" (19922 40224) new 6 nil nil ((title nil "How to improve the usability (and conversion rate) of your forms") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/forms-usability/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/forms-usability/#comments") (pubDate nil "Tue, 17 May 2011 16:06:56 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "Usability & user research") (category nil "UX design") (category nil "Design principles") (category nil "Forms") (guid ((isPermaLink .

In this article I outline some  hints, tips and best practice guidelines for improving the usability (and resulting  conversion rate) of your forms.</p><h2>Form design</h2><h3>Keep forms as short and simple as possible</h3><p>A good rule of thumb when it comes to form design is to try  to keep your forms as short and simple as possible, but no simpler. Try to  remove any unnecessary questions and try to simplify complex questions as much  as possible. A good way to do this is to run through the form and ask yourself,  “Do we really need to capture this information?”. If the answer is ‘probably  not’ then resolve to remove that item from the form.</p><h3>Don’t make users think any more than they have to</h3><p>Ask me the month and year I bought my last car and I could  probably tell you. Ask me the exact date and I wouldn’t have a clue. Try not to  make users think any more than they have to when filling out your form by  ensuring that questions are clear, unambiguous and as easy to answer as  possible (unless of course you’re designing a quiz). For each step of the form  ask yourself “Is it clear what users need to do and will they be able to do  it?”. If the answer is no then you’ll need to change that part of the form.</p><h3>Make forms as standard as possible</h3><p>Your users will have filled out countless forms prior to yours  so it makes sense to try to make your form as standard as possible.

Let  users know whether their action was successful or not and what their next steps  are. If their action was unsuccessful don’t forget to outline why this was and  what the user can do about it.</p><h3>Make reusable and very complex forms saveable</h3><p>It’s a really good idea to make very complex or very long forms,  such as job application forms saveable, so that users can save their progress  (or have it automatically saved for them) and return to their form at a later  date. The same also applies to reusable forms. These are forms where users are  likely to need to retrieve, edit and resubmit their form at some point in the  future. Insurance quote forms are a good example of reusable forms.</p><h3>Avoid including a reset button (unless having one makes sense) </h3><p>You still see an awful lot of reset / clear buttons on web  forms these days, usually tantalisingly close to the ‘Submit’ button so that a  user can easily inadvertently clear their form rather than submitting it. Unless  users are likely to need to be able to reset their entire form, such as for  search filter or advanced search forms resist the temptation to include a reset  button &#8211; 9 times of out 10 it’s a potential hindrance rather than being  helpful.</p><h2>Other considerations</h2><h3>Make forms accessible</h3><p>Making sure that your form is as accessible as possible is a  no-brainer because it opens it up to the largest audience possible. Usability  and accessibility also go hand in hand as usually the more accessible a form  is, the more usable it is as well. I’ve listed some useful articles for making  forms accessible in the related articles section as making forms accessible is  a substantial topic in its own right.</p><h3>Carry out usability testing</h3><p>As they say the proof is in the pudding – how can you tell  how usable a form is without testing it with real users? Ideally you should be  carrying out <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-testing/\">moderated  usability testing</a>, either face-to-face or remotely using a screen sharing  tool (checkout my list of <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/free-ux-tools/\">25  great free UX tools</a> for a few free ones you could use). If getting time  with users is likely to be very difficult then you could also carry out unmoderated  remote usability testing using a tool using as <a href=\"http://www.loop11.com/\">Loop11</a> (take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/presentations/\">remote  user testing 101 presentation</a> for more about remote usability testing).</p><p>You don’t even need a working form to carry out usability  testing. You could carry out some early <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/sketching/\">paper prototyping</a> to test  out sketches or rudimentary mock-ups of your form, or put together a <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/rapid-prototyping/\">rapid prototype</a> using one of the many rapid prototyping tools out there.</p><h3>Set-up and track form analytics</h3><p>Once a form is actually being used in the big bad world you’ll  want to see how users are fairing and whether it’s performing as expected.  Capturing live usage data using a tool such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google analytics</a> allows you to  monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates and drop out  rates and to capture important information such as common form submissions  errors (e.g. missing fields) and common user journeys in and out of the form.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.formsthatwork.com/\">Forms that work: Designing web forms for usability (Caroline Jarrett)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.lukew.com/resources/web_form_design.asp\">Web Form Design:  Filling in the Blanks (Luke Wroblewski)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sensibleforms\">Sensible Forms: A Form  Usability Checklist (Brian Crescimanno)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/04/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms/\">Web  Form Design Patterns: Sign-Up Forms (Smashing Magazine)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/forms/\">Creating  accessible forms (WebAIM)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.websemantics.co.uk/tutorials/accessible_forms/\">Accessible  forms: Guidelines, examples and accessible JavaScript tricks (webSemantics)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fforms-usability%2F&amp;title=How%20to%20improve%20the%20usability%20%28and%20conversion%20rate%29%20of%20your%20forms\" id=\"wpa2a_12\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/forms-usability/feed/") (slash:comments nil "9"))) ("15 useful user feedback questions for online surveys" "<p>Online surveys are a quick and incredibly useful tool for  gathering all sorts of user feedback. In next to no time you can whip something  up using one of the many online survey tools out there (I particularly  recommend <a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/\">SurveyGizmo</a>) and start  gathering feedback from real users. Often implementing the survey is the easy  bit, it’s designing the thing that’s the tricky part as you won’t get the  feedback you’re after if you don’t ask the right questions. In this article I  outline 15 useful user feedback questions for online surveys for you to pick and choose  from.</p><h3>1. Would you recommend &lt;website / product&gt; to a friend? </h3><p>This is a great way to find out what users’ opinion of a  website or product is. After all, someone is unlikely to recommend something  that they don’t rate themselves. Rather than just capturing a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’  response consider providing ‘<strong>Yes, I’d  recommend it because…</strong>’ and ‘<strong>No, I  wouldn’t recommend it because…</strong>’ as possible answers with text boxes below  each (or show the relevant text box on answer) so that you can also find out  why users would or would not recommend it.</p><h3>2. How would you describe &lt;website / product&gt; in one or more words?</h3><p>This is a good question for capturing perceptions of a website  or product. You could allow users to enter their own words or chose one or more  from a list, such as the 118 used in <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Miscrosoft-Product-Reaction-Cards.doc\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft’s  product reaction cards (Word)</a>. A good way to analyse the results of  this question is to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud\">word  cloud</a> generated using a service such as <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\">Wordle</a>.</p><h3>3. If &lt;website / product&gt; were a car, what car would it be?</h3><p>A bit of a wacky one but by asking users to compare your  website or product to something else you can investigate their perceptions of  it. For example, do they compare it to a beautiful and desirable <a href=\"http://www.astonmartin.com/eng/thecars/db9\">Aston Martin DB9</a> or a  bland and boring <a href=\"http://www.toyota.com/corolla/\">Toyota Corolla</a> (sorry Corolla drivers out there)?</p><h3>4. How does &lt;website / product&gt; compare to &lt;competitor&gt;?</h3><p>A great way to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of a  website or product is to ask users to compare it to something similar that they  have used. In addition to asking how the two compare you might also ask ‘<strong>Which do you prefer?</strong>’ to find out more  definitively how your website or product stacks up to the competition.</p><h3>5. If you were to review &lt;website / product&gt; what score would you  give it out of 10?</h3><p>With most online shoppers being familiar with customer  reviews and ratings why not ask users to review your website or product? You  could ask for an overall rating or ask them to rate specific areas. I prefer to  use a 10 point score rather than 5 point because it gives participants more  flexibility. It’s also a good idea to ask ‘<strong>Why  have you given this score?</strong>’ so that you find out the rationale for a  rating.</p><h3>6. What do you find most frustrating about &lt;website / product&gt;?</h3><p>A lot of websites and products focus on pilling on more and  more features, rather than ensuring that existing features work really well.  Asking what currently frustrates users is a great way to investigate how  existing features can be improved. You can ask what users find most frustrating  or alternatively ask for their top 3 frustrations.</p><h3>7. Overall, how easy to use do you find &lt;website / product&gt;? </h3><p>Standard usability questionnaires such as <a href=\"http://oldwww.acm.org/perlman/question.cgi\">CSUQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SUS-System-Usability-Scale.doc\" target=\"_blank\">SUS</a> and <a href=\"http://lap.umd.edu/quis/\">QUIS</a> are really good for evaluating the  usability of a website or product but can be quite lengthy. This is a good  single question for investigating the usability of a product or service.  Possible answers could be ‘Very easy to use’; ‘Easy to use’; ‘Neither easy nor  difficult to use’; ‘Difficult to use’ and ‘Very difficult to use’. Also  consider asking ‘<strong>Why is this?</strong>’ if a  user selects either ‘Difficult to use’ or ‘Very difficult to use’ so that you  can investigate the reasons behind this a little further.</p><h3>8. Why have you come to &lt;website&gt;?</h3><p>Even with analytics it can be difficult to work out what users  are coming to your website for. Is it to find out some information; to carry  out a transaction or something you’ve not even considered? In addition to  asking why users have come to your website you might also want to ask ‘<strong>Were you successful?</strong>’ and ‘<strong>What problems did you experience</strong>’. This  allows you to also investigate how well the website supported someone’s goal or  task.<strong></strong></p><h3>9. If you could change one thing about &lt;website / product&gt; what would  it be and why?</h3><p>This is a great question for unearthing major frustrations  or feature omissions. Asking for one thing forces users to consider what is  most important to them. You could alternatively ask for up to three things that  someone would like to change.</p><h3>10. What features could you not live without?</h3><p>This is a good question for investigating killer features.  Analytics will often tell you which features are most popular but not  necessarily which are most important to users. </p><h3>11. What do you like best about &lt;website / product&gt;? </h3><p>Along with finding out what needs to be improved about a  website or product, don’t forget to also find out what currently works really  well. After all, you don’t want to inadvertently change something that users  currently really like.</p><h3>12. What do you like least about &lt;website / product&gt;?</h3><p>A good complement to asking what users like best about a  website or product. For this question you could either ask what users like or alternatively  ask for their top 3 dislikes.</p><h3>13. Which features could you live without?</h3><p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/\">37signals</a> in their  rather splendid book <a href=\"http://gettingreal.37signals.com/\">Getting Real</a> (which incidentally can be read online for free – whoopee) state that when it  comes to feature selection, “<em>More isn’t the  answer. Sometimes the biggest favour you can do for customers is to leave  something out</em>”. I couldn’t’ agree more which is why it can be a really good  idea to find out which features might be pruned from your website or product.</p><h3>14. How can we improve &lt;website / product&gt;? Send us your ideas and  suggestions.</h3><p>This is a great question for getting general user feedback, together  with feature ideas and suggestions. You might even want to think about setting  up a follow up customer feedback forum, using a service such as <a href=\"http://uservoice.com/\">Uservoice</a>. This allows users to vote on ideas  and suggestions that have been submitted so hopefully you can find out which is  likely to be most popular.</p><h3>15. Anything else you care to share or get off your chest?</h3><p>This is a great last question as it gives users the  opportunity to sound off about anything the survey may have missed and makes it  clear that you’re interested in listening to them (just don’t take any rants  too personally).</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/04/the-three-greatest-survey-questions-ever.html\">The  Three Greatest Survey Questions Ever (Avinash Kaushik)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~tomtullis/publications/UPA2004TullisStetson.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A  Comparison of Questionnaires for Assessing Website Usability (PDF)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://lap.umd.edu/quis/\">QUIS – Questionnaire for User Interaction  Satisfaction</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SUS-System-Usability-Scale.doc\" target=\"_blank\">SUS –  System Usability Scale (Word)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://oldwww.acm.org/perlman/question.cgi\">CSUQ – Computer System  Usability Questionnaire</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fonline-survey-questions%2F&amp;title=15%20useful%20user%20feedback%20questions%20for%20online%20surveys\" id=\"wpa2a_14\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/online-survey-questions/" (19869 54130) new 7 nil nil ((title nil "15 useful user feedback questions for online surveys") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/online-survey-questions/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/online-survey-questions/#comments") (pubDate nil "Thu, 07 Apr 2011 15:08:34 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "Usability & user research") (category nil "UX tools & techniques") (category nil "Requirements") (category nil "Surveys") (category nil "User research") (guid ((isPermaLink .

It comes with a  good set of built-in widgets covering web, windows and sketchy UI components  and allows pages to be exported as HTML, a PDF, an Open Office doc, a Word Doc  or an image.<br /><a href=\"http://pencil.evolus.vn/en-US/Home.aspx\">http://pencil.evolus.vn</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_873\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Pencil-sketching.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Pencil-sketching.png\" alt=\"Pencil – A free prototyping and diagramming tool\" title=\"Pencil – A free prototyping and diagramming tool\" width=\"728\" height=\"569\" class=\"size-full wp-image-873\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pencil – A free prototyping and diagramming tool</p></div></p><h3>LucidChart</h3><p>LucidChart is an online tool for creating diagrams, UI  mockups and prototypes. It allows more than one person to collaborate on a  document and comes with a nice set of built-in widgets, including UI  components, icons and diagramming shapes. Although it’s not strictly speaking  free it does allow documents to be created with up to 60 elements and with two  collaborators for free.

Mind maps can be imported from other mind mapping  applications such as <a href=\"http://www.mindjet.com/\">MindManger</a> and <a href=\"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/\">Freemind</a> and can be exported or  shared with others by uploading them to the <a href=\"http://www.xmind.net/\">XMind  website</a>. <br /><a href=\"http://www.xmind.net/\">http://www.xmind.net</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_892\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/XMind.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/XMind.png\" alt=\"XMind – A mind mapping tool with a free version\" title=\"XMind – A mind mapping tool with a free version\" width=\"728\" height=\"569\" class=\"size-full wp-image-892\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">XMind – A mind mapping tool with a free version</p></div></p><h3>Freemind</h3><p>Freemind is an Open Source mind mapping tool that’s really  useful for creating clickable HTML sitemaps. It’s not as slick as some of the  other mind mapping tools out there but is very quick to use and has more  features than the free edition of <a href=\"http://www.xmind.net/\">XMind</a>. <br /><a href=\"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/\">http://freemind.sourceforge.net</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_893\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Freemind.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Freemind.png\" alt=\"Freemind – A free mind mapping tool\" title=\"Freemind – A free mind mapping tool\" width=\"728\" height=\"569\" class=\"size-full wp-image-893\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Freemind – A free mind mapping tool</p></div></p><h2>Usability testing tools</h2><h3>CamStudio</h3><p>CamStudio is an Open Source application that allows you to  record what’s going on onscreen, including audio from a microphone or the  computer speakers.

Unfortunately participants do need to install the Skype  client on their computer and it won’t record sessions like <a href=\"http://www.webex.com/\">WebEx</a>, but then you can always use something  like <a href=\"http://camstudio.org/\">CamStudio</a> to do this. <br /><a href=\"http://www.skype.com/\">http://www.skype.com</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_895\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 670px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Skype.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Skype.jpg\" alt=\"Skype – A screen sharing tool with a free version\" title=\"Skype – A screen sharing tool with a free version\" width=\"660\" height=\"416\" class=\"size-full wp-image-895\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Skype – A screen sharing tool with a free version</p></div></p><h3>Loop11</h3><p>Loop11 is a great tool for carrying out <a href=\"http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/01/unmoderated-remote-usability-testing-good-or-evil.php\">unmoderated  usability testing</a>.

You can have one or more designs, in the form of images and then people are able to  view them for 5 seconds before entering some feedback. <br /><a href=\"http://www.fivesecondtest.com/\">http://www.fivesecondtest.com</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_897\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/FiveSecondTest.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/FiveSecondTest.png\" alt=\"Five Second Test – A free remote usability testing tool\" title=\"Five Second Test – A free remote usability testing tool\" width=\"728\" height=\"582\" class=\"size-full wp-image-897\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Five Second Test – A free remote usability testing tool</p></div></p><h3>Survey Monkey</h3><p>SurveyMonkey is an online survey tool that’s great for  carrying out online surveys, or for capturing feedback following usability  testing. The free version allows you to set-up surveys with up to10 questions  and 100 responses, which is generally plenty.<br /><a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/\">http://www.surveymonkey.com</a><br /><div id=\"attachment_898\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/SurveyMonkey.png\"><img src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/SurveyMonkey.png\" alt=\"SurveyMonkey – An online survey tool with a free version\" title=\"SurveyMonkey – An online survey tool with a free version\" width=\"728\" height=\"652\" class=\"size-full wp-image-898\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SurveyMonkey – An online survey tool with a free version</p></div></p><h2>Usability reviewing tools</h2><h3>Concept feedback</h3><p>Concept Feedback is an interesting tool for getting second  opinions on a design.

Well I won’t deny that it helps (spoken like a true expert!) but since user experience certainly isn’t rocket science anyone can have a good stab at carrying out a usability review and learn a great deal in the process. In this article I walkthrough a method for examining the usability of an interactive system (website, application, mobile app etc.)  by using a combination of a scenario based and heuristic (i.e. best practice guidelines) based review. I also discuss when usability reviews are most useful and outline some of the pros and cons of the technique.</p><h2>What are usability reviews?</h2><p>Usability reviews are a structured means of examining the usability of an interactive system by evaluating it against a set of recognised usability best practice principles. Reviews are usually carried out by usability experts, but don’t let that put you off carrying out your own because with a bit of know how and a good set of guidelines anyone can have a go.</p><p>Broadly speaking there are two different types of usability review – scenario based reviews and heuristic based reviews. Scenario based reviews evaluate a system against likely user scenarios, such as buying a product for an ecommerce website. Heuristic reviews on the other hand evaluate an interface against a set of usability heuristics (i.e. best practice), such as links being clear, descriptive and well labelled. The two are by no means mutually exclusive and are often most effective when used together (as you will see).</p><h2>Usability reviews – the good news</h2><p>Usability reviews have a lot going for them as a usability technique, including:</p><ul><li>Usability reviews are <strong>quick and cheap to carry out</strong>. A comprehensive usability review can often be carried in just one or two days.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can be carried out by relative novices</strong> (provided that they have received at least some training in the technique and have a good set of guidelines to follow).</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can have a 	wide scope</strong>. Whereas usability testing generally evaluates a few specific tasks, usability reviews can quickly cover lots of different functions, usage scenarios and usability areas for a system.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>are great for competitive benchmarking</strong>. Different systems can be easily compared against the same usability criteria.</li></ul><h2>Usability reviews – the bad news</h2><p>Alas it’s not all good news. Usability reviews also have a number of short comings that you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Usability reviews don’t 	actually tell you how usable a system is, </strong>just how usable it should be.

I’ve found that using the two techniques together works really well because it means that lots of bases are covered and ensures that a system is evaluated against likely usage. Carrying out the cognitive walkthrough first also helps builds up a good understanding of the system prior to the heuristic based review. Want to know more? Here’s how to carry out a comprehensive usability review.</p><h3>1. Define your usability review scenarios</h3><p>A cognitive walkthrough provides a means of evaluating the usability of a system by testing how well it supports a common user task in the form of a <a href=\"../../scenario-mapping/\">scenario</a>. You basically take a scenario, such as a punter placing a bet on a betting website, and walk through the steps that this user might take to achieve their goal. To do this you should first define some user scenarios to walkthrough. These should cover common and important user tasks that are crucial to the success of the system. For example, if you were evaluating a mobile phone you might look at adding a new contact; sending a text message and making a phone call as just some of the user scenarios to review. For each scenario you should answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Who </strong>is using the system? Has he or she used it before? You don’t need to build a rich <a href=\"../../personas/\">persona</a> for your user, just enough information to start making educated guesses about their behaviour.</li><li><strong>What </strong>is he or she trying to do? What task is he or she attempting to undertake? Is this the first time this person has attempted this task?</li><li><strong>Why</strong> is he or she using the system? What is their goal?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> is he or she using 	the system?  If a website is being reviewed, which browser is this person likely to use?</li></ul><p>The number of scenarios you review will depend on how extensive the usability review needs to be, and how wide the scope of the system is. For most reviews you’ll find that you will only probably need to cover 2-5 scenarios. It’s also a good idea to cover multiple scenarios with the same persona wherever possible.</p><h3>2. Walkthrough each scenario</h3><p>Having defined each scenario you’ll now need to walkthrough the steps that your persona is likely to take to achieve their goal. Of course it’s impossible to know exactly how someone will undertake a task so this is very much a best guess based on asking the following questions at each step:</p><ol><li><strong>Will the user know what to do?<br /></strong>Is there a clear route for the user to take? Is it obvious what the user needs to do at this step?</li><li><strong>Will the user see how to do it?<br /></strong>Is the call to action obvious?<strong></strong>Is it clear how the 	user completes this step?</li><li><strong>Will the user know whether their action was correct?<br /></strong>What sort of feedback is provided? Is it clear whether the user is on the correct path or not?</li></ol><p>You should continue the walkthrough for each scenario until you think the user is likely to have achieved their goal, or conversely is likely to have given up. Exactly how you capture each walkthrough is of course up to you. In the past I’ve found using a separate screenshot on each page with the above questions (Will the user know what to do? etc…) and answers for each step a good template to use.</p><h3>3. Fill out the usability review scorecard</h3><p>Having carried out a walkthrough for each scenario you should now be in a good position to carry out a heuristic review. Rather than using <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html\">Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics</a> I’ve found it easier to use more explicit usability heuristics based on usability best practice principles, such as making sure that error messages are descriptive and written in plain English. Nielsen’s usability heuristics are certainly useful and are something to keep in mind when carrying out a usability review but I find that they can be somewhat subjective and that less experienced reviewers can struggle to directly apply them. More explicit usability heuristics are more transparent, making it easier to see the link between a system and it’s judged usability, and are easier for less experienced reviewers to follow.</p><p>To carry out the heuristic part of the usability review simply download the Excel template below and you enter a score (very poor, poor, moderate, good etc…) and comments for each of the 45 best practice usability principles. The principles cover:</p><ul><li>Features and functionality</li><li>Homepage / starting page</li><li>Navigation</li><li>Search</li><li>Feedback</li><li>Forms</li><li>Errors</li><li>Content &amp; text</li><li>Help</li><li>Performance (e.g. response rate and absence of crashing)</li></ul><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"excel-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.xls\" target=\"new\">Usability review template (Excel, 100KB)</a></li></ul><p>The scorecard will deliver a final usability score (out of 100), allowing for different systems to be compared against the same set of usability criteria. This is especially useful for competitive benchmarking but please bear in mind that a high score doesn’t necessary mean that something is usable, merely that it follows best practice principles (if that makes sense). Heuristics are weighted to ensure that more important points, such as ‘Features and functionality meet common user goals and objectives’ have a greater affect on the overall score than less significant ones. If you’re somewhat old school and prefer pencil and paper to typing comments directly in you can also download a PDF template for doing just this.</p><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"pdf-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Usability-review-template.pdf\" target=\"new\">Usability review template (PDF, 20KB)</a></li></ul><h2>When are usability reviews most useful?</h2><p>Usability reviews are perhaps most useful for a first pass evaluation of a design (all the way from conceptual to high fidelity), and for evaluating a pre-existing design to investigate potential areas for improvement. Also don’t think that it’s a case of either carrying out a usability review or usability testing because like bananas and custard, or gin and tonic, the two are a great combination. A usability review will give you an idea of some of the usability issues that might exist and usability testing will allow you to validate these assumptions and to explore any areas of concern in more detail.</p><p>Usability reviews are also incredibly useful for carrying out competitive benchmarking because they allow you to easily compare the usability of a set of systems against the same criteria. For example, you might work out the usability score for a raft of competitors to see how they compare to your system.</p><h2>Related articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/web-usability/website-review.shtml\">Expert usability review vs. usability testing (Webcredible)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.2791&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">The Evaluator Effect: A Chilling Fact about Usability Evaluation Methods (International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction)</a></li></ul><p><a class=\"a2a_dd a2a_target addtoany_share_save\" href=\"http://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uxforthemasses.com%2Fusability-reviews%2F&amp;title=A%20guide%20to%20carrying%20out%20usability%20reviews\" id=\"wpa2a_18\"><img src=\"/blog/wp-includes/images/share-button.png\" alt=\"Share\"/></a></p>" "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-reviews/" (19797 28137) new 9 nil nil ((title nil "A guide to carrying out usability reviews") (link nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-reviews/") (comments nil "http://www.uxforthemasses.com/usability-reviews/#comments") (pubDate nil "Fri, 11 Feb 2011 17:12:09 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Neil Turner") (category nil "Usability & user research") (category nil "UX tools & techniques") (category nil "Cognitive walkthrough") (category nil "Expert evaluation") (category nil "Heuristic evaluation") (guid ((isPermaLink .

I also discuss when usability reviews are most useful and outline some of the pros and cons of the technique.</p><h2>What are usability reviews?</h2><p>Usability reviews are a structured means of examining the usability of an interactive system by evaluating it against a set of recognised usability best practice principles. Reviews are usually carried out by usability experts, but don’t let that put you off carrying out your own because with a bit of know how and a good set of guidelines anyone can have a go.</p><p>Broadly speaking there are two different types of usability review – scenario based reviews and heuristic based reviews. Scenario based reviews evaluate a system against likely user scenarios, such as buying a product for an ecommerce website. Heuristic reviews on the other hand evaluate an interface against a set of usability heuristics (i.e. best practice), such as links being clear, descriptive and well labelled. The two are by no means mutually exclusive and are often most effective when used together (as you will see).</p><h2>Usability reviews – the good news</h2><p>Usability reviews have a lot going for them as a usability technique, including:</p><ul><li>Usability reviews are <strong>quick and cheap to carry out</strong>. A comprehensive usability review can often be carried in just one or two days.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can be carried out by relative novices</strong> (provided that they have received at least some training in the technique and have a good set of guidelines to follow).</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>can have a 	wide scope</strong>. Whereas usability testing generally evaluates a few specific tasks, usability reviews can quickly cover lots of different functions, usage scenarios and usability areas for a system.</li><li>Usability reviews <strong>are great for competitive benchmarking</strong>. Different systems can be easily compared against the same usability criteria.</li></ul><h2>Usability reviews – the bad news</h2><p>Alas it’s not all good news. Usability reviews also have a number of short comings that you should keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Usability reviews don’t 	actually tell you how usable a system is, </strong>just how usable it should be. The only way to really test the usability of asystem is 	to do just that – test it using usability testing and by examining 	real world usage.</li><li><strong>Important usability issues can be missed</strong> and <strong>suspected usability issues might not be issues at all </strong>as usability reviews are by their nature educated guesses.</li><li><strong>Usability reviews can be inconsistent</strong>.

"<p>What makes a good UX designer? It’s an important question, not just for current and aspiring UX designers, but also for those looking to hire a UX designer and for those working with UX designers. In this article I outline some of the skills, characteristics and qualities that in my opinion a good UX designer should possess and discuss what it is that I think really makes for a good UX designer.</p><h2>But there’s no such thing as a typical UX designer</h2><p>Before I dive in to what in my opinion makes a good UX designer I think that it’s worth pointing out that in my experience there’s really no such thing as a typical UX designer. Although UX related degree and masters courses exist there certainly isn’t a production line somewhere churning out sparkly new UX designers and at the moment there’s very little formal accreditation or certification within the industry (Human Factors International’s <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp\">Certified Usability Analyst</a> and <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CXA.asp\">Certified User Experience Analyst</a> are the only UX related certifications that spring to mind). This is partly because it’s such a new discipline but also because it’s such a varied role and one that invariably requires a wide range of skills and qualities. However, although I don’t think there’s such a thing as a typical UX designer, there are certainly skills, qualities and characteristics that are common across most good UX designers. Here are what I think the most important ones are.</p><h2>Being like Mr T</h2><div id=\"attachment_823\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-823\" title=\"Mr-T\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\" alt=\"Mr T\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I pity the fool! A good UX designer should have a T-shaped skill set</p></div><p>UX designers by nature are a varied bunch. Some come from a technical background; others come from a psychology or graphical design background and others from an industrial design or technical writing background. This means that most UX designers have quite a varied skill set, which is a good thing because to a large extent UX designers should be a jack of several trades, and a master of some. That’s not to say that they should be able to fix a leaking tap, write a best selling novel and run a 4 minute mile, just that UX designers should have excellent design and research skills, along with a good knowledge of related skills, such as graphic design, software development and project management. Such a varied role calls for a varied skill set, one which is typically T-shaped (hence the rather tenuous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T\">Mr T</a> reference). In other words, UX designers should have a good breadth of knowledge, with a good depth of knowledge in a few integral areas, including…</p><h2>Being a designer</h2><p>First and foremost I think that a UX designer should be just that – a designer. This means having a deep knowledge and understanding of user-centred design techniques and principles and being able to design products, be they websites, desktop applications, kiosks or mobile apps that achieve their goals and deliver the intended user experience. It also means having a bag of design tricks up the proverbial sleeve, such as personas, scenarios, storyboards, design sketching and rapid prototyping; and of course knowing when and where to use them.</p><h2>Being a researcher</h2><p>UX designers obviously need to be designers, but they shouldn’t just be designers. They should also be researchers. I don’t necessarily mean the sort of rigorous scientific research that is often undertaken by men in white coats, but design focused research, such as usability testing, ethnography, user interviews, card sorting and analytics. Good designs are founded on good research and feedback, and UX designers should be skilled in gathering this sort of information. Some organisations have traditionally split out UX design and research functions into different teams but I think that this rarely works because the two are so intrinsically connected. One goes hand in hand with the other and to be a really great designer you need to be able to get involved in the research for a design, from the very beginning to hopefully the end.</p><h2>Being a techie</h2><p>Whilst UX design is not primarily a technical discipline I do think that it requires a good understanding of how a design might be built and what some of the technical implications for a design are. After all, it’s no good creating a fantastic design if it can’t be built, or building it would take too long and cost too much in its current form. Equally when discussing a design with engineers and developers you need to know whether, “this can’t be done” really means that something can’t be done, or that it can be done, but in a slightly different way. It also pays to know a thing or two about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility\">Accessibility</a> (sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design\">Universal design</a>) as it can be difficult to make some designs accessible. Technical skills, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and basic coding can also be useful when it comes to creating prototypes, especially as developers are not always on hand to help out.</p><h2>Being a creative</h2><p>UX design is an inherently visual discipline (in so much as people generally take in the largest proportion of their input visually when using a website, software package or other type of interactive system)  and as such the use of colour, layout, imagery, typography and aesthetics in general play an important role in most, if not all designs. I don’t think that UX designers necessarily need to be accomplished graphic designers, but they should at least be aware of graphic design principles such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\">golden ratio</a>, <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/od/alignment/ss/alignment_6.htm\">visual alignment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allgraphicdesign.com/graphicsblog/2008/03/04/the-rules-of-the-gestalt-theory-and-how-to-apply-it-to-your-graphic-design-layouts/\">Gesalt theory</a> and should be able to create designs that don’t look like a dog’s dinner. It’s also worth remembering that it can usually be easier to present and sell designs that are pleasing on the eye (even if they are in their most primitive form) to a sceptical client or customer.</p><h2>Being a suit</h2><p>UX design nearly always takes place within a business context, whether it’s designing a marketable product, carrying out some commissioned work or setting up a new website. I think that it’s therefore important that UX designers are comfortable in the business world and that they possess a good range of business skills. UX designers need to be adept at not only dealing with users, but also colleagues and clients and should be comfortable chairing meetings, running workshops, managing stakeholders and writing business cases etc… It’s also important to remember that behind every design there’s a set of business goals and objectives, such as selling more products, or converting more customers. UX designers need to be able to understand and interpret what the ultimate goal of a design is and be able to communicate this back to the bean counters in the business.</p><h2>Being a team player</h2><p>UX designers are rarely lonesome beasts and can generally be found working very closely with developers, engineers, clients, project managers, fellow designers and all manor of other people. I think that it’s therefore important that they have good team working sills and are comfortable collaborating, mentoring, critiquing, assisting and generally operating within a team environment.</p><div id=\"attachment_824\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-824\" title=\"UX-designer-skillset\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\" alt=\"T-shaped skill set for a UX designer\" width=\"728\" height=\"261\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sort of T-shaped skill set that a good UX designer should possess</p></div><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"pdf-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skill-set.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A good UX designer’s T-shaped skill set (PDF, 36KB)</a></li></ul><h2>It’s more than just skills</h2><p>What makes Lionel Messi the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9356019.stm\">best footballer in the world at the moment</a>?

The same is true of really good UX designers. Good UX designers, don’t just have the right skills, they also have the sort of personal qualities and characteristics that are so important for the role.

Dedication means continually seeking out interesting new design examples and ideas. Its means sharing your own expertise and know how with others. It means learning from other design disciplines, such as architecture, industrial design and software design. It means attending UX design talks, conferences and get togethers in order to learn from other UX designers. Above all it means continually building and refining the skills and characteristics that make a really good UX designer and putting these into practice as much as possible. It’s often said that it takes 10 thousand hours of practice to truly master a discipline (sometimes called the <a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/10000-hour-rule\">10,000 hour rule</a>). Whilst I don’t think that you need to put in this many hours before you can call yourself a good UX designer, there’s no denying that the more hours you put in, the better designer you will be.</p><h2>Related books and articles</h2><p>Some related articles:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/11/the-five-competencies-of-user-experience-design.php\">The Five Competencies of User Experience Design (UX Matters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/12/essential-and-desirable-skills-for-a-ux-designer.php\">Essential and Desirable Skills for a UX Designer (UX Matters)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.uie.com/articles/assessing_ux_teams/\">Assessing Your Team’s UX Skills (User Interface Engineering)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.foolproof.co.uk/grow-your-ux-skill-set/\">Grow your UX skill set (Foolproof blog)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2009/06/30/so-you-wanna-be-a-user-experience-designer-step-1-resources/\">So you wanna be a user experience designer (Whitney Hess)</a></li></ul><p>Books are an excellent way to build your UX designer skill set.

It’s an important question, not just for current and aspiring UX designers, but also for those looking to hire a UX designer and for those working with UX designers. In this article I outline some of the skills, characteristics and qualities that in my opinion a good UX designer should possess and discuss what it is that I think really makes for a good UX designer.</p><h2>But there’s no such thing as a typical UX designer</h2><p>Before I dive in to what in my opinion makes a good UX designer I think that it’s worth pointing out that in my experience there’s really no such thing as a typical UX designer. Although UX related degree and masters courses exist there certainly isn’t a production line somewhere churning out sparkly new UX designers and at the moment there’s very little formal accreditation or certification within the industry (Human Factors International’s <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CUA.asp\">Certified Usability Analyst</a> and <a href=\"http://www.humanfactors.com/certification/CXA.asp\">Certified User Experience Analyst</a> are the only UX related certifications that spring to mind). This is partly because it’s such a new discipline but also because it’s such a varied role and one that invariably requires a wide range of skills and qualities. However, although I don’t think there’s such a thing as a typical UX designer, there are certainly skills, qualities and characteristics that are common across most good UX designers. Here are what I think the most important ones are.</p><h2>Being like Mr T</h2><div id=\"attachment_823\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-823\" title=\"Mr-T\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Mr-T.jpg\" alt=\"Mr T\" width=\"300\" height=\"284\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I pity the fool! A good UX designer should have a T-shaped skill set</p></div><p>UX designers by nature are a varied bunch. Some come from a technical background; others come from a psychology or graphical design background and others from an industrial design or technical writing background. This means that most UX designers have quite a varied skill set, which is a good thing because to a large extent UX designers should be a jack of several trades, and a master of some. That’s not to say that they should be able to fix a leaking tap, write a best selling novel and run a 4 minute mile, just that UX designers should have excellent design and research skills, along with a good knowledge of related skills, such as graphic design, software development and project management. Such a varied role calls for a varied skill set, one which is typically T-shaped (hence the rather tenuous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._T\">Mr T</a> reference). In other words, UX designers should have a good breadth of knowledge, with a good depth of knowledge in a few integral areas, including&#8230;</p><h2>Being a designer</h2><p>First and foremost I think that a UX designer should be just that &#8211; a designer. This means having a deep knowledge and understanding of user-centred design techniques and principles and being able to design products, be they websites, desktop applications, kiosks or mobile apps that achieve their goals and deliver the intended user experience. It also means having a bag of design tricks up the proverbial sleeve, such as personas, scenarios, storyboards, design sketching and rapid prototyping; and of course knowing when and where to use them.</p><h2>Being a researcher</h2><p>UX designers obviously need to be designers, but they shouldn’t just be designers. They should also be researchers. I don’t necessarily mean the sort of rigorous scientific research that is often undertaken by men in white coats, but design focused research, such as usability testing, ethnography, user interviews, card sorting and analytics. Good designs are founded on good research and feedback, and UX designers should be skilled in gathering this sort of information. Some organisations have traditionally split out UX design and research functions into different teams but I think that this rarely works because the two are so intrinsically connected. One goes hand in hand with the other and to be a really great designer you need to be able to get involved in the research for a design, from the very beginning to hopefully the end.</p><h2>Being a techie</h2><p>Whilst UX design is not primarily a technical discipline I do think that it requires a good understanding of how a design might be built and what some of the technical implications for a design are. After all, it’s no good creating a fantastic design if it can’t be built, or building it would take too long and cost too much in its current form. Equally when discussing a design with engineers and developers you need to know whether, “this can’t be done” really means that something can’t be done, or that it can be done, but in a slightly different way. It also pays to know a thing or two about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility\">Accessibility</a> (sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design\">Universal design</a>) as it can be difficult to make some designs accessible. Technical skills, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and basic coding can also be useful when it comes to creating prototypes, especially as developers are not always on hand to help out.</p><h2>Being a creative</h2><p>UX design is an inherently visual discipline (in so much as people generally take in the largest proportion of their input visually when using a website, software package or other type of interactive system)  and as such the use of colour, layout, imagery, typography and aesthetics in general play an important role in most, if not all designs. I don’t think that UX designers necessarily need to be accomplished graphic designers, but they should at least be aware of graphic design principles such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\">golden ratio</a>, <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/od/alignment/ss/alignment_6.htm\">visual alignment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allgraphicdesign.com/graphicsblog/2008/03/04/the-rules-of-the-gestalt-theory-and-how-to-apply-it-to-your-graphic-design-layouts/\">Gesalt theory</a> and should be able to create designs that don’t look like a dog’s dinner. It’s also worth remembering that it can usually be easier to present and sell designs that are pleasing on the eye (even if they are in their most primitive form) to a sceptical client or customer.</p><h2>Being a suit</h2><p>UX design nearly always takes place within a business context, whether it’s designing a marketable product, carrying out some commissioned work or setting up a new website. I think that it’s therefore important that UX designers are comfortable in the business world and that they possess a good range of business skills. UX designers need to be adept at not only dealing with users, but also colleagues and clients and should be comfortable chairing meetings, running workshops, managing stakeholders and writing business cases etc&#8230; It’s also important to remember that behind every design there’s a set of business goals and objectives, such as selling more products, or converting more customers. UX designers need to be able to understand and interpret what the ultimate goal of a design is and be able to communicate this back to the bean counters in the business.</p><h2>Being a team player</h2><p>UX designers are rarely lonesome beasts and can generally be found working very closely with developers, engineers, clients, project managers, fellow designers and all manor of other people. I think that it’s therefore important that they have good team working sills and are comfortable collaborating, mentoring, critiquing, assisting and generally operating within a team environment.</p><div id=\"attachment_824\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-824\" title=\"UX-designer-skillset\" src=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skillset2.png\" alt=\"T-shaped skill set for a UX designer\" width=\"728\" height=\"261\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sort of T-shaped skill set that a good UX designer should possess</p></div><ul class=\"icons\"><li class=\"pdf-icon\"><a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com:/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/UX-designer-skill-set.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A good UX designer&#8217;s T-shaped skill set (PDF, 36KB)</a></li></ul><h2>It’s more than just skills</h2><p>What makes Lionel Messi the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9356019.stm\">best footballer in the world at the moment</a>?
