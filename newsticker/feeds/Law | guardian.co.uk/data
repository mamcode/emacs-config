Forget all that reading and make the most of Wikipedia</p><p>For any law student, time is an invaluable asset. It's not just about working hard; it's about working smart. Here are 10 tips which will save time and sanity for all law students*.</p><h2>1. You don't have to read the whole thing<br /></h2><p>Before reading a case, search for the case summary on Westlaw, or better still, Wikipedia. In exams, you won't expect you to go into a particular judge's reasoning in depth. A simple legal principle is usually enough. If you must read the case, the head-note will refer to specific paragraphs for each legal principle you can quickly skip to.</p><h2>2. Legal research? More like Ctrl + F<br /></h2><p>For legal research, search for keywords in journal articles, get a PDF file of your source materials from Westlaw, LexisNexis, HeinOnline, or JSTOR, and search with Ctrl + F for keywords – done in minutes.</p><h2>3. Using Wikipedia like a boss<br /></h2><p>Wikipedia is your best friend for essays. Just be sure to edit the page after copying and pasting to avoid plagiarism. If you are in need of additional sources, the relevant Wikipedia article should have plenty to \"borrow\". If you have used a proposition from Wikipedia, cite the Wikipedia article's own reference as legal authority.</p><h2>4. Extra content for essays and dissertations <br /></h2><p>Increase the size of all full stops and commas, extend all abbreviations, and make subheadings as big as possible. For dissertations, add a large and well spaced contents page.</p><h2>5. Don't bother printing full case reports <br /></h2><p>You will probably never read them. Every time a law student prints a case a tree dies. Please protect our environment.</p><h2>6. DO NOT READ FACTORTAME <br /></h2><p>Case citation: [2000] 1 TLDR 99 – the Too Long Don't Read law reports. Or indeed any comparably lengthy case. Life is just too short. The chances are that after reading all 130 pages, you'll be none the wiser and frustrated at having wasted hours reading a case you don't understand.</p><h2>7. Blagging your way through a tutorial<br /></h2><p>If you haven't read the case for the tutorial, relate it to another case you do know. Alternatively, say you didn't understand the case and ask the tutor to explain the Court's reasoning at the start of the tutorial.</p><h2>8. Buy your law books second hand<br /></h2><p>Hopefully the previous owner will have highlighted it and added useful annotations so that you don't have to read the entire thing and save a little money.</p><h2>9. All readings are optional <br /></h2><p>The most important thing is that you can understand the law and apply it. Try to do the tutorial/seminar questions first before doing any of the reading. If you managed to get a good grasp of the law from lectures, why waste time learning what you already know?</p><h2>10. Learn to question spot for exams<br /></h2><p>You need not learn the entire syllabus. The first thing to do before starting revision is to look through as many past papers as possible to see which topics are likely to come up. Questions on a single stand-alone topic are a gift. For BPTC students, you might find this year's exam question in a mock exam paper.</p><p></p><p>How many have you tried?

The only other alternative was for the Jordanian prosecutor to prove \"to a high standard that the statements were not procured by torture\".</p><p>The ruling followed a decision by the European court of human rights made final last May that while Qatada did not face a risk of being tortured if returned to Amman he did face the real possibility of a trial based on torture-tainted evidence. The Strasbourg judges said that would amount to a \"flagrant denial of justice\". The home secretary did not appeal against that ruling.</p><p>The law lords – the UK's highest appellate court until the creation of the supreme court – have already considered Qatada's case. In February 2009, six months before the new court was established, they unanimously approved his deportation to Jordan after accepting the country's assurances.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abu-qatada\">Abu Qatada</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/extradition\">Extradition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/criminal-justice\">UK criminal justice</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott\">Owen Bowcott</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In interviews, \"the leaders of the revolt that overthrew Gaddafi expressed surprisingly little bitterness or even anger toward America. (Their attitude towards Britain is a different story.)\"</p><p>The report also concludes that the CIA operated secret prisons within three European countries: Poland and Lithuania, which have acknowledged their existence, and Romania, which continues to deny that such a facility existed.</p><p>The study was embarked upon following the decision by the US president, Barack Obama, on entering the White House in 2009 that there would be no official inquiry into the rendition programme, on the grounds that it would be politically unproductive to \"look backwards\" rather than forwards.</p><p>The Constitution Project enjoyed no access to classified material – unlike the Senate's Intelligence Committee, whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/us/politics/senate-panel-approves-findings-on-prisoner-interrogations.html?_r=1&\" title=\"\">6,000-page report</a> remains secret – but is nevertheless the most detailed attempt yet to produce a public reckoning of the impact of the rendition programme.</p><p>The panel of authors was chaired by Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman who served as an under-secretary at the department of homeland security during the George W Bush administration. Other members include Thomas Pickering, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, a retired lieutenant general from the US army, a former president of the American Bar Association, and a retired army brigadier who taught interrogation techniques.</p><p>In one of their most damning conclusions, the panel says: \"In the course of the nation's many previous conflicts, there is little doubt that some US personnel committed brutal acts against captives, as have armies and governments throughout history. But there is no evidence there had ever before been the kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 11 September, directly involving a president and his top advisers on the wisdom, propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody.\"</p><p>The report calls for the revision of the US army's field manual on interrogation, to prohibit interrogation lasting 40 hours, and to introduce unambiguous bans of the use of stress positions and sleep deprivation.</p><p>In an appendix, the authors dismiss arguments – which have frequently followed party lines in the US – that the mistreatment of detainees after 9/11 fell short of torture, citing cases in which comparable treatment was prosecuted as torture by the US in the past.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rendition\">Rendition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/torture\">Torture</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iancobain\">Ian Cobain</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Jane Nicklinson said she would \"support 100% anyone who is willing to take the case forward. I hope that Tony's contribution can help, and I am happy for anything he has said to be used to further the case. At the very least he has left a legacy.\"</p><p>On 13 March this year, a high court judge agreed to let Lamb take over Nicklinson's appeal. This week the court agreed that Lamb could be named publicly after he told them he was ready to die. \"I cannot carry on as all that my life consists of is being fed and watered,\" he said in a witness statement. He needed help to end his life, he said: \"I am simply not in a position to take tablets, jump off a tall building, hang myself, throw myself in front of a moving train.\"</p><p>His case will be joined to another brought by Jane Nicklinson, appealing against the judgment that condemned her husband to a life he no longer wanted to lead.</p><p>She is able to pursue a claim in her own right under article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European convention. \"She suffered pain, distress and injury as a result of having to witness the cruel, distressing and painful life her husband suffered as he was not able to end his own life,\" said her solicitor, Saimo Chahal.</p><p>The two cases will now be heard in the court of appeal in May.</p><p>Nicklinson's lawyers had argued that the law should be changed so that a doctor who helped him to end his life when he chose could plead a defence of necessity to a charge of murder. But the court said that \"changes involving matters of controversial social policy\" were for parliament, and rejected Nicklinson's claim.</p><p>Lamb, a father of two like Nicklinson, told the Guardian in an interview at his home in Leeds that he wanted the right to end his life at a time and place of his choosing. \"When the end comes, I want it to be in here, in that bed,\" he said, jutting his head towards the bed in his house in the Bramley area of the city. \"I want to end my life in a peaceful, dignified way.\"</p><p>He was going public, he said, after seeing a video of Nicklinson learning that he had lost his appeal, his whole useless body convulsed by sobs. \"It was nothing short of cruel. You do wonder sometimes, the people who make these decisions. They're not the ones in constant pain, unable to do anything for themselves.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's something I believe in passionately. If I can be of any use to change the law, then I'll do it. Eventually the law will change. It has to. It might not be me who changes it. Maybe it will be 10 more people like me down the line. But it will change.\"</p><p>Lamb, a big man with a dry sense of humour, was left with quadriplegia and has no function in any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand after crashing his car into a lamp-post on 21 July 1990. It is unclear what happened, but he may have fallen asleep at the wheel and was probably not wearing a seatbelt.</p><p>Lamb suffers constant and chronic pain in his left shoulder – a pain no medication can dull, though morphine or ketamine make the condition somewhere approaching bearable. He also gets engulfed periodically by waves of depression, but is currently off the anti-depressants. \"I just feel sad about the pointlessness of my life,\" he said.</p><p>His wife divorced him in 2009, but he said his friends and family supported his decision. \"My son [aged 33] said he was so proud of me,\" said Lamb.</p><p>In his witness statement, Lamb explained why he wants the legal right to die.</p><p>\"With my level of disability it is not feasible to avail myself of the right of suicide; a right which I have in theory but not in practice … so the law does discriminate against me by on the one hand giving me a right to end my life, but on the other hand it is not a right I can actually use because of my disabilities. This just does not make sense to me. It seems like a cruel trick on me. I could starve myself, but that does not seem a very dignified way of ending my life and it would be cruel, painful and distressing for my sister and son to witness as well as my carers.</p><p>\"In the last 23 years I have endured a significant amount of pain. I am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have received input from various pain specialists. I have considered having operations. I am constantly on morphine. I suffer from severe pains in the back of my head. I suffer from a pain in my shoulders where the bone has worn away.</p><p>\"I consider that I have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot. Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel that I cannot and do not want to keep living. I feel trapped by the situation and I have no way out.</p><p>\"Over the past 23 years I have given it my best shot in trying to live as fully as I can, but I am now ready to go. People tell me that I must keep trying – but there is only so much that a person can take.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/assisted-suicide\">Assisted dying</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/tony-nicklinson\">Tony Nicklinson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd\">Helen Pidd</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said. Simons said he expected Congress would have to address the imbalance and that the ruling was likely to lead to more not less litigation.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royaldutchshell\">Royal Dutch Shell</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy\">US foreign policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration\">Obama administration</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Dozens of organisation have joined the campaign and tens of thousands of grassroots supporter have signed petitions, blogged, written to MPs and attended rallies. This resulted in manifesto pledges from all three parties, and in turn this led to a defamation bill that has gradually made its way through parliament with cross-party support. However, with victory in sight, free speech advocates were hit by a sucker punch delivered by Sir <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/16/corporations-amendment-commons-libel-debate\" title=\"\">Edward Garnier MP</a>.</p><p>Prior to this week's House of Commons debate, Garnier, who is also a libel lawyer, submitted an 11th-hour amendment, which was adopted by the government and has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/apr/16/conservatives-block-key-libel-reform\" title=\"\">stripped the bill of two of its important elements</a>. First, there was the widely supported measure to stop companies that deliver public services from bullying and gagging their critics. Second, there was a growing consensus that there should be restrictions on the ability of companies to sue for libel by making them demonstrate actual or likely financial harm before trying to silence criticism. Both these proposals, which are very moderate steps, have now been abandoned.</p><p>Many of the worst cases that triggered the campaign for libel reform involved corporations suing critics, so these particular sections of the bill are vital to reduce future abuses of libel law. Indeed, I was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/22/simon-singh-british-chiropractic-association\" title=\"\">sued</a> by the British Chiropractic Association after writing an article in the Guardian in 2008. The case cost both sides about £500,000. Although I won the case, the damage done to me and my family was enormous. However, had the BCA been forced to show that my article had caused it serious financial harm, then the action would have been thrown out immediately. This would have saved both me and the BCA a great deal of time, money and stress.</p><p>By removing any restrictions on the use of libel laws by corporations, the government is ignoring the advice of the joint scrutiny committee on the draft defamation bill, chaired by Lord Mawhinney, which stated: \"It is unacceptable that corporations are able to silence critical reporting by threatening or starting libel claims which they know the publisher cannot afford to defend and where there is no realistic prospect of serious financial loss.\"</p><p>Similarly, in 2010, the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee recommended that it should be necessary for \"a corporation to prove actual damage to its business before an action could be brought\".</p><p>However, all is not lost. Liberal MPs such as <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/julian-huppert-writes-update-on-the-defamation-bill-34138.html\" title=\"\">Julian Huppert</a> and Conservative MP Peter Bottomley have pointed out in the strongest terms how libel law has been abused in the past and how this will continue in the future unless the issue of corporations is dealt with in the defamation bill. This reinforces the view of the Labour shadow justice team, who have repeatedly backed the Libel Reform Campaign on the issue of corporations.</p><p>In response, Helen Grant, the minister for courts and victims, said the government would \"actively consider\" amendments to the bill that would require corporations to show financial loss before they can sue for libel. This is vague, but it does leave open the possibility that these elements can be re-introduced into the bill when it heads to the House of Lords next week. The government now has a final opportunity to do the right thing.</p><p>When I attended a forum on libel reform at the British Academy in 2011, 20 figures ranging from law professors to leading libel law firm, Carter Ruck, from MPs to free speech groups, discussed the issue of corporations. There was unanimous agreement that there needed to be restrictions on the right of corporations to sue in libel.</p><p>Even corporations are not arguing against this moderate restriction to their ability to silence critics. The only person who seems to be particularly keen to encourage companies to sue bloggers, scientists, Mumsnet, Which? and human rights groups is Sir Edward Garnier and libel barristers. I hope that the government will ignore him.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/libel-reform\">Libel reform</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/defamation-law\">Defamation law</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/medialaw\">Media law</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simon-singh\">Simon Singh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/14/companies-missing-boardroom-targets-women\" title=\"\">Davies Report </a>has produced a flurry of appointments for women into non-executive roles, but the pipeline for senior executive appointments remains overwhelmingly male.</p><p></p><p>Yet women are out performing men at university and, in many sectors, at the graduate recruitment stage. So what happens when it comes to the stage in a woman's career where appointments are being made to the senior posts which pay the big money and carry all the status?</p><p>Conventional wisdom has it that women are distracted by the burden of childcare and make work–life balance decisions that favour family over career. It is undoubtedly true that long office hours and lack of flexible working options do play a part, but is this the whole story? Many commentators consider that unconscious bias has just as much of a role to play in keeping the glass ceiling remains stubbornly in place, and a recent discrimination case in the employment tribunal has provided a good illustration of this.</p><p>The case concerned a claim of race rather than sex discrimination, but the principles emerging from it are absolutely relevant to the gender debate. A woman of African-Caribbean origin, Ms Francis, was passed over for promotion in favour of a white, also female, candidate. She was not able to show any evidence at all of overt racial bias. There was no history of racial slurs or poor treatment related to race. Her claim, however, succeeded. Why?</p><p>The way that the law operates is that once a claimant has shown a difference in treatment (ie not being promoted in this case) and a difference in race, the burden passes to the employer to explain why the different treatment was not related to race. If there had been clear evidence that the white candidate had scored much better in the selection process, the case would have failed. However, the evidence before the tribunal showed that the all-white panel had taken an inconsistent approach to scoring.</p><p>Also, significantly, the tribunal accepted that there was a de facto glass ceiling in place which prevented non-white employees from achieving more senior roles. Three black employees gave evidence that informal sponsorship and encouragement was given to white staff, but not to black staff. The tribunal's conclusion was that the employer had failed to show that its decision to promote the white candidate was not influenced by race.</p><p>It's clear from this case that leaving these issues to be resolved by the passage of time, or relying on the old chestnut that your business is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/jun/17/comment.mainsection2\" title=\"\">meritocracy</a>, could actually be creating a risk of discrimination claims. The whole point about unconscious bias is that it's unconscious, and all the equal opportunities policies in the world are not going to address that.</p><p>Discrimination these days isn't about anything as crude as racial or gender-based insults, as the Francis case demonstrates (although that's not to say that they've vanished altogether). It's about people making decisions which are unconsciously influenced by affinity bias, ie a tendency to favour \"people like us\". If the people making decisions about promotion are mostly male and mostly white, the likelihood is that they will be sponsoring, encouraging and promoting people in their own image without even realising that this is what they are doing.</p><p>Many employers are now choosing to take positive action, using transparent promotion processes, unconscious bias training and targets for parity in senior roles to tackle the problem, rather than relying on a meritocratic culture to break down the glass ceiling on its own. Either way, the issue needs to be confronted head-on if an employer is to have any chance of persuading a tribunal (and its own staff) that its culture and processes are not tainted by bias.</p><p>Unconscious bias is something that affects everyone, and no one pretends that it's easily eradicated. But realising that it does exist and that it is potentially creating business risk is a good starting point.</p><p><em>Linda Jones is an employment partner at international law firm, </em><a href=\"http://www.pinsentmasons.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Pinsent Masons</em></a></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/\">Sign up to become a member</a> of the Women in Leadership community for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to your inbox</strong></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/hr\">HR</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/pay\">Pay</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/policy\">Policy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/mentoring-and-sponsorship\">Mentoring and sponsorship</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/management\">Management</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality\">Equality</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/employment-law\">Employment law</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/employment-tribunals\">Employment tribunals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/women-in-leadership/legal\">Legal</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kate-mccann\">Kate McCann</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

After two days in Georgia we drove east, the hilly landscape gradually turning mountainous, sheep and cattle tended by shepherds in littered, post-Soviet villages. For a long time the road followed a small river, plastic trash snagging on rocks and branches. This could have been a landscape of extraordinary beauty; instead it was depleted and scarred by nearly a century of bad or indifferent governance.</p><p>Crossing the border into Armenia, the river was still there, the litter now older, almost indistinguishable from the brown water and grey rock. There were remnants of the Soviet state – giant concrete chutes channelling water from the steep mountains, occasional blocks of flats now, like the rubbish, taking on the colour of the dark earth. In one valley ruins from the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/10/newsid_2544000/2544077.stm\" title=\"\">earthquake in 1988</a> stood like archaeological remains.</p><p>Every village we drove through was half abandoned – the falling down houses haphazardly mended with metal sheets or planks of wood. Whole families move if they can, otherwise women and children remain while the men join the migrant labour force in Russia, sending meagre remittances home. I know there were children in these villages, because occasionally laundry – the only colour in this bleak world – hung from wires, drying in the still dusk. We saw no people, and no shops. We saw no other cars.</p><p>In Britain we sometimes forget the harsh reality behind the talk of human rights in transitional states. Human rights language is the same the world over, bland and institutional. Thus in Georgia many groups talked about \"prison reform\". The issue in fact was the widespread use of torture, revealed when secret footage was released of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/19/georgia-prison-guards-torture-video\" title=\"\">detainees raped with broom handles</a> or burned with cigarettes, guards looking on, indifferent to the screams. The victims were ordinary criminals; this was part of police and prison routine. After the release of the footage, thousands of people took to the streets, the minister for corrections had to resign; 16 out of 17 prison directors were fired. Some claim the footage was staged; no one, however, disputes that those things went on.</p><p>Other groups talked about \"corruption\" and \"transparency\". Here is one case: an Armenian shopkeeper is visited by tax officials, demanding a bribe. He refuses, and takes them to court. Several years and many court cases later he wins his case, but by now the same tax officials have so terrorised his suppliers that he can't stay in business.</p><p>In Armenia campaigners talked about \"hospital reform\". Many people with learning disabilities rather than mental illness are institutionalised in mental hospitals. Even if you are let out, once in the system you can be committed at any time in the future by a doctor's order.</p><p>The human rights activists (some former dissidents) we met steadfastly rely on, and believe in, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, despite the fact that tens of thousands of cases are languishing there in a seemingly permanent backlog. It's all they have.</p><p>European solidarity is an empty concept to most British people, at least judging from the media. But democracy and the rule of law on the margins of Europe matter to all of us. Georgia and Armenia, and 14 other nations, are in talks with the EU under the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/policy_en.htm\" title=\"\">European neighbourhood policy</a>. It offers a degree of economic integration in return for a commitment to democracy and human rights, the rule of law, market economy principles and sustainable development. Free trade for good governance – it's a win-win deal.</p><p>In Georgia and Armenia, however, so long after the fall of the Soviet Union, the state is still weak – and occasionally thuggish – the economies are largely oligarchical, and there is a lack of watchdog institutes – that function is almost entirely given over to civil society. As in all former Soviet republics, there is a history of institutional brutality and indifference lingering on in the army, the prisons, hospitals and orphanages.</p><p>And yet people in Yerevan, the capital, talked hopefully of an Armenian spring. Serge Sarkisian, the president (and Putin ally), <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21495377\" title=\"\">won a second term</a> in the recent election, but not with anything like the Soviet-style 90% majority pollsters had suggested. Significant numbers of ballot papers had been spoiled. (The fact that <a href=\"http://www.armradio.am/en/2013/02/01/paruyr-hayrikian-shot-taken-to-hospital/\" title=\"\">one candidate, a former dissident, was shot and wounded</a> in January may have contributed to voter disaffection.) The main opposition candidate, the American-born Raffi Hovannisian (37% of the vote), held a <a href=\"http://www.armenianweekly.com/2013/04/09/hovannisian-holds-alternative-inauguration-as-sarkisian-takes-oath-of-office/\" title=\"\">shadow swearing-in ceremony</a> on 9 April.</p><p>In this region, as in any other, individuals come and go, and sometimes, as we have seen in Georgia, good people turn bad. European integration is the best bet for good governance. The alternative for Armenia is Russia, where NGOs receiving foreign funding are now required to register as \"foreign agents\". European trade agreements and human rights requirements must be better than that, for them and for us.</p><p><em>Sigrid Rausing travelled to Georgia and Armenia with the Open Society Institute</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/georgia\">Georgia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/armenia\">Armenia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/european-court-of-human-rights\">European court of human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/torture\">Torture</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sigrid-rausing\">Sigrid Rausing</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He told the local press that the government would identify all those schools that fail to meet standards and close them to stop the exploitation of children.</p><p></p><p>In the coming months, the Senegalese government is expected to unveil an ambitious plan that will regulate the Qur'anic schools, known as <em>daaras</em>, and put an end to children begging on the streets by the end of next year.</p><p></p><p>\"The plan hopes to rejuvenate a law drafted in 2007 that regulates the daaras<em> </em>by introducing operating norms and standards, as well as evaluating and identifying daaras<em> </em>that need to be shut down,\" said Amsatou Sow Sidibe, a presidential adviser.</p><p></p><p>Two other laws on child begging and child trafficking have rarely been enforced because of contradictions in the legal system and pressure from religious quarters that still wield considerable political and economical influence within the country.</p><p></p><p>\"[Child] traffickers take refuge behind article 245 of the penal code, which contradicts the 2005 law and states that soliciting alms as part of religious traditions is not an act of begging. What's more, there is intense lobbying and pressure from some Qur'anic masters whenever the government takes drastic measures against child trafficking,\" said Sidibe.</p><p></p><p>Parents sending their children away with marabouts in an informal system known as <em>confiage</em> is not a new phenomenon in Senegal. The parents see this as an opportunity for the child to learn about Islam but poverty often plays an important role in this decision. The victims of the fire were aged between seven and 12, and came from the Kolda region, one of the poorest areas of Senegal.</p><p></p><p>\"Senegal allocates just 0.8% of its budget to the ministry of family, which is responsible for social safety nets,\" said Jean Lieby, head of child protection for Unicef Senegal. \"Unicef is piloting a 'cash transfer' programme that aims to give impoverished parents grants so they can feed, clothe and protect their children from abuse, exploitation and trafficking.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel search and rescue type operation, which is also funded by Unicef, in urban centres including Dakar and Kolda identifies vulnerable children and reintegrates them with their families, many of whom have no idea of their child's suffering.</p><p></p><p>Mariama Diao, who sent her son, Mamadou, away with a travelling marabout from Guinea-Bissau, only found out how her son was suffering when a talibé<em> </em>from the same daara<em> </em>in Dakar told her that Mamadou had run away.</p><p></p><p>\"We sent Mamadou away with the marabout<em> </em>to learn about Islam, but we didn't hear from him in four years,\" said Diao, from Guiré Yéro, a small village near the border with Guinea-Bissau. \"The last time the marabout<em> </em>came back to the village, he told us Mamadou was doing fine, that he was not just begging, but also learning the Qur'an, even though he didn't know where Mamadou was,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Marabouts who mistreat children in this way should be punished with the full force of the law,\" Diao added.</p><p></p><p>Mamadou was eventually found and returned to his family by La Lumière, a local NGO that reintegrates children into their communities. According to the NGO, some parents had been told by marabouts<em> </em>that their children were dead when they were not.</p><p></p><p>The mistreatment of children has prompted some religious leaders to speak up against child begging. Just weeks before the fire, a highly respected relgious leader had told parents to stop sending their children away with marabouts in an article in the daily Le Quotidien that was seen as the first time such a high-ranking <em>Khalife </em>had<em> </em>spoken out publicly on the issue of talibés.</p><p></p><p>\"Stop sending your children to study outside of your locality. There, they are good for begging, hard work and beatings,\" said Khalife Thierno Amadou Baldé, the 70-year-old spiritual leader of the Peuhl people.

I'm an optimist in this case. Lord Justice Leveson in his report made it clear it is important in the process we follow that we take both the public and press with us.</p><p></p><p>\"We've made a great deal of progress with the proposals and we are now pursuing working with the press with, I think, quite legitimate issues they raised.\"</p><p></p><p>Miller and Letwin were repeatedly questioned about the viability of the government's plans, with Conservative MP Philip Davies accusing them of being \"in denial\" about the prospects of getting the newspaper industry on board.</p><p></p><p>Miller replied: \"We haven't yet set this up, it is a little premature to say not signed up. It is important not to develop an approach in blessed isolation of the people who are actually going to be setting up the self regulation itself.</p><p></p><p>\"I believe what we set out is a fair approach and something which given conversations we've had is something industry will want to carefully consider.\"</p><p></p><p>Letwin spent considerable time attempting to debunk what he viewed as a \"glorious mythology\" that has built up around the role that campaigning group Hacked Off played in the late-night talks between the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems that resulted in the political deal last month that allowed the press reform legislation to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Letwin claimed that the press reform pressure group's involvement in the cross party talks in the late night and early morning of the Sunday 17 and Monday 18 March came after the main elements had already been hammered out.</p><p></p><p>\"The things that we put forward at an earlier hour were broadly accepted,\" he said. \"There was no major negotiation that went on, I'm sorry to say, to disabuse you of this glorious mythology, in the course of the early hours [of Monday morning].</p><p></p><p>\"What did happen was we documented a heads of terms that reflected what we had put forward at 3pm and 6pm [on Sunday, before Hacked Off became involved].

But what about blasting Radio 4? Or building obnoxious extensions?</p><p>Robert Thomas, who plagued his neighbours by playing <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9994723/BBC-World-Service-fan-plagued-neighbours-by-playing-Radio-4-non-stop.html\" title=\"\">Radio 4 at full volume</a> at all hours has appeared in court charged with breaking his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/asbo\" title=\"\">asbo</a>. While this case escalated rapidly – Thomas ended up with vandalism charges and sprayed his neighbours with a garden hose – his Radio 4 obsession initially struck me as a rather genteel form of noise pollution. When I think of noisy neighbours, I think of those who pump out happy hardcore at 3pm, not the ones avidly listening to the The Archers omnibus.</p><p>How many other stories concerning antisocial behaviour don't we hear about in the media? While you will often read gleeful stories in the tabloids about terrible neighbours who fight all day long or leave rubbish strewn around, you'll rarely hear much of the apparently mild-mannered man up the road who aggressively blocks your parking space every day just to get a rise out of you. I'd bet that most middle-class people would deny behaving badly in any social situation, imagining their conduct to always be absolutely appropriate. Yet I can think of many examples of situations in which the more fortunate in society enrage, irritate and provoke. Below are just a few of my candidates for middle-class asbos:</p><p>• The darling son of your next-door neighbour who is learning to play the violin. \"Yes, little Gabriel has just started and already has such a gift! And he's so committed, he plays for at least an hour a day. Sometimes when he's feeling really inspired, he wanders around the garden, lost in the music he's creating!\" Gabriel is a moron who makes a noise like scraping nails on a blackboard. On this occasion, playing happy hardcore is positively encouraged. Or you could do what <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/giles-corens-twitter-tirade-at-neighbours-boy-for-playing-drum-kit-6720441.html\" title=\"\">Giles Coren did</a>, and get in rather more trouble.</p><p>• People who buy those buggies that seem more hi-tech than your car, and take up more space. Try to overtake someone with one of those buggies, I dare you. The driver will miraculously weave across the pavement and cut you up, usually while looking harassed because they can't control the damn thing. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/yummy-mummies-rude-demanding-cafes\" title=\"\">And if you see one in a small cafe</a>, give up your principles and just go to Starbucks. Big corporation, wide aisles.</p><p>• People without real allergies who order off-menu. Of course some people have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease\" title=\"\">coeliac disease</a>, and some people can't eat nuts. But there seem to be a suspicious amount of them in trendy establishments. \"I'd really love the risotto, but is it possible to order it without the tomatoes/parsley/oil? I'm just really intolerant.\" They are making the waiter's life harder, and assuming the chef has time to create a whole new dish. Be intolerant of these people instead.</p><p>• People who build <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/15/planning-reforms-floodgates-unsuitable-extensions\" title=\"\">massive, obnoxious extensions</a>. Since Grand Designs, everyone with a urge to have their own glass-roof yoga room seems to think it's acceptable to tear half their house down and then invite the builders to stay for what seems like an eternity. You end up facing a monstrosity of steel and mirrors, and the foundations of your flat will most likely crumble to dust in the next five years. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/jul/25/broadcasting.tvandradio1\" title=\"\">Thanks Kevin McCloud! </a></p><p>• The businessman who cannot put his Blackberry or iPhone down. He is so important, so desperately needed, that he'll order a coffee while not looking up from firing off a missive to some unpaid intern. He'll sit next to you on the train tapping away frantically for six hours, while simultaneously shouting importantly into his phone about quarterly figures. He is more successful than you; suck it up, underlings.</p><p>Those are some of my worst, but what have I missed? Can you help me build a comprehensive list of middle-class asbos?

There are, however, several points to be made about some of the widespread reactions to this incident. Much of that reaction is all-too-familiar and quite revealing in important ways:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> The widespread compassion for yesterday's victims and the intense anger over the attacks was obviously authentic and thus good to witness. But it was really hard not to find oneself wishing that just a fraction of that compassion and anger be devoted to attacks that the US perpetrates rather than suffers. These are exactly the kinds of horrific, civilian-slaughtering attacks that the US has been <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/7806882/US-cluster-bombs-killed-35-women-and-children.html\">bringing to countries in the Muslim world</a> over and over and over again <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/newtown-drones-children-deaths\">for the last decade</a>, with very little attention paid. My Guardian colleague Gary Younge put this best on Twitter this morning:</p><p>Juan Cole this morning <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2013/04/bombings-increase-sympathy.html?\">makes a similar point</a> about violence elsewhere. Indeed, just yesterday in Iraq, at least 42 people were killed and more than 250 injured by <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/15/world/meast/iraq-violence\">a series of car bombs</a>, the enduring result of the US invasion and destruction of that country. Somehow the deep compassion and anger felt in the US when it is attacked never translates to understanding the effects of our own aggression against others.</p><p>One particularly illustrative example I happened to see yesterday was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/freddoso/status/323896859426967553\">a re-tweet from Washington Examiner columnist David Freddoso</a>, proclaiming: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Idea of secondary bombs designed to kill the first responders is just sick. How does anyone become that evil?\" </p></blockquote><p><br />I don't disagree with that sentiment. But I'd bet a good amount of money that the person saying it - and the vast majority of other Americans - have no clue that targeting rescuers with \"double-tap\" attacks is <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/\">precisely what the US now does</a> with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">its drone program</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\">other forms of militarism</a>. If most Americans knew their government and military were doing this, would they react the same way as they did to yesterday's Boston attack: \"Idea of secondary bombs designed to kill the first responders is just sick. How does anyone become that evil?\" That's highly doubtful, and that's the point.</p><p>There's nothing wrong per se with paying more attention to tragedy and violence that happens relatively nearby and in familiar places. Whether wrong or not, it's probably human nature, or at least human instinct, to do that, and that happens all over the world. I'm not criticizing that. But one wishes that the empathy for victims and outrage over the ending of innocent human life that instantly arises when the US is targeted by this sort of violence would at least translate into similar concern when the US is perpetrating it, as it so often does (far, far more often than it is targeted by such violence).</p><p>Regardless of your views of justification and intent: whatever rage you're feeling toward the perpetrator of this Boston attack, that's the rage in sustained form that people across the world feel toward the US for killing innocent people in their countries. Whatever sadness you feel for yesterday's victims, the same level of sadness is warranted for the innocent people whose lives are ended by American bombs. However profound a loss you recognize the parents and family members of these victims to have suffered, that's the same loss experienced by victims of US violence. It's natural that it won't be felt as intensely when the victims are far away and mostly invisible, but applying these reactions to those acts of US aggression would go a long way toward better understanding what they are and the outcomes they generate.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> The rush, one might say the eagerness, to conclude that the attackers were Muslim was palpable and unseemly, even without any real evidence. The New York Post <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/authorities_under_suspect_guard_y2m8cJO29uC2PDGIjYBalO\">quickly claimed</a> that the prime suspect was a Saudi national (while also inaccurately reporting that 12 people had been confirmed dead). The Post's insinuation of responsibility was also <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1304/15/pmt.01.html\">suggested on CNN</a> by Former Bush Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend (\"We know that there is one Saudi national who was wounded in the leg who is being spoken to\"). Former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/jane-harman-calls-boston-marathon-bombings-an-al-qaeda-like-attack\">went on CNN</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=harman%20cnn&src=typd\">grossly speculate</a> that Muslim groups were behind the attack. Anti-Muslim bigots like Pam Geller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Atlasshrugs/status/323918722282704897\">predictably announced</a> that this was \"Jihad in America\". Expressions of hatred for Muslims, and a desire to do violence, were then <a href=\"http://publicshaming.tumblr.com/post/48093470152/two-explosives-went-off-at-the-boston-marathon-on\">spewing forth all over Twitter</a> (some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliespiering/status/323929668409516032\">particularly unscrupulous partisan Democrat types</a> were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ckilpatrick/status/323893466956455936\">identically suggesting with zero evidence</a> that the attackers were right-wing extremists).</p><p>Obviously, it's possible that the perpetrator(s) will turn out to be Muslim, just like it's possible they will turn out to be extremist right-wing activists, or left-wing agitators, or Muslim-fearing Anders-Breivik types, or lone individuals driven by apolitical mental illness. But the rush to proclaim the guilty party to be Muslim is seen in particular over and over with such events. Recall that on the day of the 2011 Oslo massacre by a right-wing, Muslim-hating extremist, the New York Times spent virtually <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/23/nyt_17/\">the entire day strongly suggesting in its headlines</a> that an Islamic extremist group was responsible, a claim <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/benjamin-doherty/how-clueless-terrorism-expert-set-media-suspicion-muslims-after-oslo-horror\">other major news outlets</a> (including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ravisomaiya/status/94484706573299712\">the BBC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/07/the-washington-post-owes-the-world-an-apology-for-this-item/242400/\">Washington Post</a>) then repeated as fact. The same thing happened with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, when <a href=\"http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-oklahoma-city-bombing/\">most major US media outlets strongly suggested</a> that the perpetrators were Muslims. As FAIR documented back then:</p><blockquote><p><br />\"In the wake of the explosion that destroyed the Murrah Federal Office Building, <em>the media rushed — almost en masse — to the assumption that the bombing was the work of Muslim extremists</em>. 'The betting here is on Middle East terrorists,' declared CBS News' Jim Stewart just hours after the blast (4/19/95). 'The fact that it was such a powerful bomb in Oklahoma City immediately drew investigators to consider deadly parallels that all have roots in the Middle East,' ABC's John McWethy proclaimed the same day.</p><p>\"'It has every single earmark of the Islamic car-bombers of the Middle East,' wrote syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer (Chicago Tribune, 4/21/95). 'Whatever we are doing to destroy Mideast terrorism, the chief terrorist threat against Americans, has not been working,' declared the New York Times' A.M. Rosenthal (4/21/95). The Geyer and Rosenthal columns were filed after the FBI released sketches of two suspects who looked more like Midwestern frat boys than mujahideen.\"</p></blockquote><p>This lesson is never learned because, it seems, many people don't want to learn it. Even when it turns out not to have been Muslims who perpetrated the attack but rather right-wing, white Christians, the damage from this relentless and reflexive blame-pinning endures.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> One <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/15/please-dont-be-a-muslim-boston-marathon-blasts-draw-condemnation-and-dread-in-muslim-world/\">continually encountered yesterday expressions of dread and fear</a> from Arabs and Muslims around the world that the attacker would be either or both. That's because they know that all members of their religious or ethnic group will be blamed, or worse, if that turns out to be the case. That's true even though leading Muslim-American groups such as CAIR <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAIRNational/status/323946416760291329\">harshly condemned the attack</a> (as <a href=\"http://ct.cair.com/about-us/cair-s-anti-terrorism-campaigns.html\">they always do</a>) and urged support for the victims, including blood donations. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LibyaLiberty/status/324122822106574850\">One tweeter</a>, referencing the earthquake that hit Iran this morning, satirized this collective mindset by writing: \"Please don't be a Muslim plate tectonic activity.\"</p><p>As understandable as it is, that's just sad to witness. No other group reacts with that level of fear to these kinds of incidents, because no other group has similar cause to fear that they will all be hated or targeted for the acts of isolated, unrepresentative individuals. A similar dynamic has long prevailed in the domestic crime context: when the perpetrators of notorious crimes turned out to be African-American, the entire community usually paid a collective price. But the unique and well-grounded dread that hundreds of millions of law-abiding, peaceful Muslims and Arabs around the world have about the prospect that this attack in Boston was perpetrated by a Muslim highlights the climate of fear that has been created for and imposed on them over the last decade.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> The reaction to the Boston attack underscored, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/02/19/terrorism_19/\">yet again</a>, the utter meaninglessness of the word \"terrorism\". News outlets were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pareene/status/323923580561801216/photo/1\">seemingly scandalized</a> that President Obama, in his initial remarks, did not use the words \"terrorist attack\" to describe the bombing. In response, the White House ran to the media to assure them that they considered it \"terrorism\". Fox News' Ed Henry <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edhenryTV/status/323932072278368259\">quoted</a> a \"senior administration official\" as saying this: \"When multiple (explosive) devices go off that's an act of terrorism.\"</p><p>Is that what \"terrorism\" is? \"When multiple (explosive) devices go off\"? If so, that encompasses a great many things, including what the US does in the world on a very regular basis. Of course, the quest to know whether this was \"terrorism\" is really code for: \"was this done by Muslims\"? That's because, in US political discourse, \"terrorism\" <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/11/09/terrorism_7/\">has no real meaning other than</a>: violence perpetrated by Muslims against the west. The reason there was such confusion and uncertainty about whether this was \"terrorism\" is because there is no clear and consistently applied definition of the term. At this point, it's <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/03/14/terrorism_20/\">little more than a term of emotionally manipulative propaganda</a>. That's been proven over and over, and it was again yesterday.</p><p><strong>(5)</strong> The history of these types of attacks over the last decade has been clear and consistent: they are exploited to obtain new government powers, increase state surveillance, and take away individual liberties. On NBC with Brian Williams last night, Tom Brokaw <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nbc-news/51552278/#51552278\">decreed that this will happen again and instructed us that we must meekly submit it to it</a>:</p><blockquote><p><br />\"Everyone has to understand tonight that, beginning tomorrow morning early, there are going to be much tougher security considerations all across the country, and however exhausted we may be by that, we're going to have to learn to live with them, and get along and go forward, and not let them bring us to our knees. You'll remember last summer, how unhappy we were with the security at the Democratic and Republic conventions. Now I don't think we can raise those complaints after what happened in Boston.\"</p></blockquote><p>Last night on Chris Hayes' MSNBC show, an FBI agent discussed the fact that the US government has the right to arrest terrorism suspects and not provide them with Miranda warnings before questioning them. After seeing numerous people express surprise at this claim on Twitter, I pointed out that this happened when the Obama administration exploited the attempted underwear bombing over Detroit <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/03/24/obama_rolls_back_miranda/\">to radically reduce Miranda rights</a> over what they had been for decades. That's what the US government (aided by the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/15/the_sham_terrorism_expert_industry/\">sham \"terrorism expert\" industry</a>) does in every single one of these cases: exploits the resulting fear to increase its own power and decrease everyone else's rights, including privacy.</p><p>At the Atlantic, security expert Bruce Schneier has a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/the-boston-marathon-bombing-keep-calm-and-carry-on/275014/\">short but compelling article</a> on how urgent it is that we not react to this Boston attack irrationally or with exaggerated fear, and that we particularly remain vigilant against government attempts to exploit fear to impose all new rights-reducing measures. He notes in particular how the more unusual an event is (such as this sort of attack on US soil), the more our brains naturally exaggerate its significance and frequency (John Cole makes <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2013/04/15/something-else-to-talk-about/\">a similar point</a>).</p><p>In sum, even if the perpetrators of Monday's attack in Boston turn out to be politically motivated and subscribers to an anti-US ideology, it will still be a very rare event, one that poses far less danger to Americans than literally countless other threats. The most important lesson of the excesses arising from the 9/11 attacks should be this one: that the dangers of overreacting and succumbing to irrational fear are far, far greater than any other dangers posed by these type of events.</p><h2>Update [Wed.]</h2><p>In the New Yorker, Amy Davidson has <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/04/the-saudi-marathon-man.html\">a superb and chilling analysis</a> of how a 20-year-old Saudi <em>victim</em> of the bombing was instantly, and baselessly, converted by the US media and government into a \"suspect\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/glenn-greenwald\">Glenn Greenwald</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As this important documentary exposes, so far the tactic has been prosecuting or harassing national security whistleblowers. And there's danger the <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/28/Obama-Trashes-Whistle-Blower-Protection-For-Federal-Employees\">full-scale crackdown could expand to canceling the independent job rights</a> of nearly all government workers in the name of national security. Ironically, the threats are from an administration that championed <a href=\"http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2012/11/15/new-whistleblower-law-will-significantly-strengthen-federal-employee-protections/\">historic whistleblower protection laws</a>.</p><p>This contradictory circumstance has produced the best and worst of times.</p><p>The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) provides unprecedented employment protections. No other president has come close to President Obama on strengthening whistleblower job rights. Thanks to him, even national security workers now have in-house free speech rights. These breakthroughs last year were enormous wins after decades of resistance. </p><p>Simultaneously, the Obama administration has attacked more national security whistleblowers as Espionage Act criminals than all previous administrations combined, lumping them in with spies. The WPEA provides on-the-job protections, but does nothing against retaliatory prosecutions.</p><p>While they are the fewest in numbers, we need national security whistleblowers the most. They expose the worst abuses of power: blanket illegal wiretapping, human rights abuses, military murder of journalists and war crimes.</p><p>They keep us safer, too. Senior Marines science adviser <a href=\"http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/government-employees/federal-employees/troop-safetyfranz-gayl\">Franz Gayl blew the whistle</a> and freed delivery of life-saving MRAPs (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles) to Iraq, overcoming delays responsible for thousands of unnecessary casualties. Then came nightmarish years climaxed by loss of security clearance to finish him off. He was eventually reinstated in a still-pending legal case.</p><p>Whistleblowers like Gayl first tried institutional channels and did not leak any classified information, yet were treated as potential traitors. That sends a strong message: if you see something wrong, keep quiet. Tailing cars and families, surveillance of homes and communication, criminal investigations, and FBI gunpoint raids increasingly are the tactics to silence national security whistleblowers.</p><p>Far from accidental or random, this reflects the calculated, sustained campaign by a rapidly expanding national security bureaucracy that is winning a war within the administration.</p><p>Sometimes whistleblowers must rely on reporters to get the truth out. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/04/26/135735752/report-justice-drops-probe-of-leaker-who-exposed-bush-era-wiretapping\">Thomas Tamm revealed Bush-era warrantless wiretapping</a> in the New York Times. WikiLeaks and the Pentagon Papers were exposed through news stories. Without national security whistleblowers, the media can't do its job when the stakes are highest: threats to freedom from our own government.</p><p>Award-winning reporters like Michael Isikoff, Seymour Hersh, Jane Mayer, Bill Keller, Tom Vanden Brook, Dana Priest and David Carr criticize the repression in War on Whistleblowers. These top-caliber journalists highlight whistleblower media partnerships and sound the alarm about a crackdown.</p><p>None too soon. The stakes have just been raised exponentially. In court and proposed rules, the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-27/obama-memo-on-sensitive-jobs-stirs-whistle-blower-fears.html\">administration is seeking to rebrand virtually all federal employees</a> as national security workers at the mercy of a McCarthy-era executive order, outside the civil service rule of law that has kept the federal workforce professional and non-partisan since 1883.</p><p>They no longer could defend themselves against charged misconduct at the independent <a href=\"http://www.mspb.gov/\">Merit Systems Protection Board</a>. The WPEA's provisions, laws against race, sex and religious discrimination and the ban on political purges, all would lose relevancy. They'd be replaced by self-policing from agencies empowered to designate virtually any employee a \"sensitive\" national security worker. This means a civil service system vulnerable to replacement by a national security spoils system. The administration's litigation and regulatory blitz seeks to turn all job and transparency rights into window-dressing.</p><p>Reinforcing the forces of light in this bizarre Obama v Obama war, his own appointees from the Office of Special Counsel and MSPB are in court fighting the Justice Department over the national security exception. <a href=\"http://www.makeitsafecampaign.org/?p=1360#more-1360\">The GAP's Make It Safe Campaign is petitioning</a> President Obama to demand that he let his own people enforce civil service laws, and that Congress make whistleblowing a legal defense to retaliatory criminal prosecutions.</p><p>It should not be legal to prosecute whistleblowers when it is illegal to fire them. This is inexcusable.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robert-greenwald\">Robert Greenwald</a>'s new film, <a href=\"http://www.waronwhistleblowers.com/\">War on Whistleblowers</a>, opens 19 April in New York City at the Quad and on 26 April in Los Angeles at Laemmle Music Hall.

His lawyers have resisted his removal since then in a series of appeals.</p><p>Although in other extradition cases the ECHR had not found that conditions in ADX Florence facility in Colorado were unacceptable, it deemed that Aswat's case was different because of his mental health condition.</p><p>In its judgment, the court said  it had given \"full consideration to the submissions of the US department of justice&nbsp;… and observed, in particular, that it could not be determined with certainty in which detention facility or facilities Mr Aswat would be placed if extradited to the USA, either before or after trial.</p><p>\"It was also unclear how long he might expect to remain on remand pending trial. As for his detention following a possible conviction&nbsp;… although Mr Aswat would have access to mental health services regardless of which prison he was be detained in, his extradition to a country where he had no ties and where he would face an uncertain future in an as yet undetermined institution, and possibly be subjected to the highly restrictive regime in ADX Florence, would violate article 3 of the convention.\"</p><p>Article 3 of the European convention on human rights prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment. Last year, the ECHR allowed the extradition of Babar Ahmad and four other suspects to US federal supermax prisons where inmates can spend 22 or 23 hours a day in solitary confinement.</p><p>After years of wrangling, Hamza was also finally extradited to the US to face terrorism charges. Aswat was told by Hamza to help set up the camp in Oregon in 1999, US officials believe. Aswat and another man, it is alleged, visited the proposed site of the camp in Bly that year.</p><p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are disappointed that the European court of human rights found that extradition to America would breach Haroon Aswat's human rights.</p><p>\"The judgment does not become final for three months and we will consider as a matter of urgency all the legal options which are available to us. This includes whether we request a referral of the case to the court's grand chamber.\"</p><p>In a separate ruling, the court of appeal in London quashed the indeterminate sentences given to three members of an al-Qaida-inspired terror group that plotted to bomb the London Stock Exchange and build a terrorist training camp.</p><p>The court instead imposed \"determinate\" custodial sentences of 17 years and eight months in the case of one of them and 16 years in relation to the others.</p><p>The Islamist extremists had originally received the indeterminate sentences for public protection at London's Woolwich crown court in February last year.</p><p>The ECHR last year ruled as \"arbitrary and unlawful\" the operation of indeterminate sentences for the protection of the public (IPPs), currently being served by more than 6,000 prisoners in England and Wales. The IPP sentence is being replaced by a new extended determinate sentence.</p><p>Mohammed Shahjahan, now 29, was last year ordered to serve a minimum of eight years and 10 months, while fellow Stoke-on-Trent-based radicals Usman Khan, 22, and Nazam Hussain, 27, were ordered to serve at least eight years behind bars.</p><p>Allowing their sentence appeals, Lord Justice Leveson, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Sweeney, ruled that Shahjahan now has to serve 17 years and eight months, and Khan and Hussain 16 years.</p><p>All three received extended sentences meaning that each will have to spend an extra five years on licence after their release. The trio were originally sentenced along with six others - four of the nine were from Stoke, three from Cardiff and two from London.</p><p>The appeal judges said that having reduced the three sentences by removing the sentence for public protection, they had come to the conclusion that it was right to make a marginal adjustment to the term imposed on another appellant.</p><p>They knocked six months off the five-year sentence given to Mohibur Rahman, now 28, from Stoke-on-Trent, for possessing two copies of the online al-Qaida magazine Inspire for terrorist purposes.</p><p>The judges also dismissed a sentence appeal by Omar Latif, 29, from Cardiff, who was jailed for 10 years and four months, with an extended period on licence of another five years, for attending meetings with the intention of assisting others to prepare or commit acts of terrorism.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/european-court-of-human-rights\">European court of human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/court-of-appeal\">Court of appeal</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott\">Owen Bowcott</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vikramdodd\">Vikram Dodd</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It obstructs good government. It undermines the rule of law.\"</p><p>Heaton's report coincides with the launch of a \"good law initiative\" aimed at simplifying legislation, particularly the way it is presented through the government website <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">legislation.gov.uk</a>.</p><p>One of the initiative's ambitions is to \"talk to the judges who authoritatively interpret the law and to the universities which teach it, to avoid confusion and facilitate interpretation\".</p><p>It also plans to \"ensure that legislation is as accessible as possible, and consider what more can be done to improve readability\".</p><p>The scheme is backed by Andrew Lansley, the leader of the House of Commons, who said: \"As MP and minister, I am well aware of how challenging it is to legislate in a way which effectively, simply and consistently promotes the interests of the people we serve, without creating delay or uncertainty.\"</p><p>Parliamentary drafting has evolved a more comprehensible form of English since the 19th century but interpreting the law remains an exercise almost exclusively undertaken by experienced lawyers.</p><p>The report records that the average number of government bills in a typical parliamentary session is currently between 35 and 50 depending on the length of the session. Between 1983 and 2009 parliament approved more than 100 criminal justice bills and more than 4,000 new criminal offences were created.</p><p>The amount of so-called \"delegated legislation\", involving statutory instruments, has increased significantly in recent decades from around 2,000 a year in the 1980s to around double that number in 2006.</p><p>Frustration at the intricacy and entanglements of the statute book are not new. The report quotes Edward VI (1537-1553) as lamenting: \"I wish that the superfluous and tedious statutes were brought into one sum together, and made more plain and short.\"</p><p>There are more than a million words of law governing immigration controls, the good law project has discovered, far more than the number of words written by Shakespeare. Such complexity may, understandably, baffle even UK Border Agency officials.</p><p>Another confusing tradition is that bills going through parliament refer to \"clauses\", but when they become acts they become \"sections\".</p><p>The initiative is intended to complement the government's campaign against red tape and bureaucracy. \"Users perceive complying with legislation to be onerous and the law as being extremely difficult to navigate,\" the report says. \"In particular, in the areas of planning and environmental applications, procedural bureaucracy is perceived to be a problem for businesses.\"</p><p>It adds: \"Most European countries have set up processes to simplify national legislation and established departments dedicated entirely to better regulation and reform of the law.\"</p><p>Cutting down on the number of protracted appeals up through the hierarchy of the courts to ascertain the precise meaning of some obscure legislative clause is one aspiration of the project.</p><p>Computer-assisted analysis of statutes could help untangle the more impenetrable recesses of the law, the report suggests. \"Computational legal studies emerged over a decade ago in the US and are based on the premise that legislation, as any other sets of complex and intertwined information, can be analysed and organised according to mathematical models.</p><p>\"If we look at statutes as data, then legislation can be formalised (and visualised) as a mathematical object, a hierarchically organised structure containing language and explicit interdependence between provisions.\"</p><p>The prospect of judges peering over their computer terminals at the plaintiff may not be so distant.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/houseofcommons\">House of Commons</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott\">Owen Bowcott</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Latifa Bouabdillah was sacked by Commerzbank after less than a month when her boss heard she was suing her former employer, Deutsche Bank, for more than £1m in damages for sexual discrimination.</p><p>An employment tribunal ruled on Monday that Commerzbank had \"victimised [Bouabdillah] for having brought sex discrimination proceedings against her former employer and subjected her to the detrimental dismissal\".</p><p>But it rejected the sexual discrimination charge and the bank said it was \"considering its legal options with regards to the other part of the claim\".</p><p>A \"remedy hearing\" is scheduled for September, at which Bouabdillah will claim for £13m in damages.</p><p>The tribunal said Commerzbank had an \"immediate and emotional response\" to discovering that Bouabdillah was suing her former employer for sex discrimination. \"We find they were uncomfortable with this and decided not to continue with the relationship because this was not the sort of person they wanted to employ,\" the tribunal said in its judgment.</p><p>She resigned as a vice-president at Deutsche Bank in 2011 and launched a lawsuit claiming her male colleagues were promoted ahead of her and received three times the bonuses that she did.</p><p>Bouabdillah was sacked by Commerzbank on 11 June 2012 – six days after her case against Deutsche Bank became public, following press coverage. It was less than a month after she had started work at Commerzbank.</p><p>Commerzbank had claimed that her case against Deutsche Bank had put the reputation of her new employer \"at risk\" and had broken the bank's trust.</p><p>Her boss, Guy Middleton, had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/mar/19/banker-sacked-sex-bias-case\" title=\"\">told the tribunal</a>that he was suspicious about why she had left Deutsche Bank and repeatedly asked her recruitment consultant, but was assured it was because she wanted to move to a smaller team.</p><p>\"I was initially unsure whether Latifa should remain in the team as I initially thought that the trust between her and the team might be recoverable,\" Middleton, head of Commerzbank's sales and trading at its exotic vanilla funds team, told the tribunal. \"But as time went on I felt that she had made a conscious and considered decision to withhold information, which made me feel that she could no longer be trusted.\"</p><p>The tribunal ruled that Commerzbank had been \"both offensive and unfair\" in claiming that Bouabdillah should have informed them of her sexual discrimination case against Deutsche Bank in the same way that bankers are required to disclose legal action against themselves.</p><p>The judgement ruled that Bouabdillah had not misled Commerzbank. \"When asked direct questions she gave direct answers,\" it said. \"They may not have been entirely full answers but that is not a matter of misleading or being dishonest … The failure to answer questions that were not asked does not in our view amount to a lack of honesty or trust.\"</p><p>It added: \"There is no evidence that the claimant [Bouabdillah] at any stage neglected her duties to the bank and there is no suggestion that she acted unprofessionally in any of her dealings albeit she had not been at the bank very long.\"</p><p>A Commerzbank spokesman said: \" [She] was dismissed for a breach of trust and confidence after having failed adequately to disclose the true reasons for leaving her former employer.

It is of critical importance that the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/public-sector-equality-duty/faqs-on-the-equality-duty/\" title=\"\">general equality duty</a> – which the House of Lords voted, with a significant majority, to retain on 4 March – is not overturned or repealed during the last stage of the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/enterpriseandregulatoryreform.html\" title=\"\">enterprise and regulatory reform bill</a> in the Commons today, 16 April.</p><p>The government has said that the objective of its reforms to the Equality and Human Rights Commission is to focus on the areas where it can add value because of its unique role and functions. It has failed to explain how the commission, which has already been&nbsp;significantly slimmed down, with fewer powers at its disposal, can be more effective than one that retains the role and powers given by parliament&nbsp;only six&nbsp;years ago.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats, along with all parties at the time, supported a strong general duty. We are now told by the government that this is \"too wide-ranging, and creates unrealistic expectations\". We are also told that it would make \"little difference\" to the work of the commission. Then why bother to remove it?</p><p>Liberal Democrats&nbsp;are committed to a fair and equal society, and for this reason we strongly believe it is important that all Lib Dem MPs support the amendment voted on in the House of Lords to stop the repeal of this fundamental equality law.</p><p>We also believe that the government has a choice between a strong independent body that is committed to promoting and safeguarding our values, independent of the government of the day – of whichever colour – or we go for the option of a watered-down, less independent, weaker institution, which in time would be rendered merely an enforcement agency or regulator without the vision and underpinning that is so important.</p><p>The general equality duty is a result of hard-fought rights following the tragedy of the Stephen Lawrence case, and it is such an important part of the legacy of the fight for justice that Doreen Lawrence wrote to the prime minister urging&nbsp;that it is retained. We hope that&nbsp;he&nbsp;and the government will listen to her&nbsp;plea.

The policy is known in Whitehall as NCND.</p><p>There were concerns about the \"repercussions for the relations between HMG [Her Majesty's government] and the US\" , Kovats said.</p><p>If that US embassy cable was authenticated, people would call for other cables to be admitted, Kovats told Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Mitting.</p><p>There was a \"real distinction\" between a document and information, he said. Kovats said Nigel Pleming QC, counsel for a group of Chagos islanders, could question Roberts about his meeting with US officials in May 2009 and newspaper articles referring to it, but not about the contents of the leaked cable.</p><p>Questioned by Pleming, Roberts denied he had said the marine reserve idea was a plan with an \"ulterior motive\" – namely, to prevent the islanders from returning.</p><p>Pleming is representing Louis Bancoult, chairman of the Chagos Refugees Group, who has seized on the leaked cable to argue in the British courts that the decision to impose a marine reserve announced by the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, in 2010, should be declared unlawful.</p><p>The inhabitants of the archipelago were removed in the 1960s and 1970s when the UK agreed that the US could build a large military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.</p><p>That decision, and the subsequent decision to impose a marine reserve area, will have to be justified before an international tribunal.</p><p>In an unexpected ruling earlier this year the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague ruled that Britain would have to justify its decision before a full hearing of the tribunal. An attempt by the UK to challenge the court's jurisdiction was defeated.</p><p>The Mauritian prime minister, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, has said the decision to establish a 545,000 sq mile marine reserve was carried out in defiance of assurances given to him at the time by the then prime minister, Gordon Brown.</p><p>The BIOT was established in 1965 when Britain expelled the Chagos islanders and allowed the US to set up a large base in a deal that included cutting the cost of Polaris missiles for the UK's nuclear submarines.</p><p>The agreement signed by the US and UK in 1966 expires in 2016. Both parties must agree to extend, modify or end it by December&nbsp;2014.

Jane Nicklinson said she would \"support 100% anyone who is willing to take the case forward. I hope that Tony's contribution can help, and I am happy for anything he has said to be used to further the case. At the very least he has left a legacy.\"</p><p>On 13 March this year, a high court judge agreed to let Lamb take over Nicklinson's appeal. This week the court agreed that Lamb could be named publicly after he told them he was ready to die. \"I cannot carry on as all that my life consists of is being fed and watered,\" he said in a witness statement. He needed help to end his life, he said: \"I am simply not in a position to take tablets, jump off a tall building, hang myself, throw myself in front of a moving train.\"</p><p>His case will be joined to another brought by Jane Nicklinson, appealing against the judgment that condemned her husband to a life he no longer wanted to lead.</p><p>She is able to pursue a claim in her own right under article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European convention. \"She suffered pain, distress and injury as a result of having to witness the cruel, distressing and painful life her husband suffered as he was not able to end his own life,\" said her solicitor, Saimo Chahal.</p><p>The two cases will now be heard in the court of appeal in May.</p><p>Nicklinson's lawyers had argued that the law should be changed so that a doctor who helped him to end his life when he chose could plead a defence of necessity to a charge of murder. But the court said that \"changes involving matters of controversial social policy\" were for parliament, and rejected Nicklinson's claim.</p><p>Lamb, a father of two like Nicklinson, told the Guardian in an interview at his home in Leeds that he wanted the right to end his life at a time and place of his choosing. \"When the end comes, I want it to be in here, in that bed,\" he said, jutting his head towards the bed in his house in the Bramley area of the city. \"I want to end my life in a peaceful, dignified way.\"</p><p>He was going public, he said, after seeing a video of Nicklinson learning that he had lost his appeal, his whole useless body convulsed by sobs. \"It was nothing short of cruel. You do wonder sometimes, the people who make these decisions. They're not the ones in constant pain, unable to do anything for themselves.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's something I believe in passionately. If I can be of any use to change the law, then I'll do it. Eventually the law will change. It has to. It might not be me who changes it. Maybe it will be 10 more people like me down the line. But it will change.\"</p><p>Lamb, a big man with a dry sense of humour, was left with quadriplegia and has no function in any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand after crashing his car into a lamp-post on 21 July 1990. It is unclear what happened, but he may have fallen asleep at the wheel and was probably not wearing a seatbelt.</p><p>Lamb suffers constant and chronic pain in his left shoulder – a pain no medication can dull, though morphine or ketamine make the condition somewhere approaching bearable. He also gets engulfed periodically by waves of depression, but is currently off the anti-depressants. \"I just feel sad about the pointlessness of my life,\" he said.</p><p>His wife divorced him in 2009, but he said his friends and family supported his decision. \"My son [aged 33] said he was so proud of me,\" said Lamb.</p><p>In his witness statement, Lamb explained why he wants the legal right to die.</p><p>\"With my level of disability it is not feasible to avail myself of the right of suicide; a right which I have in theory but not in practice … so the law does discriminate against me by on the one hand giving me a right to end my life, but on the other hand it is not a right I can actually use because of my disabilities. This just does not make sense to me. It seems like a cruel trick on me. I could starve myself, but that does not seem a very dignified way of ending my life and it would be cruel, painful and distressing for my sister and son to witness as well as my carers.</p><p>\"In the last 23 years I have endured a significant amount of pain. I am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have received input from various pain specialists. I have considered having operations. I am constantly on morphine. I suffer from severe pains in the back of my head. I suffer from a pain in my shoulders where the bone has worn away.</p><p>\"I consider that I have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot. Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel that I cannot and do not want to keep living. I feel trapped by the situation and I have no way out.</p><p>\"Over the past 23 years I have given it my best shot in trying to live as fully as I can, but I am now ready to go. People tell me that I must keep trying – but there is only so much that a person can take.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/assisted-suicide\">Assisted dying</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/tony-nicklinson\">Tony Nicklinson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd\">Helen Pidd</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He needed help to end his life, he said: \"I am simply not in a position to take tablets, jump off a tall building, hang myself, throw myself in front of a moving train.\"</p><p>His case will be joined to another brought by Jane Nicklinson, appealing against the judgment that condemned her husband to a life he no longer wanted to lead.</p><p>She is able to pursue a claim in her own right under article 8 (right to private and family life) of the European convention. \"She suffered pain, distress and injury as a result of having to witness the cruel, distressing and painful life her husband suffered as he was not able to end his own life,\" said her solicitor, Saimo Chahal.</p><p>The two cases will now be heard in the court of appeal in May.</p><p>Nicklinson's lawyers had argued that the law should be changed so that a doctor who helped him to end his life when he chose could plead a defence of necessity to a charge of murder. But the court said that \"changes involving matters of controversial social policy\" were for parliament, and rejected Nicklinson's claim.</p><p>Lamb, a father of two like Nicklinson, told the Guardian in an interview at his home in Leeds that he wanted the right to end his life at a time and place of his choosing. \"When the end comes, I want it to be in here, in that bed,\" he said, jutting his head towards the bed in his house in the Bramley area of the city. \"I want to end my life in a peaceful, dignified way.\"</p><p>He was going public, he said, after seeing a video of Nicklinson learning that he had lost his appeal, his whole useless body convulsed by sobs. \"It was nothing short of cruel. You do wonder sometimes, the people who make these decisions. They're not the ones in constant pain, unable to do anything for themselves.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's something I believe in passionately. If I can be of any use to change the law, then I'll do it. Eventually the law will change. It has to. It might not be me who changes it. Maybe it will be 10 more people like me down the line. But it will change.\"</p><p>Lamb, a big man with a dry sense of humour, was left with quadriplegia and has no function in any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand after crashing his car into a lamp-post on 21 July 1990. It is unclear what happened, but he may have fallen asleep at the wheel and was probably not wearing a seatbelt.</p><p>Lamb suffers constant and chronic pain in his left shoulder – a pain no medication can dull, though morphine or ketamine make the condition somewhere approaching bearable. He also gets engulfed periodically by waves of depression, but is currently off the anti-depressants. \"I just feel sad about the pointlessness of my life,\" he said.</p><p>His wife divorced him in 2009, but he said his friends and family supported his decision. \"My son [aged 33] said he was so proud of me,\" said Lamb.</p><p>In his witness statement, Lamb explained why he wants the legal right to die.</p><p>\"With my level of disability it is not feasible to avail myself of the right of suicide; a right which I have in theory but not in practice … so the law does discriminate against me by on the one hand giving me a right to end my life, but on the other hand it is not a right I can actually use because of my disabilities. This just does not make sense to me. It seems like a cruel trick on me. I could starve myself, but that does not seem a very dignified way of ending my life and it would be cruel, painful and distressing for my sister and son to witness as well as my carers.</p><p>\"In the last 23 years I have endured a significant amount of pain. I am in pain every single hour of every single day. I have received input from various pain specialists. I have considered having operations. I am constantly on morphine. I suffer from severe pains in the back of my head. I suffer from a pain in my shoulders where the bone has worn away.</p><p>\"I consider that I have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot. Now I feel worn out and I am genuinely fed up with my life. I feel that I cannot and do not want to keep living. I feel trapped by the situation and I have no way out.</p><p>\"Over the past 23 years I have given it my best shot in trying to live as fully as I can, but I am now ready to go. People tell me that I must keep trying – but there is only so much that a person can take.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/assisted-suicide\">Assisted dying</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/tony-nicklinson\">Tony Nicklinson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd\">Helen Pidd</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There's no way of knowing for sure how many of the over 2 million Americans who are currently incarcerated were wrongfully convicted, but <a href=\"http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php\">studies estimate</a> that somewhere between 2 and 5% of them, which would amount to up to 100,000 people, may be innocent of their crimes.</p><p>What we do know, however, is that since 1989, more than 1,000 people, some of whom have spent decades in prison, <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf\">have been exonerated (pdf)</a>. We also know that of that number. more than half were black and male; and their treatment by the criminal justice system, post release, is not a whole lot better than it was prior to their incarceration.</p><p>In 1989, the 16-year-old Shareef Cousins was convicted on eyewitness testimony of a murder he didn't commit, and was sentenced to death. If you review <a href=\"http://louisianajusticeinstitute.blogspot.ie/2013/02/a-child-on-death-row-story-of-shareef.html\">the circumstances of his case</a> – there was no DNA evidence linking Cousin to the crime and there was actual video footage of him playing in a basketball league at the time of the murder – it's almost impossible to see how he could have been found guilty, never mind sentenced to die. When asked what he thought led to his speedy conviction, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/04/15/177341744/life-after-exoneration-for-the-victims-on-both-sides\">during a recent interview with NPR</a>, Cousins attributed his death penalty sentence, without hesitation, to his race:</p><blockquote><p>\"I think the most important factor that we cannot turn a blind eye to is that – the character of race, especially here in New Orleans. Anytime that there is a white victim who is murdered, it is more than likely that whoever is convicted of murdering that white victim is going to be sentenced to death.\"</p></blockquote><p>He went on to say that in such cases where the victim is white and the perpetrator is black, \"someone is going down for that crime and someone is going down for that crime fast.\" Apparently, in Cousin's case, it didn't matter that the black man who went down for the crime didn't actually commit it.</p><p>Cousins is not the only wrongfully accused black man who feels that his race played a key role in his arrest and conviction. In Dallas, Texas, several exonerees, most of whom are black and male, have formed a group called Freedom Fighters, which is being <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/936372184/freedom-fighters-documentary-film\">featured in an upcoming documentary</a>. Freedom Fighters was originally intended to act as a support group for the former prisoners, but has since expanded its role into a quasi-detective agency to investigate cases and help secure the release of other wrongfully incarcerated men and women.</p><p>One of the groups members, Johnnie Lindsey, was convicted of sexual assault and spent 26 years in prison before being exonerated. Fellow member Christopher Scott served 13 years of a life sentence for murder before being released. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/04/15/177067595/exoneree-detectives-fight-for-those-still-behind-bars\">Also speaking with NPR</a>, Scott said that he and his colleagues were mostly convicted on eyewitness testimony only. And when the suspect in a crime was black and male, it didn't seem to matter a whole lot <em>which</em> black male ended up being charged.</p><blockquote><p>\"At that time, all of us being convicted of a crime, all of us fit the same type of description, man. A mid-aged guy, medium height, medium weight, with a low haircut. How many people you describing when you describe that?\"</p></blockquote><p>The current district attorney in Dallas County, Craig Watkins, summed up the attitude of former prosecutors in the state whose careless work led to many of these wrongful convictions as follows:</p><blockquote><p>\"A good prosecutor can get a guilty verdict on a person that's guilty. But a great prosecutor is one that can get a guilty verdict on an innocent individual.\"</p></blockquote><p>The fact that Dallas County makes the top ten list for wrongful convictions rates and that the majority of those exonerees are black and male, does not speak well to the racist tendencies of those shamefully unscrupulous prosecutors. At least <a href=\"http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/LawViewstate1.php?state=TX\">in the state of Texas</a>, exonerated individuals are reasonably well compensated (at a rate of at least $80,000 per year served) for the injustice done to them.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.innocenceproject.org/fix/Compensation.php\">According to the Innocence Project</a>, however, 23 states in the union have no statues in place to provide restitution to exonerees. And even in the 27 states that do have statutes in place (such as New York, for instance), the laws often only provide the exoneree with the right to file a damages claim within a specified time after his or her release.</p><p>At the time that Cousins was released from prison in New Orleans, another district that makes <a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf\">the top ten list for wrongful convictions (pdf)</a>, there were no restitution laws, so he was not compensated for the five years he spent on death row. It wasn't until a few years ago that the state of Louisiana put a law in place that says a petitioner may be eligible for $25,000 per year served, with a cap of $250,000, if his conviction has been vacated and if he can prove his factual innocence.</p><p>Cousins attributes this grudging compensation law in Louisiana to race, also:</p><blockquote><p>\"And so now I bring that back to what I was saying the first time, to race. You know, a lot of – the majority of – our guys that have been exonerated here in Louisiana have been black men. So we have $12 an hour for a maximum of 10 years [for guys] that were spending 30 years in prison.</p><p>\"So I guess our legislature is saying that, well, you're a black man: for 20 years, you probably wouldn't have been employed, anyway.\"</p></blockquote><p>So, it would seem that in many jurisdictions across America low-income black men are deemed worthless not only before they get unjustly sucked into the criminal justice system, but also after being exonerated. It's time to face up to the rampant racism that allows this situation to exist.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights\">Human rights</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality\">Equality</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sadhbh-walshe\">Sadhbh Walshe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I'm Annie Kelly and in this episode we'll be looking at the hugely complex issue of modern-day slavery. We'll be asking why more than 150 years after global slavery was abolished, an estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour. What does slavery look like in today's globalised labour market? And who is profiting from the global trade in people? We'll discuss these issues in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>According to the United Nations, people-trafficking is the world's third largest criminal industry. And the international labour organisation estimates the profits from global forced labour to be at least $44bn a year. But as we'll hear later, reliable data on this issue is thin on the ground, making it difficult to really assess the scale and scope of the modern-day slave trade.</p><p></p><p>With me today I have three guests who've been tackling these issues head on. But before we get into the discussion let's hear from Leonardo Sakamoto, a journalist and activist, who's been tracking forced and bonded labour in the Brazilian Amazon and pioneering what he considers a new approach to ending the criminal exploitation he's witnessed there.</p><p></p><p>I spoke to him earlier today and started by asking him how the slave trade operates in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> Slave labour is illegal in Brazil since May 13 1888, of course, but this kind of exploitation is still used in the way of cutting costs in the very competitive environment. You have slave labour. You have illegal work connected in legal networks of trades, of networks of production in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you've witnessed first-hand in Brazil, so the conditions of some of the workers engaged in this kind of forced labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> The conditions depends where the place where the workers were found in the slave labour situation. When you see workers in areas in the Amazon, the conditions are the worst possible. The workers don't receive enough food for their needs. The workers, they must make camps inside the jungle. The workers don't have access to salaries. The workers are sometimes are threatened to death. And sometimes the workers have to pay for their own tools to work. Sometimes you see very big cattle ranches – there is a care of the workers that is smaller than the care of the cattle.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Why or how is this being allowed to continue in Brazil?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> They used to say here in Brazil that slavery is sustained by a tripod: poverty, impunity and greed. And of course poverty is a very bad condition, the lack of opportunities. We're not talking about just money, we're talking about the conditions to have a good life. And this is the first. And they push the workers to try jobs in very far places with no share that we receive, for example.</p><p></p><p>Second, we have the impunity even [though] the Brazilian government, Brazilian state, has been getting good goals, good advances [in] the last 18 years of fighting against slavery in the country. We're still facing problems to get rich people that are using slave labour in jail, for example.</p><p></p><p>And the third, of course, people use slave labour in Brazil not because they are evil, we're not talking about … it's not a moral issue it's about an economic issue. The people use slave labour in the way to cutting down costs in their production.</p><p></p><p>I like to say that slavery is not a disease, slavery is a symptom. If you take malaria, for example, if you use just a medicine, just a pill to headache you will die. In the same way if you stay and rescue workers, for example, it's good everybody will see it's OK, it's good to rescue workers but we need to go beyond not just rescue workers but to change our model of development; that is the disease. Our model of development excludes concentrate wealth and create problems, for example, to the worker that has their own lands to plant and to produce. And this model is seen in the last ways responsible for the slavery in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Leonardo Sakamoto talking to me earlier from Brazil. So on the panel today: on the line from Beirut we have Beate Andrees, head of the special action programme to combat forced labour at the International Labour Organisation; and with me in the studio Romana Cacchioli from Anti-Slavery International; and Andrew Wallis, the chief executive of Unseen, a UK-based anti-trafficking organisation. Thank you all for taking part.</p><p></p><p>So let's get into it. What exactly do we mean when we talk about modern-day slavery? Romana, can you help us define this?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Well for people at the coal face, if you like, in slavery it's about being treated as property. It's about being controlled. It's about a denial of all their rights and I mean all of those rights. It's about being forced to work, coerced to work under threat. It's about having your freedom of movement curtailed and, in some cases, people fall into slavery or are forced into slavery because of debt. Other times it's because of the low status of individuals get caught up in debts or in situations where they can't remove themselves. So, essentially, for people in slavery, it's about control and it's about being treated as property and as a workforce, an engine to be exploited for, usually, commercial gain, for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate, slavery is obviously defined in various international conventions and under various international codes of law. Can you just explain a little bit about that and how slavery is defined on an international legal platform?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes indeed. There are a variety of international instruments to define slavery and related practice such as forced labour, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. The first instrument was adopted in 1926 by the League of Nations, the slavery convention. And then we had subsequent instruments; one, for instance, adopted by the ILO in 1930 defining forced labour. And then the most recent one, the trafficking in persons protocol adopted by the UN in 2000.</p><p></p><p>I think what's the common element of all these definitions is pretty much what Romana just said; it's the element of coercion, it's the element of overbearing a person's power and it's often through deceit, false promises, a way of treating people as commodities and not as workers, restraining their free choices and decision-making power over the conditions of their work. So, essentially, the key element is really coercion. These forms of coercion can be very subtle in modern times. People are not held in chains; in most of the cases they are really, in principle, free to, by law at least, to leave, but they are constrained. And that's precisely what [constitutes] slavery today.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And that's a very complex issue isn't it, because you ask where do you draw that line between cheap labour or exploited labour and then forced or slave labour. I mean …</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Absolutely.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, do you think that part of the problem is that slavery in today's globalised labour market is really hard to define and it's really hard for consumers to recognise as well?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Yes it is. It's also really important in terms of how we express what slavery is, how we understand it because that then leads to how we're going to tackle it. So, for me, I think the understanding around it is a form of illicit trade where a human being has been commodified in order to earn their slaver vast profits, in some cases with very little risk of being caught. And so the motivation for someone commodifying and enslaving someone is a financial motivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that then works out in terms of the globalised labour trade because there are two issues at play: one is the demand that we have for cheap goods. And as soon as you put that demand into the equation it works its way down a supply chain and creates vulnerabilities where you're going to have to have slaves involved. And on the other side you have an illicit trade with very smart business people that are looking to make profit and their commodity is trading in human beings.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, Andrew's raised some really interesting points there. I wanted to ask you why is it that the ILO uses the term \"forced labour\" instead of the word \"slavery\"? Can you tell me about some of the subtleties around that?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well first of all it's because we … by mandate from the Forced Labour Convention that was adopted in 1930 in which it was very much meant as a complementary tool to the slavery convention, it was meant to address, in particular, state-imposed forced labour, and at the time, forced labour imposed by the colonial states in particular. One problem I have with the notion of trade and the definition which you have in the slavery convention, the condition of ownership, it kinds of misleads us in understanding the more subtle and modern forms of slavery. And I think what you have in the definition of forced labour, the ILO definition, is basically the focus on coercion, it's the manners of penalty, it's to understand how people are constrained in their choices.</p><p></p><p>So sometimes these people end up in a situation of forced labour without any deception, without any intermediary; they're not being traded in a sense as they were traded 200 years ago. They just end up in a situation of forced labour because they're in a very vulnerable situation and they have no bargaining power. So I think in this sense the definition of forced labour is very helpful because it helps us focus on the exploitation and less so on the transaction that may or may not precede a situation of exploitation.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> I guess one of the problems is when you've got a word like coercion it's really, really hard to define exactly what is coercion and what is willingness on the part of the person who is being exploited. I mean, Romana, in terms of your work at Anti-Slavery International, how do you see those issues playing out?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I would totally agree with what Beate's saying, actually. I think that sometimes it is a bit of a distraction really to focus too much on the issue, to sort of look at it in terms of a trade and a movement of people, because actually what we're really all working towards is to stop the exploitation, the gross exploitation of people. So I also agree with Beate that the Forced Labour Convention is the most helpful because that's what covers most of the forms, the contemporary forms of slavery today in the world, whether we're looking at bonded labour in South Asia or even child labour, the worst forms of child labour; trafficking is the movement of people. But at the end of that there has to be an exploitation and, for the most part, that is in labour exploitation; the big numbers of people who are trafficked are in fact trafficked for labour. And the coercion is central.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And we heard Leonardo earlier saying that this wasn't a moral issue it was an economic issue, Andrew, would you agree with that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think it can be both because I think in some of the equation, the morality is around the demand that then creates the environment for that slavery to exist. But maybe the dividing line between what is exploitative behaviour and what then tips us over that line into slavery is around the issue of is that person free to leave. So if they're not, and that could be a whole number of reasons why they can't leave, they could just be in an exploitative situation but they could walk away from that situation. Is that slavery? For my definition, no, it isn't, because the moment that someone is not free to leave, they're coerced and they're controlled, they've become a commodity. And actually that state goes all the way back to slavery thousands of years ago, which is where a human being is a commodity. So in the Roman Empire, the view of a slave was, well, it's just like a hammer: I can use it as a tool and then if it breaks I just toss it away. That still exists today in terms of that's what slavery is. So, yes, that's a moral issue around should a fellow human being be viewed as just a commodity to be used?</p><p></p><p>But then the economic issues are also in play as well, in terms of complex supply chains, the desire to have cheap goods and all of that then plays in and creates an environment in which the illicit trade in human beings can take place.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> It's probably quite a good moment now to read a comment from guardian.co.uk. One of our readers, <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/degutsdeybust/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">degutsdeybust</a> has just come back from working in India and he can't believe that the statistic of 21 million people trapped in forced labour can be accurate. But he says maybe it depends on the definitions. And he says: \"In India there are around 300 million people who are routinely excluded from normal life because of their caste and many who have no option but to work cleaning out latrines or sewers. How do we address this kind of slavery when people aren't necessarily forced into this work but when there are no other options? What's the difference between this and slavery?\" Romana, have you got anything to …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Yes, I do understand where he's coming from because it is really hard. And I'm sure Beate will also agree that it's very difficult to draw the line, so you have a continuum and I think that's how, as Andrew was saying, a continuum of practices of experiences from the worst end where people are really enslaved, they can't move, they're forced to work, all their rights are completely taken away from them; right down to exploitative labour; you know you're working overtime perhaps and not being paid for it. So a whole continuum range of experiences. In India, it is true and the majority of people who are in bonded labour are from the Dalit or tribal castes.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Can you just very briefly explain exactly what you mean by bonded labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> So, bonded labour is that people are coerced into forced labour, forced to work to pay off a debt. So they've incurred a debt often for either subsistence or to pay medical costs or marriage costs or even migration costs; in India that's what we're finding more and more is that people are migrating to work, they have to take a loan and then they end up working and not being paid and not being aware how much they owe. And that debt, then with interest, accrues and they may not be able to leave that job. They may be coerced, forced to work under threat of violence. And so there are many, many hundreds of thousands of people who are really in that very dire situation. But discrimination is pervasive in India and not everybody who is a Dalit or from a tribal group will be in a situation of bonded or forced labour.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, Beate, you heard there that our commenter doesn't believe that the ILO's figure of 21 million people can be accurate. Do you believe that it truly reflects the scale of the problem on a global level?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well, absolutely, otherwise we wouldn't have published it. But I should probably include one caveat and we said it very clearly in our report: that this is based on the best possible methodology and data available today. We think it is a conservative number, it could well be higher, it's unlikely that it is lower. But as long as we don't have reliable national estimates, we can't have a more reliable figure.</p><p></p><p>Now, of course, it depends a little bit, the scale of the problem, and the measurement depends on how you define it, that's very clear. We have based our estimate on the ILO's definition of forced labour, which means that the cases we have verified and counted as a forced labour case have to have an element or coercion. So the simple fact that you are in a vulnerable situation in itself is not forced labour. There has to be an intent on the part of the employer, the abuser, to exploit the person for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, really briefly, what conclusions do you believe we can draw from the fact that the ILO is saying that this is a conservative estimate because it's only based on the available national data that it's been able to acquire?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think there's three issues at play. One is the issue around definition; what are we talking about and where's the dividing line between what's slavery and what isn't? Whenever you have definitions that you've got to get governments to agree to you always have a race to the bottom; what's the lowest common denominator that everybody can agree on. So that then immediately skews your figures, I would argue.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, I think there's a systemic fear at government level and a society level to actually be honest and say, regardless of abolishing slavery 200 plus years ago, we still have slavery. So I think we have to have that honest debate at government level, at society level, that says this is still a problem that exists. Therefore you then get the impetus to actually shine a light on it. And that then leads to the data issue, which you know the ILO have identified it, we identified it in terms of the report that's just come out, which is to try and get hard and fast data is next to impossible for all the reasons that have just been listed. But also I think it's just this, do we want to lift this rock knowing underneath there's this gunk that we've got to look at. And my observation is we don't.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Well, thank you all.

Romana?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> A weak legal framework; so weak laws, weak enforcement; where we have laws they're not enforced. Discrimination, because often the people who are in situations of slavery come from groups that are marginalised in society and so they're very vulnerable. Other factors which, sort of push factors, if you like, can be conflict, migration and food scarcity issues which force families and their children out to work; it's a whole myriad really of push factors and reasons why slavery continues today and is with us today. Is that the question you asked me, I can't remember?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, have you got anything to add to that from your work collecting this data in your office at the ILO?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> I think Romana has summarised it very nicely. The key structural causes are very much linked to big institutions in a broad sense, not just laws but also ministries, governance in a broader sense. And the other one we see very clearly coming out of all of our research is indeed discrimination.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, your organisation, Unseen, was recently involved in a study looking at the scale of modern slavery here in the UK. What were the main points that you took from that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> So the Centre for Social Justice commissioned in effect what was a two-year, evidence-led review of what was the state of modern slavery in the United Kingdom. So, yes, it was UK-focused but obviously we were all aware of the global context. I think right off the top what we discovered was a lack of leadership on this issue. And probably problematic within that as well was wanting to see the issue framed just within an immigration debate. And yet if you look at the legal structure, the UK, and increasingly around the globe, what you have is legislation that views it as a criminal act. So you have a perpetrator of a crime and you have a victim of crime. And in the globalised world we need to move it away from just being a debate about immigration and I think we need to move it back to being a debate about: here is a crime that's taken place.</p><p></p><p>We also found that data was a big issue, which, in trying to ask the question what is the size of the problem, we took the decision very early on that we would not be able to answer that question. So here's a first-world country, and the UK government would admit this as well, that we have no handle on the data. The only data we have are those that have chosen to access the government's care programme. But we know, as an organisation, that isn't the true figure; and whether you talk to law enforcement, statutory agencies, everybody will tell you that is not a true figure.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And obviously behind that data are the people who are affected by this globalised labour situation. Let's hear from someone now with direct experience of being trafficked into the UK. Last week, reporter Harriet Grant interviewed a young woman originally from China, who says she was a victim of forced labour by a criminal gang. Her name's been changed to protect her identity.</p><p></p><p><strong>HG</strong> In a cramped bedsit in a northern English town Min talks about the man who brought her here from China. She tells me that her family were being harassed by the police because they were followers of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong. So her grandmother put her into the hands of a man who said he could help her get to Britain, where he said the government would offer her protection and the chance of a new life.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side. He brought me to a house where I stayed for a long time. I was just locked inside the house. They told me that I could not escape and if I tried they would kill my grandmother in China, that it was dangerous for me to escape.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>After taking a boat, then a train, still confused about where she was, their final destination was a cannabis factory in England where she was again held prisoner.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"I had to tend to the plants, water, pick them and fertilise them. They said that if I didn't my grandmother would have to pay money and that if I escaped they would kill her. I was really scared.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>In 2008, the police discovered the factory and closed it down. Despite telling them what had happened to her, Min was charged with cannabis cultivation and sentenced to 12 months in prison. It was only after she finished the sentence that the UK Border Agency acknowledged she was reasonably likely to be a victim of trafficking. Last year they wrote to Min saying that because she escaped from that situation, she cannot now be described as a victim of trafficking, even though they do accept she was under the control of her trafficker when arrested. The letter tells her that as a foreign criminal, she's now subject to deportation for the public good.</p><p></p><p>Min has a life in England now. She's pregnant and frightened about being sent home where her trafficker might find her. There's a test case at the Court of Appeal in May that is going to look at four cases similar to Min's. When I spoke to Min's lawyer, Hani Zubeidi at Fadiga & Co, he told me that he hopes these cases will set a precedent which will allow Min to challenge her own conviction. Until then she waits, unable to sleep at night, fearful of being sent home, branded a foreign criminal.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> That was Harriet Grant reporting and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/apr/07/human-traffic-victims-drug-factories\" title=\"\">you can read the full Observer article at guardian.co.uk</a>. So, Andrew, what does Min's case tell us about the failure of international efforts to tackle trafficking?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Unfortunately her case is atypical. Just going through her story, you've got issues of a misunderstanding around immigration; you have criminalisation of a victim; you have identification of that victim but then being told but you're still an immigrant therefore we're going to turf you out of the country. So not only do we not recognise the victim, but we then penalise that victim. And then that plays into other issues around what is the awareness within statutory agencies and front-line agencies of what is being presented in front of them. Is it a cannabis factory with a drug cultivator; or is it actually a victim of crime who is there against their will, who, under the threat of violence, coercion, fear of retribution to their family is held there and will work there? And then behind that you have, well, why are they in this country producing cannabis in the first place? Because society wants a demand for it. The UK is now net exporter of cannabis. So there's your pull factor into the UK. And where's our reintegration of survivors? That individual remains vulnerable. If returned to the situation where they've come from, in all likelihood will be retrafficked. And so there are so many issues at play that just basically shows you, to quote The Thick of It, an omnishambles of a response.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, do you have a response to that? Obviously, that goes back to a lot of what you were saying when you were defining forced labour for us at the beginning of the programme.</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes, absolutely. You have all the elements here: the deception, restriction of the freedom of movements, where that's a clear case of trafficking. And what it really shows is the failure of identification systems. It should have been, from the beginning, this person should have received assistance, there should have been no doubts about her circumstances. And yet it just didn't happen. And it's very symptomatic, particularly for workers and sectors that are informal, so, obviously, cannabis production is an illegal activity in most countries, but also the sex industry is a very typical, not being protected as victims of forced labour. The same is true for other activities like forced begging or more formal activities, domestic work and even construction and so on.</p><p></p><p>So I think it's a clear problem here to properly identify potential victims and then provide them with the necessary care.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> OK. And we had a question from a listener that kind of ties into this. <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/valentinacaron/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">ValentinaCaron</a>, who worked for an NGO in Cambodia, this is what she wrote to us. She said: \"It's a shame that western donors rarely include activities like police training, I'm not saying that giving money for children's education is less important, but I feel that police training could really change the legal environment in which the Cambodian people live. Without an effective implementation of the international standards that bind Cambodia, it would never be possible to have this justice.\" She's offering some kind of solution. Romana, obviously Anti-Slavery International, a global organisation, have you seen these kind of issues that play around …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Absolutely. I think we would all agree that we need better training and awareness-raising amongst law enforcement. But immigration officers, particularly on many of the borders in the global south, but also immigration officers in Europe, but all criminal justice actors. So for the UK it would be about the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, clearly being able to access, not just the police being able to identify a potential victim of trafficking but it's also the criminal justice actors all the way through, right through to judges. And also being able to communicate that to juries in trafficking trials so that clearly victims' stories are well represented because they're very complex stories often.</p><p></p><p>If we look at a couple of cases that have been held here in the UK on domestic servitude, trafficking for domestic servitude, where you've got issues around witchcraft and how children have been, or adults have been controlled through issues around witchcraft, this really needs to be unpacked, so there has to be a real understanding by all actors that are working to what are the patterns of trafficking, what are the coercive methods that are used? And what are the areas of exploitation, because as we've heard, cannabis … who would have thought that people are being trafficked into cannabis a few years ago? So this is an emerging area where now we're finding people are being trafficked into criminal activities like forced begging, many Roma and Bulgarians on the streets of London and elsewhere that are being forced to beg. And this is a new area.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Do you think that part of the problem is, is that it has evolved, it has changed? So if you ask maybe the average person on the street here in the UK: what is slavery today? they may think of children in brick kilns in Pakistan; they may not think that it happens here in the UK or in other developed nations. And I just wonder whether there was that problem with the language that's being used, people not understanding the different types of modern day slavery that are going on; what's the difference between someone who's been trafficked, what's the difference between that and migration patterns? It's a very complex language being used.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> It is complex. And it's also going back to that image of expecting people in slavery to be in chains, and it's not at all like that now. And it's not just people being locked into factories. It's also people, you know, could be working in a bar or in restaurants, in construction, so forced labour situations are really around us all the time. It's just that we're not seeing it in that sort of framework, really.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate was mentioning earlier that she felt that there had been progress made by some national governments in acknowledging this problem; I was wondering in terms of the anti-slavery movement, the NGOs, the civil society groups who are working on this issue, do you believe that you're really making an impact in global efforts to end slavery?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I think we are. Sometimes I think it's a drop in the ocean. But I think agree with Beate there has been a movement over the last few years to recognise the issue and the importance of the issue. Over the last 10 years the issue has become more and more at the top of the political agenda. Of course we're not there yet. I wouldn't want to pat anybody on the back, we need to do a lot more. In terms of civil society I think there are lots more … we've got business that are coming on board now as well, so I think it's about everybody being involved in this campaign, everybody being aware of what it is and being able to identify it and report it to the authorities when they see it.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Andrew, you actually come from a corporate background, don't you? I was wondering what your views on this might be? Do you think that things need to change if we're really going to make strides forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I'm going to be slightly controversial and I think what we've got better at is identifying it. Have we got better at eradicating it? I don't think we have. And I think it's an issue of systems process. So systems deliver processes and deliver results. And if you look across the globe and say, well, what are the results five years, 10 years, 100 years? The results are we have slaves. The results are: there are very few prosecutions. The results are: it's a high-return, low-risk industry to be involved in. And if you approach it as a commercial business, and back to what I was saying earlier about let's frame it as an illicit trade, and let's understand that the people that get involved in this and turn human beings into a commodity are doing it for business reasons, they're doing it to make money, they're doing it to get a return on their commodity. Then, are we winning? No, we're not. And I think there's a whole list of reasons why we're not. I think governments are glued to bureaucratic response and traffickers are, like, fair enough, carry on doing that, because we're fast, we're nimble, we're lean and mean and we can evolve.</p><p></p><p>So I actually think we need to be honest with ourselves, be it the NGO community, government community or the business community, and say are we actually tackling this and dismantling it? And I would say we're not. I think we can do it. I think the tools are there to enable us to do it, but is the will there, is the political will there, is the will there amongst NGOs to do it, is the will there within society to change practices that create the demand and the pulls for slavery to exist?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, our appetite for cheap products as well, I imagine?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> For sure.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I do hear what you're saying, Andrew, but I do also think that things have come a long way, honestly, in the last 10 years. We wouldn't have been having this conversation. It was really difficult to get any journalist or anybody to talk about slavery and forced labour. And just in the last 10 years, when you see the proliferation of NGOs just in the UK working on this issue. I mean for a very long time, Anti-Slavery International was one of the only organisations working, and the ILO of course, Beate of course, and so there's a lot more awareness. I mean, clearly, there's a lot more to do. Clearly, in terms of business needs to also take its responsibilities. We need a transparent supply chain which is audited and that audit needs to be transparent. And we need accountability. Governments, yes, we do need to make it more of a priority but I do think we are making steps, I don't want to be the doom and gloom merchant, there are solutions out there because I've seen communities change. Empowerment can happen quite quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, are you optimistic about the way forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> It's an area where change will only emerge very slowly, because it's linked to a change of attitudes and behaviours of different groups of people, be it government, business and the people concerned. I'd like to come back quickly on the economic interest, because Andrew is also right in saying that as long as we don't understand these economic drivers, we won't really move the agenda forward. And that's very true. I mean, that's one of the reasons why we have worked on the profit figures, we will produce a new figure this year, it's most likely to be much higher than the one you have quoted in the beginning. We need to understand the economic interest and we need to get business involved. And it's very much on the ILO's agenda.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Fabulous. So, in conclusion, we need to really understand the money and who's profiting and understand it as a criminal business as well. Well, I'm afraid that's all we've got time for today.

I'm Annie Kelly and in this episode we'll be looking at the hugely complex issue of modern-day slavery. We'll be asking why more than 150 years after global slavery was abolished, an estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour. What does slavery look like in today's globalised labour market? And who is profiting from the global trade in people? We'll discuss these issues in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>According to the United Nations, people-trafficking is the world's third largest criminal industry. And the international labour organisation estimates the profits from global forced labour to be at least $44bn a year. But as we'll hear later, reliable data on this issue is thin on the ground, making it difficult to really assess the scale and scope of the modern-day slave trade.</p><p></p><p>With me today I have three guests who've been tackling these issues head on. But before we get into the discussion let's hear from Leonardo Sakamoto, a journalist and activist, who's been tracking forced and bonded labour in the Brazilian Amazon and pioneering what he considers a new approach to ending the criminal exploitation he's witnessed there.</p><p></p><p>I spoke to him earlier today and started by asking him how the slave trade operates in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> Slave labour is illegal in Brazil since May 13 1888, of course, but this kind of exploitation is still used in the way of cutting costs in the very competitive environment. You have slave labour. You have illegal work connected in legal networks of trades, of networks of production in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you've witnessed first-hand in Brazil, so the conditions of some of the workers engaged in this kind of forced labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> The conditions depends where the place where the workers were found in the slave labour situation. When you see workers in areas in the Amazon, the conditions are the worst possible. The workers don't receive enough food for their needs. The workers, they must make camps inside the jungle. The workers don't have access to salaries. The workers are sometimes are threatened to death. And sometimes the workers have to pay for their own tools to work. Sometimes you see very big cattle ranches – there is a care of the workers that is smaller than the care of the cattle.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Why or how is this being allowed to continue in Brazil?</p><p></p><p><strong>LS</strong> They used to say here in Brazil that slavery is sustained by a tripod: poverty, impunity and greed. And of course poverty is a very bad condition, the lack of opportunities. We're not talking about just money, we're talking about the conditions to have a good life. And this is the first. And they push the workers to try jobs in very far places with no share that we receive, for example.</p><p></p><p>Second, we have the impunity even [though] the Brazilian government, Brazilian state, has been getting good goals, good advances [in] the last 18 years of fighting against slavery in the country. We're still facing problems to get rich people that are using slave labour in jail, for example.</p><p></p><p>And the third, of course, people use slave labour in Brazil not because they are evil, we're not talking about … it's not a moral issue it's about an economic issue. The people use slave labour in the way to cutting down costs in their production.</p><p></p><p>I like to say that slavery is not a disease, slavery is a symptom. If you take malaria, for example, if you use just a medicine, just a pill to headache you will die. In the same way if you stay and rescue workers, for example, it's good everybody will see it's OK, it's good to rescue workers but we need to go beyond not just rescue workers but to change our model of development; that is the disease. Our model of development excludes concentrate wealth and create problems, for example, to the worker that has their own lands to plant and to produce. And this model is seen in the last ways responsible for the slavery in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Leonardo Sakamoto talking to me earlier from Brazil. So on the panel today: on the line from Beirut we have Beate Andrees, head of the special action programme to combat forced labour at the International Labour Organisation; and with me in the studio Romana Cacchioli from Anti-Slavery International; and Andrew Wallis, the chief executive of Unseen, a UK-based anti-trafficking organisation. Thank you all for taking part.</p><p></p><p>So let's get into it. What exactly do we mean when we talk about modern-day slavery? Romana, can you help us define this?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Well for people at the coal face, if you like, in slavery it's about being treated as property. It's about being controlled. It's about a denial of all their rights and I mean all of those rights. It's about being forced to work, coerced to work under threat. It's about having your freedom of movement curtailed and, in some cases, people fall into slavery or are forced into slavery because of debt. Other times it's because of the low status of individuals get caught up in debts or in situations where they can't remove themselves. So, essentially, for people in slavery, it's about control and it's about being treated as property and as a workforce, an engine to be exploited for, usually, commercial gain, for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate, slavery is obviously defined in various international conventions and under various international codes of law. Can you just explain a little bit about that and how slavery is defined on an international legal platform?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes indeed. There are a variety of international instruments to define slavery and related practice such as forced labour, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. The first instrument was adopted in 1926 by the League of Nations, the slavery convention. And then we had subsequent instruments; one, for instance, adopted by the ILO in 1930 defining forced labour. And then the most recent one, the trafficking in persons protocol adopted by the UN in 2000.</p><p></p><p>I think what's the common element of all these definitions is pretty much what Romana just said; it's the element of coercion, it's the element of overbearing a person's power and it's often through deceit, false promises, a way of treating people as commodities and not as workers, restraining their free choices and decision-making power over the conditions of their work. So, essentially, the key element is really coercion. These forms of coercion can be very subtle in modern times. People are not held in chains; in most of the cases they are really, in principle, free to, by law at least, to leave, but they are constrained. And that's precisely what [constitutes] slavery today.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And that's a very complex issue isn't it, because you ask where do you draw that line between cheap labour or exploited labour and then forced or slave labour. I mean …</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Absolutely.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, do you think that part of the problem is that slavery in today's globalised labour market is really hard to define and it's really hard for consumers to recognise as well?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Yes it is. It's also really important in terms of how we express what slavery is, how we understand it because that then leads to how we're going to tackle it. So, for me, I think the understanding around it is a form of illicit trade where a human being has been commodified in order to earn their slaver vast profits, in some cases with very little risk of being caught. And so the motivation for someone commodifying and enslaving someone is a financial motivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that then works out in terms of the globalised labour trade because there are two issues at play: one is the demand that we have for cheap goods. And as soon as you put that demand into the equation it works its way down a supply chain and creates vulnerabilities where you're going to have to have slaves involved. And on the other side you have an illicit trade with very smart business people that are looking to make profit and their commodity is trading in human beings.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, Andrew's raised some really interesting points there. I wanted to ask you why is it that the ILO uses the term \"forced labour\" instead of the word \"slavery\"? Can you tell me about some of the subtleties around that?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well first of all it's because we … by mandate from the Forced Labour Convention that was adopted in 1930 in which it was very much meant as a complementary tool to the slavery convention, it was meant to address, in particular, state-imposed forced labour, and at the time, forced labour imposed by the colonial states in particular. One problem I have with the notion of trade and the definition which you have in the slavery convention, the condition of ownership, it kinds of misleads us in understanding the more subtle and modern forms of slavery. And I think what you have in the definition of forced labour, the ILO definition, is basically the focus on coercion, it's the manners of penalty, it's to understand how people are constrained in their choices.</p><p></p><p>So sometimes these people end up in a situation of forced labour without any deception, without any intermediary; they're not being traded in a sense as they were traded 200 years ago. They just end up in a situation of forced labour because they're in a very vulnerable situation and they have no bargaining power. So I think in this sense the definition of forced labour is very helpful because it helps us focus on the exploitation and less so on the transaction that may or may not precede a situation of exploitation.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> I guess one of the problems is when you've got a word like coercion it's really, really hard to define exactly what is coercion and what is willingness on the part of the person who is being exploited. I mean, Romana, in terms of your work at Anti-Slavery International, how do you see those issues playing out?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I would totally agree with what Beate's saying, actually. I think that sometimes it is a bit of a distraction really to focus too much on the issue, to sort of look at it in terms of a trade and a movement of people, because actually what we're really all working towards is to stop the exploitation, the gross exploitation of people. So I also agree with Beate that the Forced Labour Convention is the most helpful because that's what covers most of the forms, the contemporary forms of slavery today in the world, whether we're looking at bonded labour in South Asia or even child labour, the worst forms of child labour; trafficking is the movement of people. But at the end of that there has to be an exploitation and, for the most part, that is in labour exploitation; the big numbers of people who are trafficked are in fact trafficked for labour. And the coercion is central.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And we heard Leonardo earlier saying that this wasn't a moral issue it was an economic issue, Andrew, would you agree with that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think it can be both because I think in some of the equation, the morality is around the demand that then creates the environment for that slavery to exist. But maybe the dividing line between what is exploitative behaviour and what then tips us over that line into slavery is around the issue of is that person free to leave. So if they're not, and that could be a whole number of reasons why they can't leave, they could just be in an exploitative situation but they could walk away from that situation. Is that slavery? For my definition, no, it isn't, because the moment that someone is not free to leave, they're coerced and they're controlled, they've become a commodity. And actually that state goes all the way back to slavery thousands of years ago, which is where a human being is a commodity. So in the Roman Empire, the view of a slave was, well, it's just like a hammer: I can use it as a tool and then if it breaks I just toss it away. That still exists today in terms of that's what slavery is. So, yes, that's a moral issue around should a fellow human being be viewed as just a commodity to be used?</p><p></p><p>But then the economic issues are also in play as well, in terms of complex supply chains, the desire to have cheap goods and all of that then plays in and creates an environment in which the illicit trade in human beings can take place.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> It's probably quite a good moment now to read a comment from guardian.co.uk. One of our readers, <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/degutsdeybust/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">degutsdeybust</a> has just come back from working in India and he can't believe that the statistic of 21 million people trapped in forced labour can be accurate. But he says maybe it depends on the definitions. And he says: \"In India there are around 300 million people who are routinely excluded from normal life because of their caste and many who have no option but to work cleaning out latrines or sewers. How do we address this kind of slavery when people aren't necessarily forced into this work but when there are no other options? What's the difference between this and slavery?\" Romana, have you got anything to …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Yes, I do understand where he's coming from because it is really hard. And I'm sure Beate will also agree that it's very difficult to draw the line, so you have a continuum and I think that's how, as Andrew was saying, a continuum of practices of experiences from the worst end where people are really enslaved, they can't move, they're forced to work, all their rights are completely taken away from them; right down to exploitative labour; you know you're working overtime perhaps and not being paid for it. So a whole continuum range of experiences. In India, it is true and the majority of people who are in bonded labour are from the Dalit or tribal castes.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Can you just very briefly explain exactly what you mean by bonded labour?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> So, bonded labour is that people are coerced into forced labour, forced to work to pay off a debt. So they've incurred a debt often for either subsistence or to pay medical costs or marriage costs or even migration costs; in India that's what we're finding more and more is that people are migrating to work, they have to take a loan and then they end up working and not being paid and not being aware how much they owe. And that debt, then with interest, accrues and they may not be able to leave that job. They may be coerced, forced to work under threat of violence. And so there are many, many hundreds of thousands of people who are really in that very dire situation. But discrimination is pervasive in India and not everybody who is a Dalit or from a tribal group will be in a situation of bonded or forced labour.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, Beate, you heard there that our commenter doesn't believe that the ILO's figure of 21 million people can be accurate. Do you believe that it truly reflects the scale of the problem on a global level?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Well, absolutely, otherwise we wouldn't have published it. But I should probably include one caveat and we said it very clearly in our report: that this is based on the best possible methodology and data available today. We think it is a conservative number, it could well be higher, it's unlikely that it is lower. But as long as we don't have reliable national estimates, we can't have a more reliable figure.</p><p></p><p>Now, of course, it depends a little bit, the scale of the problem, and the measurement depends on how you define it, that's very clear. We have based our estimate on the ILO's definition of forced labour, which means that the cases we have verified and counted as a forced labour case have to have an element or coercion. So the simple fact that you are in a vulnerable situation in itself is not forced labour. There has to be an intent on the part of the employer, the abuser, to exploit the person for financial gain.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, really briefly, what conclusions do you believe we can draw from the fact that the ILO is saying that this is a conservative estimate because it's only based on the available national data that it's been able to acquire?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I think there's three issues at play. One is the issue around definition; what are we talking about and where's the dividing line between what's slavery and what isn't? Whenever you have definitions that you've got to get governments to agree to you always have a race to the bottom; what's the lowest common denominator that everybody can agree on. So that then immediately skews your figures, I would argue.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, I think there's a systemic fear at government level and a society level to actually be honest and say, regardless of abolishing slavery 200 plus years ago, we still have slavery. So I think we have to have that honest debate at government level, at society level, that says this is still a problem that exists. Therefore you then get the impetus to actually shine a light on it. And that then leads to the data issue, which you know the ILO have identified it, we identified it in terms of the report that's just come out, which is to try and get hard and fast data is next to impossible for all the reasons that have just been listed. But also I think it's just this, do we want to lift this rock knowing underneath there's this gunk that we've got to look at. And my observation is we don't.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Well, thank you all.

Romana?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> A weak legal framework; so weak laws, weak enforcement; where we have laws they're not enforced. Discrimination, because often the people who are in situations of slavery come from groups that are marginalised in society and so they're very vulnerable. Other factors which, sort of push factors, if you like, can be conflict, migration and food scarcity issues which force families and their children out to work; it's a whole myriad really of push factors and reasons why slavery continues today and is with us today. Is that the question you asked me, I can't remember?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, have you got anything to add to that from your work collecting this data in your office at the ILO?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> I think Romana has summarised it very nicely. The key structural causes are very much linked to big institutions in a broad sense, not just laws but also ministries, governance in a broader sense. And the other one we see very clearly coming out of all of our research is indeed discrimination.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Andrew, your organisation, Unseen, was recently involved in a study looking at the scale of modern slavery here in the UK. What were the main points that you took from that?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> So the Centre for Social Justice commissioned in effect what was a two-year, evidence-led review of what was the state of modern slavery in the United Kingdom. So, yes, it was UK-focused but obviously we were all aware of the global context. I think right off the top what we discovered was a lack of leadership on this issue. And probably problematic within that as well was wanting to see the issue framed just within an immigration debate. And yet if you look at the legal structure, the UK, and increasingly around the globe, what you have is legislation that views it as a criminal act. So you have a perpetrator of a crime and you have a victim of crime. And in the globalised world we need to move it away from just being a debate about immigration and I think we need to move it back to being a debate about: here is a crime that's taken place.</p><p></p><p>We also found that data was a big issue, which, in trying to ask the question what is the size of the problem, we took the decision very early on that we would not be able to answer that question. So here's a first-world country, and the UK government would admit this as well, that we have no handle on the data. The only data we have are those that have chosen to access the government's care programme. But we know, as an organisation, that isn't the true figure; and whether you talk to law enforcement, statutory agencies, everybody will tell you that is not a true figure.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And obviously behind that data are the people who are affected by this globalised labour situation. Let's hear from someone now with direct experience of being trafficked into the UK. Last week, reporter Harriet Grant interviewed a young woman originally from China, who says she was a victim of forced labour by a criminal gang. Her name's been changed to protect her identity.</p><p></p><p><strong>HG</strong> In a cramped bedsit in a northern English town Min talks about the man who brought her here from China. She tells me that her family were being harassed by the police because they were followers of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong. So her grandmother put her into the hands of a man who said he could help her get to Britain, where he said the government would offer her protection and the chance of a new life.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side. He brought me to a house where I stayed for a long time. I was just locked inside the house. They told me that I could not escape and if I tried they would kill my grandmother in China, that it was dangerous for me to escape.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p></p><p>After taking a boat, then a train, still confused about where she was, their final destination was a cannabis factory in England where she was again held prisoner.</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"I had to tend to the plants, water, pick them and fertilise them. They said that if I didn't my grandmother would have to pay money and that if I escaped they would kill her. I was really scared.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>In 2008, the police discovered the factory and closed it down. Despite telling them what had happened to her, Min was charged with cannabis cultivation and sentenced to 12 months in prison. It was only after she finished the sentence that the UK Border Agency acknowledged she was reasonably likely to be a victim of trafficking. Last year they wrote to Min saying that because she escaped from that situation, she cannot now be described as a victim of trafficking, even though they do accept she was under the control of her trafficker when arrested. The letter tells her that as a foreign criminal, she's now subject to deportation for the public good.</p><p></p><p>Min has a life in England now. She's pregnant and frightened about being sent home where her trafficker might find her. There's a test case at the Court of Appeal in May that is going to look at four cases similar to Min's. When I spoke to Min's lawyer, Hani Zubeidi at Fadiga & Co, he told me that he hopes these cases will set a precedent which will allow Min to challenge her own conviction. Until then she waits, unable to sleep at night, fearful of being sent home, branded a foreign criminal.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> That was Harriet Grant reporting and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/apr/07/human-traffic-victims-drug-factories\" title=\"\">you can read the full Observer article at guardian.co.uk</a>. So, Andrew, what does Min's case tell us about the failure of international efforts to tackle trafficking?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> Unfortunately her case is atypical. Just going through her story, you've got issues of a misunderstanding around immigration; you have criminalisation of a victim; you have identification of that victim but then being told but you're still an immigrant therefore we're going to turf you out of the country. So not only do we not recognise the victim, but we then penalise that victim. And then that plays into other issues around what is the awareness within statutory agencies and front-line agencies of what is being presented in front of them. Is it a cannabis factory with a drug cultivator; or is it actually a victim of crime who is there against their will, who, under the threat of violence, coercion, fear of retribution to their family is held there and will work there? And then behind that you have, well, why are they in this country producing cannabis in the first place? Because society wants a demand for it. The UK is now net exporter of cannabis. So there's your pull factor into the UK. And where's our reintegration of survivors? That individual remains vulnerable. If returned to the situation where they've come from, in all likelihood will be retrafficked. And so there are so many issues at play that just basically shows you, to quote The Thick of It, an omnishambles of a response.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, do you have a response to that? Obviously, that goes back to a lot of what you were saying when you were defining forced labour for us at the beginning of the programme.</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> Yes, absolutely. You have all the elements here: the deception, restriction of the freedom of movements, where that's a clear case of trafficking. And what it really shows is the failure of identification systems. It should have been, from the beginning, this person should have received assistance, there should have been no doubts about her circumstances. And yet it just didn't happen. And it's very symptomatic, particularly for workers and sectors that are informal, so, obviously, cannabis production is an illegal activity in most countries, but also the sex industry is a very typical, not being protected as victims of forced labour. The same is true for other activities like forced begging or more formal activities, domestic work and even construction and so on.</p><p></p><p>So I think it's a clear problem here to properly identify potential victims and then provide them with the necessary care.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> OK. And we had a question from a listener that kind of ties into this. <a href=\"https://id.guardian.co.uk/profile/valentinacaron/public?returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk&authFailedReturnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">ValentinaCaron</a>, who worked for an NGO in Cambodia, this is what she wrote to us. She said: \"It's a shame that western donors rarely include activities like police training, I'm not saying that giving money for children's education is less important, but I feel that police training could really change the legal environment in which the Cambodian people live. Without an effective implementation of the international standards that bind Cambodia, it would never be possible to have this justice.\" She's offering some kind of solution. Romana, obviously Anti-Slavery International, a global organisation, have you seen these kind of issues that play around …</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> Absolutely. I think we would all agree that we need better training and awareness-raising amongst law enforcement. But immigration officers, particularly on many of the borders in the global south, but also immigration officers in Europe, but all criminal justice actors. So for the UK it would be about the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, clearly being able to access, not just the police being able to identify a potential victim of trafficking but it's also the criminal justice actors all the way through, right through to judges. And also being able to communicate that to juries in trafficking trials so that clearly victims' stories are well represented because they're very complex stories often.</p><p></p><p>If we look at a couple of cases that have been held here in the UK on domestic servitude, trafficking for domestic servitude, where you've got issues around witchcraft and how children have been, or adults have been controlled through issues around witchcraft, this really needs to be unpacked, so there has to be a real understanding by all actors that are working to what are the patterns of trafficking, what are the coercive methods that are used? And what are the areas of exploitation, because as we've heard, cannabis … who would have thought that people are being trafficked into cannabis a few years ago? So this is an emerging area where now we're finding people are being trafficked into criminal activities like forced begging, many Roma and Bulgarians on the streets of London and elsewhere that are being forced to beg. And this is a new area.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Do you think that part of the problem is, is that it has evolved, it has changed? So if you ask maybe the average person on the street here in the UK: what is slavery today? they may think of children in brick kilns in Pakistan; they may not think that it happens here in the UK or in other developed nations. And I just wonder whether there was that problem with the language that's being used, people not understanding the different types of modern day slavery that are going on; what's the difference between someone who's been trafficked, what's the difference between that and migration patterns? It's a very complex language being used.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> It is complex. And it's also going back to that image of expecting people in slavery to be in chains, and it's not at all like that now. And it's not just people being locked into factories. It's also people, you know, could be working in a bar or in restaurants, in construction, so forced labour situations are really around us all the time. It's just that we're not seeing it in that sort of framework, really.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Beate was mentioning earlier that she felt that there had been progress made by some national governments in acknowledging this problem; I was wondering in terms of the anti-slavery movement, the NGOs, the civil society groups who are working on this issue, do you believe that you're really making an impact in global efforts to end slavery?</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I think we are. Sometimes I think it's a drop in the ocean. But I think agree with Beate there has been a movement over the last few years to recognise the issue and the importance of the issue. Over the last 10 years the issue has become more and more at the top of the political agenda. Of course we're not there yet. I wouldn't want to pat anybody on the back, we need to do a lot more. In terms of civil society I think there are lots more … we've got business that are coming on board now as well, so I think it's about everybody being involved in this campaign, everybody being aware of what it is and being able to identify it and report it to the authorities when they see it.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And Andrew, you actually come from a corporate background, don't you? I was wondering what your views on this might be? Do you think that things need to change if we're really going to make strides forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> I'm going to be slightly controversial and I think what we've got better at is identifying it. Have we got better at eradicating it? I don't think we have. And I think it's an issue of systems process. So systems deliver processes and deliver results. And if you look across the globe and say, well, what are the results five years, 10 years, 100 years? The results are we have slaves. The results are: there are very few prosecutions. The results are: it's a high-return, low-risk industry to be involved in. And if you approach it as a commercial business, and back to what I was saying earlier about let's frame it as an illicit trade, and let's understand that the people that get involved in this and turn human beings into a commodity are doing it for business reasons, they're doing it to make money, they're doing it to get a return on their commodity. Then, are we winning? No, we're not. And I think there's a whole list of reasons why we're not. I think governments are glued to bureaucratic response and traffickers are, like, fair enough, carry on doing that, because we're fast, we're nimble, we're lean and mean and we can evolve.</p><p></p><p>So I actually think we need to be honest with ourselves, be it the NGO community, government community or the business community, and say are we actually tackling this and dismantling it? And I would say we're not. I think we can do it. I think the tools are there to enable us to do it, but is the will there, is the political will there, is the will there amongst NGOs to do it, is the will there within society to change practices that create the demand and the pulls for slavery to exist?</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> So, our appetite for cheap products as well, I imagine?</p><p></p><p><strong>AW</strong> For sure.</p><p></p><p><strong>RC</strong> I do hear what you're saying, Andrew, but I do also think that things have come a long way, honestly, in the last 10 years. We wouldn't have been having this conversation. It was really difficult to get any journalist or anybody to talk about slavery and forced labour. And just in the last 10 years, when you see the proliferation of NGOs just in the UK working on this issue. I mean for a very long time, Anti-Slavery International was one of the only organisations working, and the ILO of course, Beate of course, and so there's a lot more awareness. I mean, clearly, there's a lot more to do. Clearly, in terms of business needs to also take its responsibilities. We need a transparent supply chain which is audited and that audit needs to be transparent. And we need accountability. Governments, yes, we do need to make it more of a priority but I do think we are making steps, I don't want to be the doom and gloom merchant, there are solutions out there because I've seen communities change. Empowerment can happen quite quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> And, Beate, are you optimistic about the way forward?</p><p></p><p><strong>BA</strong> It's an area where change will only emerge very slowly, because it's linked to a change of attitudes and behaviours of different groups of people, be it government, business and the people concerned. I'd like to come back quickly on the economic interest, because Andrew is also right in saying that as long as we don't understand these economic drivers, we won't really move the agenda forward. And that's very true. I mean, that's one of the reasons why we have worked on the profit figures, we will produce a new figure this year, it's most likely to be much higher than the one you have quoted in the beginning. We need to understand the economic interest and we need to get business involved. And it's very much on the ILO's agenda.</p><p></p><p><strong>AK</strong> Fabulous. So, in conclusion, we need to really understand the money and who's profiting and understand it as a criminal business as well. Well, I'm afraid that's all we've got time for today.

It will move to the Senate and then to the president's desk. </p><p>The bill allows private businesses to share customers' personal information with any government entity, including the National Security Agency.</p><p>Reintroduced in February after failing to pass Congress last year, the bill would afford legal protection to the government and businesses to share data with each other on cyber threats.</p><p>Its co-author, Mike Rogers, the intelligence committee chairman and a Republican from Michigan, argues that cyberattacks and espionage, particularly from China, where a number of high profile attacks have originated recently, are a number one threat to US economic security.</p><p>\"We have a constitutional obligation to defend this nation,\" said Rogers, on the House floor. \"This is the answer to empower cyber information sharing to protect this nation, to allow those companies to protect themselves and move on to economic prosperity. If you want to take a shot across China's bow, this is the answer.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Rogers dismissed opponents of the bill as teenagers in their basements.</p><p>Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat of Maryland, the other co-author of the bill, said on Wednesday during debate on the issue that $400bn worth of American trade secrets are being stolen by US companies every year.</p><p>\"If your house is being robbed, you call 911 and the police department comes. That's the same scenario we are looking at here,\" he said.</p><p>At one point, Mike McCaul, a Republican from Texas, attempted to draw a comparison between the terror attack in Boston on Monday and cyberterrorism, to draw support for the bill's aim to improve security. \"Recent events in Boston demonstrate that we have to come together as Republicans and Democrats,\" he said, according to Reuters.</p><p>\"In the case of Boston, there were real bombs,\" said McCaul. \"In this case, they are digital bombs – and these digital bombs are on their way.\"</p><p>Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority leader, expressed the same concerns shared by the White House and civil liberty groups that the bill had failed to strike a \"crucial balance between security and liberty\".</p><p>\"Im disappointed that we did not address some of the concerns mentioned by the White House about personal information,\" Pelosi said. \"Unfortunately, it offers no policies and did not allow any amendments or real solution that upholds Americans' right to privacy.\"</p><p>Last year, global protests by a coalition of internet activists and web companies, including Google and Wikipedia and Twitter, scuppered a similar bill, the Hollywood-backed Stop Online Piracy Act.

It will move to the Senate and then to the president's desk. </p><p>The bill allows private businesses to share customers' personal information with any government entity, including the National Security Agency.</p><p>Reintroduced in February after failing to pass Congress last year, the bill would afford legal protection to the government and businesses to share data with each other on cyber threats.</p><p>Its co-author, Mike Rogers, the intelligence committee chairman and a Republican from Michigan, argues that cyberattacks and espionage, particularly from China, where a number of high profile attacks have originated recently, are a number one threat to US economic security.</p><p>\"We have a constitutional obligation to defend this nation,\" said Rogers, on the House floor. \"This is the answer to empower cyber information sharing to protect this nation, to allow those companies to protect themselves and move on to economic prosperity. If you want to take a shot across China's bow, this is the answer.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Rogers dismissed opponents of the bill as teenagers in their basements.</p><p>Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat of Maryland, the other co-author of the bill, said on Wednesday during debate on the issue that $400bn worth of American trade secrets are being stolen by US companies every year.</p><p>\"If your house is being robbed, you call 911 and the police department comes. That's the same scenario we are looking at here,\" he said.</p><p>At one point, Mike McCaul, a Republican from Texas, attempted to draw a comparison between the terror attack in Boston on Monday and cyberterrorism, to draw support for the bill's aim to improve security. \"Recent events in Boston demonstrate that we have to come together as Republicans and Democrats,\" he said, according to Reuters.</p><p>\"In the case of Boston, there were real bombs,\" said McCaul. \"In this case, they are digital bombs – and these digital bombs are on their way.\"</p><p>Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority leader, expressed the same concerns shared by the White House and civil liberty groups that the bill had failed to strike a \"crucial balance between security and liberty\".</p><p>\"Im disappointed that we did not address some of the concerns mentioned by the White House about personal information,\" Pelosi said. \"Unfortunately, it offers no policies and did not allow any amendments or real solution that upholds Americans' right to privacy.\"</p><p>Last year, global protests by a coalition of internet activists and web companies, including Google and Wikipedia and Twitter, scuppered a similar bill, the Hollywood-backed Stop Online Piracy Act. At the time they warned that future attempts to push through legislation that threatened digital freedoms would be met with a similar response.</p><p>Holmes Wilson, co-founder of online advocacy group Fight For the Future, said he and other critics would continue to lobby against Cispa. \"It would have been so easy to fix this bill and require sites to strip out personal information before passing them to the government.\" he said.</p><p>He said amendments had been made in closed sessions and it was \"not out of the question\" that privacy protections had been left out intentionally at the behest of the intelligence agencies.</p><p>House intelligence committee leaders addressed some privacy concerns by endorsing an amendment that gave the job of clearing house for the exchange data to the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, rather than a military agency.</p><p>The bill has attracted support from tech giants including IBM who are keen for liability protection from consumers whose information they have shared, said Wilson. \"Right now if the government wants users' information, the company can say no because it opens them up to being sued,\" he said. \"If Cispa passes, there will be no legal restraint.\"</p><p>Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which had unsuccessfully urged the House to adopt an amendment that would have allowed companies to make a privacy contract with their customers, said it was a \"poorly drafted\" bill that would present a \"gaping exception to bedrock privacy law\".</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union, one of 34 groups that wrote to lawmakers this week urging them to oppose the bill, said they would work with Congress to ensure the next version of information-sharing legislation resolves the privacy issue and protects personal information online.</p><p>\"CISPA is an extreme proposal that allows companies that hold our very sensitive information to share it with any company or government entity they choose, even directly with military agencies like the NSA, without first stripping out personally identifiable information,\"<a href=\"http://EndtheLie.com/2013/04/18/us-house-of-representatives-passes-cispa-cybersecurity-bill/#ixzz2QqpFJ7Fm\"> said Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel at the ACLU</a>'s Washington Legislative Office.</p><p><a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/pro-cispa-backers-spend-over-100-times-more-lobbying-opponents/\">A Sunlight Foundation report recently revealed</a> that interest groups in support of the bill spent $605m from 2011 to the third quarter of 2012 – 140 times as much lobbying Congress as those on the other side of the debate, who spent $4.3m.</p><p>The bill's opponents, which include digital rights organisations and Internet companies like Reddit and Craiglist, petitioned the White House and submitted more than 300,000 signatures to the House Intelligence Committee.

No, it's the legislative branch; cash money has wrecked Congress, and in doing that much, it has paralyzed American governance beyond all practical hope.</p><p>Only fools play a rigged game forever, and governments that elevate money and firearms over human life, that treat its people and their will with such indifference – such governments eventually lose not only honor, but credibility. People lose the reason to believe. Eventually, a deep and abiding apathy prevails. Either that, or someone picks up a brick.</p><p>• This article was first <a href=\"http://davidsimon.com/dead-children-and-monied-politicians/\">published on the author's site</a> and is crossposted by kind permission</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-financing\">US political financing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-simon\">David Simon</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It seems unfathomable that, despite the sheer volume of nonsense churned out, not once has LiS stopped its metaphorical tour bus outside the well-appointed Cheshire home of Nick&nbsp;Freeman.</p><p>In my defence, for a long time I&nbsp;didn't realise Nick was real, assuming he was just created by the Random Late Capitalist Character Generator, like \"Trudie Styler\" or the lady with the NHS boobs who organised a Thatcher death party. (If you're reading this, Romany Blythe, you're my best new sublebrity.)</p><p>But it seems that Nick actually exists. Beside a highly-coiffed photo, <a href=\"http://www.nickfreemansolicitors.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his website</a> trumpets his work for \"a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;high-profile celebrities\", who have included Alex Ferguson (the&nbsp;Manchester United manager had diarrhoea), Caprice (cystitis), Jeremy Clarkson (nothing wrong \"down there\", but they couldn't prove it was him driving), Jimmy Carr, a tanked-up Steve McFadden and endless footballers. He has trademarked the name \"Mr Loophole\".</p><p>Only this week, Nick defended Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding on charges of using a mobile phone at the wheel and&nbsp;failing to stop for an officer. He explained that \"the Range Rover bluetooth system works erratically\" –&nbsp;not a&nbsp;dry sickbag in the house for that&nbsp;one, I imagine – and presented an argument the judge later summarised as amounting to Harding not being a&nbsp;mere \"normal person\".</p><p>\"Won the battle, lost the war\", was Nick's self-lacerating tweet on the verdict, much as if he had mishandled the Tet offensive, as opposed to got only half the driving charges against a&nbsp;pop star dropped.</p><p>But then, a celebrity in motoring distress is like the bat signal to him. Do imagine Nick deep in his underground Manchester base, receiving word that someone's black Range-Rover – the vehicular calling card of the arseoisie – has been snapped doing 117mph while they are half-cut or on the phone to their agent or something equally post-justice. \"I needed to protect my reputation,\" he said of copyrighting Mr&nbsp;Loophole, \"and the public.\"</p><p>Mm. It's a tough call, but I think my favourite thing about Nick is how he cloaks his work in the mantle of some perverse moral code, rather like Max Clifford. Much of what Max does, you will recall, is for a higher purpose. His 90s Tory sleaze exposes were a self-styled \"personal vendetta\" against that government's NHS policies. Nick appears to share much of the Clifford burden (a Yewtree call-up obviously excepted). Which is to say, many people misunderstand him. Nick insists you see him as some kind of legal antihero, dedicated to exposing flaws in police evidence gathering. \"I'm highlighting the potholes,\" he says. \"I'm not the man with the tarmac.\"</p><p>Perhaps it would help to consider him in the mould of troubled crusaders like The Punisher. And in many ways, Nick's is the classic superhero narrative. Aged 12, I imagine, he saw his parents brutally assaulted by a parking ticket, and the gut-twisting horror of that injustice made him what he is today. Sometimes, he still wakes up screaming, the look on their faces as they shrieked, \"Why don't these council parasites get a proper job?\" as fresh as it was that fateful day all those years ago. Justice doesn't yet have a new face, but it's certainly got a load of expensive hair products.</p><p>If I do have a cavil, it's the use of the \"Mr\" honorific in his superhero name. Lost in Showbiz would have preferred it if he'd gone with the definite article instead. \"The Loophole\" is much better than \"Mr Loophole\". Mr&nbsp;Loophole, in&nbsp;fact, may well qualify for the title of Worst Superhero Ever – outstripping even uber-nebbishes like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRNL69z4KE\" title=\"\">Mintberry Crunch</a>.</p><p>Yet to concentrate on a single aspect of Nick's work is to misunderestimate this renaissance man. After all, he is a much underrated thinker, and until last year enjoyed a position as columnist for the Manchester Evening News.</p><p>\"I suspect there is a strong link between our ever growing obesity problem and litter,\" <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/patriotic-duty-to-keep-streets-looking-689570\" title=\"\">runs one Paul Krugman-esque outing</a>. \"I have yet to find an avocado and chicken sandwich container while out on a morning run or a salad niçoise for that matter.\"</p><p>But it is in the field of sexual politics that Nick is at his most surpassingly incisive. When he rings his energy provider twice, conflicting advice from a female call centre worker and a male one leads him to <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/nick-freeman-lets-hear-it-for-new-679915\" title=\"\">one conclusion</a>: \"Dare I suggest that women are frequently unreasonable when in positions of power and dealing with men?\"</p><p>On rape, he warns that women need to \"take responsibility\" for how they dress. \"As a red-blooded alpha male,\" <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/nick-freeman-take-responsibility-for-how-862980\" title=\"\">Nick explains</a>, \"let me state unequivocally that I believe how a woman dresses (and behaves in that dress) tells a man what's on her mind.\" That said, he informs readers that his defence work has brought him into contact with \"cases where those who have been dressed in a perfectly conventional way were still victims of this heinous crime.\" Key word: still. The way a woman dresses, Nick concludes, \"can victimise men\".</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it is to this kind of elastic mind that some celebrities on drink-driving or speeding raps seem instinctively drawn. And, happily, the medium of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMrLoophole\" title=\"\">Twitter now allows Nick to speak that mind whenever he pleases</a>.</p><p>\"The day women got equal rights was the day they lost all their rights,\" runs a slightly opaque recent tweet. In another, I'm A Celebrity contestant Helen Flanagan was deemed to be \"nice but very dim – setting the female cause back decades\". I am not sure if Nick does the full set of isms, and a black person behaving irksomely on some reality TV show or other would be joshingly branded as setting the civil-rights cause back decades. I imagine he'll be getting in touch, though, so perhaps he could let me know then.</p><p>In the meantime, you might be wondering why we can't send such a&nbsp;treasure on permanent loan abroad. It's a thought that seems to have occurred to Nick, who imagines himself a fit with what he imagines to&nbsp;be America. \"I would be a celebrity over there,\" he&nbsp;chuckled to an interviewer last year.&nbsp;\"It's a different mental ethos.

It seems unfathomable that, despite the sheer volume of nonsense churned out, not once has LiS stopped its metaphorical tour bus outside the well-appointed Cheshire home of Nick&nbsp;Freeman.</p><p>In my defence, for a long time I&nbsp;didn't realise Nick was real, assuming he was just created by the Random Late Capitalist Character Generator, like \"Trudie Styler\" or the lady with the NHS boobs who organised a Thatcher death party. (If you're reading this, Romany Blythe, you're my best new sublebrity.)</p><p>But it seems that Nick actually exists. Beside a highly-coiffed photo, <a href=\"http://www.nickfreemansolicitors.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his website</a> trumpets his work for \"a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;high-profile celebrities\", who have included Alex Ferguson (the&nbsp;Manchester United manager had diarrhoea), Caprice (cystitis), Jeremy Clarkson (nothing wrong \"down there\", but they couldn't prove it was him driving), Jimmy Carr, a tanked-up Steve McFadden and endless footballers. He has trademarked the name \"Mr Loophole\".</p><p>Only this week, Nick defended Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding on charges of using a mobile phone at the wheel and&nbsp;failing to stop for an officer. He explained that \"the Range Rover bluetooth system works erratically\" –&nbsp;not a&nbsp;dry sickbag in the house for that&nbsp;one, I imagine – and presented an argument the judge later summarised as amounting to Harding not being a&nbsp;mere \"normal person\".</p><p>\"Won the battle, lost the war\", was Nick's self-lacerating tweet on the verdict, much as if he had mishandled the Tet offensive, as opposed to got only half the driving charges against a&nbsp;pop star dropped.</p><p>But then, a celebrity in motoring distress is like the bat signal to him. Do imagine Nick deep in his underground Manchester base, receiving word that someone's black Range-Rover – the vehicular calling card of the arseoisie – has been snapped doing 117mph while they are half-cut or on the phone to their agent or something equally post-justice. \"I needed to protect my reputation,\" he said of copyrighting Mr&nbsp;Loophole, \"and the public.\"</p><p>Mm. It's a tough call, but I think my favourite thing about Nick is how he cloaks his work in the mantle of some perverse moral code, rather like Max Clifford. Much of what Max does, you will recall, is for a higher purpose. His 90s Tory sleaze exposes were a self-styled \"personal vendetta\" against that government's NHS policies. Nick appears to share much of the Clifford burden (a Yewtree call-up obviously excepted). Which is to say, many people misunderstand him. Nick insists you see him as some kind of legal antihero, dedicated to exposing flaws in police evidence gathering. \"I'm highlighting the potholes,\" he says. \"I'm not the man with the tarmac.\"</p><p>Perhaps it would help to consider him in the mould of troubled crusaders like The Punisher. And in many ways, Nick's is the classic superhero narrative. Aged 12, I imagine, he saw his parents brutally assaulted by a parking ticket, and the gut-twisting horror of that injustice made him what he is today. Sometimes, he still wakes up screaming, the look on their faces as they shrieked, \"Why don't these council parasites get a proper job?\" as fresh as it was that fateful day all those years ago. Justice doesn't yet have a new face, but it's certainly got a load of expensive hair products.</p><p>If I do have a cavil, it's the use of the \"Mr\" honorific in his superhero name. Lost in Showbiz would have preferred it if he'd gone with the definite article instead. \"The Loophole\" is much better than \"Mr Loophole\". Mr&nbsp;Loophole, in&nbsp;fact, may well qualify for the title of Worst Superhero Ever – outstripping even uber-nebbishes like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRNL69z4KE\" title=\"\">Mintberry Crunch</a>.</p><p>Yet to concentrate on a single aspect of Nick's work is to misunderestimate this renaissance man. After all, he is a much underrated thinker, and until last year enjoyed a position as columnist for the Manchester Evening News.</p><p>\"I suspect there is a strong link between our ever growing obesity problem and litter,\" <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/patriotic-duty-to-keep-streets-looking-689570\" title=\"\">runs one Paul Krugman-esque outing</a>. \"I have yet to find an avocado and chicken sandwich container while out on a morning run or a salad niçoise for that matter.\"</p><p>But it is in the field of sexual politics that Nick is at his most surpassingly incisive. When he rings his energy provider twice, conflicting advice from a female call centre worker and a male one leads him to <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/nick-freeman-lets-hear-it-for-new-679915\" title=\"\">one conclusion</a>: \"Dare I suggest that women are frequently unreasonable when in positions of power and dealing with men?\"</p><p>On rape, he warns that women need to \"take responsibility\" for how they dress. \"As a red-blooded alpha male,\" <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/nick-freeman-take-responsibility-for-how-862980\" title=\"\">Nick explains</a>, \"let me state unequivocally that I believe how a woman dresses (and behaves in that dress) tells a man what's on her mind.\" That said, he informs readers that his defence work has brought him into contact with \"cases where those who have been dressed in a perfectly conventional way were still victims of this heinous crime.\" Key word: still. The way a woman dresses, Nick concludes, \"can victimise men\".</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it is to this kind of elastic mind that some celebrities on drink-driving or speeding raps seem instinctively drawn. And, happily, the medium of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMrLoophole\" title=\"\">Twitter now allows Nick to speak that mind whenever he pleases</a>.</p><p>\"The day women got equal rights was the day they lost all their rights,\" runs a slightly opaque recent tweet. In another, I'm A Celebrity contestant Helen Flanagan was deemed to be \"nice but very dim – setting the female cause back decades\". I am not sure if Nick does the full set of isms, and a black person behaving irksomely on some reality TV show or other would be joshingly branded as setting the civil-rights cause back decades. I imagine he'll be getting in touch, though, so perhaps he could let me know then.</p><p>In the meantime, you might be wondering why we can't send such a&nbsp;treasure on permanent loan abroad. It's a thought that seems to have occurred to Nick, who imagines himself a fit with what he imagines to&nbsp;be America. \"I would be a celebrity over there,\" he&nbsp;chuckled to an interviewer last year.&nbsp;\"It's a different mental ethos. When you have a nice car in this country, people don't really like it. In America, they're like: 'Wow, how did you do that? Great, fantastic.'</p><p>\"But,\" speculates Nick in a line somehow redolent of Basil Fawlty's inquiry as to whether there are palm trees in California, \"I'm sure there are good lawyers in America.\"</p><p>Well, as Basil's guest replied: \"They say Burt Lancaster had one, but I don't believe them.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime\">Crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/solicitors\">Solicitors</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/celebrity\">Celebrity</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marinahyde\">Marina Hyde</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So why isn't Facebook taking more action?</p><p>Last week, Laura Bates, of the <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\">Everyday Sexism Project</a>, tweeted a message to FinnAir, asking the company if it knew its advertising appeared on a Facebook page endorsing violence against women. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Finnair/status/322719558983102464\">The company responded</a>: </p><blockquote><p>\"This is totally against our values and policies.\"</p></blockquote><p>Several <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a473289/facebook-advertisers-hit-out-over-offensive-groups.html\">other angry advertisers</a> felt the same way.</p><p>I doubt that most advertisers are aware of how regularly this situation occurs. For example, this morning, a Duracell battery ad is visible on a group page called \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/191719417522947/\">I kill bitches like you</a>;\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sexy-arab-Girls/202822343188589\">Sexy Arab Girls</a>, \"join our page for more porn videos,\" was sponsored by the Wilberforce Dinner \"Honoring Cardinal Timothy Dolan,\" and the now-removed page, \"Domestic Violence: Don't Make Me Tell You Twice,\" populated by photos of women beaten, bruised and bleeding, was the platform for Vistaprint.</p><p>\"We occasionally see people post distasteful or crude content. While it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies,\" a Facebook spokesperson explained, when I asked what Facebook's response to similar pages is. </p><blockquote><p>\"However, there is no place on Facebook for content that is hateful, threatening, or incites violence, and we will not tolerate material deemed to be genuinely or directly harmful.\"</p></blockquote><p>Facebook has <a href=\"http://bit.ly/XjACqY\">detailed procedures for handling complaints</a> and clearly states that user safety is a company priority. Given the astounding volume of people and content that Facebook deals with (<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57566550-93/facebook-by-the-numbers-1.06-billion-monthly-active-users/\">more than 1 billion users</a>), the company only acts when content is reported. The issue is, therefore, how words like \"hateful\" and \"genuinely\" \"harmful\" are defined, and, importantly, whether or not men and women understand \"safety\" differently.</p><p>Facebook moderators deal with real instances of violence and crime every day. \"Not real\" content depicting rape and the physical abuse of girls and women is often categorized by Facebook as [Humor] and readily viewed. Recent examples <a href=\"http://sorayachemaly.tumblr.com/post/47279756332/what-would-happen-facebook-stopped-allowing-images\">include a photograph</a> of a man carrying a limp girl with the caption, \"Rohyphnol: When Traditional Dating Methods Just Aren't Cutting it!\" and the page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Humor-I-LOVE-THE-R-A-P-E-VAN/379309068096\">\"I Love the Rape Van\"</a>. The company tries to address complaints within 72 hours, but pages like \"Raping Babies Because You're Fucking Fearless\" can remain up for more than a month.</p><p>To the founders of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StopRapebook\">Rapebook</a>, a page started last fall to \"tackle misogyny on Facebook by sharing and reporting pages\", content trivializing sexualized and domestic abuse is intrinsically hateful and harmful. Immediately, the page <a href=\"http://feministadminssupport.blogspot.com/\">became the target of massive trolling and administrators were threatened</a> with violent rape and death and bombarded with graphic images and porn. Posts, such as one urging people to give a donation to an anti-violence campaign at Amnesty International, generated more than 100 comments, including \"fuck that. hit that hoe (sic),\" and \"Domestic violence is a 2 way street you hypocritical cunt.\" This suggests hostility. Which might provoke anxiety. And create an environment that does not feel safe to the average woman. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3210143\">Studies show that content like this</a> is triggering and degrades the ability of consumers of the content to empathize with victims.</p><p>When I spoke to Facebook representatives, they responded quickly and were forthcoming about their policies. Guidelines are clear about harassment, bullying and hate speech – which is why this problem is not about constraining people's \"free speech\". It's about how mainstream <a href=\"http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/author/mary-anne-franks\">misogynistic norms are embedded</a>, not only in Facebook's interpretations of \"free speech\", \"safety\", \"humor\" and \"credible threats\", but in the very way their review process is structured. </p><p>First, what is notable about <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/cheats/2013/04/08/rapebook-targeted-on-facebook.html\">cases like Rapebook co-founder Trista Hendren</a>'s is the comfort and speed with which opponents resort to violent rape and death threats <a href=\"http://www.shakesville.com/2007/11/on-bitch-and-other-misogynist-language.html\">using misogynistic language</a>. Facebook's guidelines prohibit hate speech, even though hate speech is, in fact, protected in the US by the first amendment. Users comfortable with denigrating women manipulate a review process that does not recognize sex-based hate speech and is not set up to consider context. Specifically, Facebook has no reporting mechanism for considering how a hostile environment (treating rape and violence against women literally as a joke or ignoring content that is viscerally threatening) might affect its female users.</p><p>Second, what people like Hendren are protesting is <em>not</em> easily mocked hurt feelings, but systemically tolerated hate, degradation, objectification and marginalization of girls and women, behind which loiters <em>actual violence</em>. Women, <a href=\"http://www.vday.org/node/1040\">acculturated to a world</a> where one in three women will be sexually assaulted (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/50-facts-rape_b_2019338.html\">in the US</a>, that number is one in five; for men, one in 77), cannot separate this reality from their online experiences. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/50-actual-facts-about-dom_b_2193904.html\">Domestic violence statistics</a> reflect a similar epidemic. The vast majority of perpetrators in either case are men. This dynamic is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Offensive-Internet-Speech-Privacy-Reputation/dp/0674064313\">reflected in online misogyny</a>. </p><p>\"At first, people started posting pictures of women and young girls being raped or beat up and commenting on the page saying things like, \"I will skull-f**k your children,\" explains Hendren. \"Then the harassment moved offline after our personal information was posted all over Facebook. I was called and emailed repeatedly. Later my address and children's names were posted as well.\"</p><p>Despite the fact that Facebook representatives may have done their best to work closely with Rapebook, the administrators closed the page after months of receiving up to 500 messages a day, including photographs of actual rapes and child pornography. Hendren's photo was used to create rape memes. She has left Facebook. It's important to note that people who supported Rapebook's efforts were unwilling to publicly show their support in Facebook, for fear of similar targeting. </p><p>How is this not a loss of free speech for these users (overwhelmingly women), resulting from bullying, harassment and misogyny? The people left feeling comfortable at Facebook are rape apologists and those who create content glorifying the debasement of women. </p><p>A common retort to all of this is: \"This is the internet. It's offensive. If you don't like it, leave.\" That is correct: speech on the internet can be offensive and the right to be offensive is vital to democracy. But Facebook is <em>not</em> \"the internet\". Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/principles.php%20https://www.facebook.com/principles.php\">a company with principles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\">community standards</a> that create a reasonable expectation in users that it will enforce rules it itself has established in an unbiased manner. Facebook is perilously close to allowing \"freedom of speech\" to be used as a defense of unjust actions that are clearly intimidating and silencing female users.</p><p>If Facebook is already considering these issues, they aren't sharing that fact.

According to Bates, Facebook is resolute in not responding to the Everyday Sexism campaign. Advertisers are, however, and as the saying goes, money talks. But is it too much to hope for that Facebook's famously pro-woman chief operating officer might do something about Facebook's misogyny problem before she is simply forced to act because it's hurting the company's bottom line?</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/sheryl-sandberg\">Sheryl Sandberg</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women\">Women</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/domestic-violence\">Domestic violence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/freedom-of-speech\">Freedom of speech</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet\">Internet</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/social-media\">Social media</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality\">Equality</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/soraya-chemaly\">Soraya Chemaly</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So why isn't Facebook taking more action?</p><p>Last week, Laura Bates, of the <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\">Everyday Sexism Project</a>, tweeted a message to FinnAir, asking the company if it knew its advertising appeared on a Facebook page endorsing violence against women. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Finnair/status/322719558983102464\">The company responded</a>: </p><blockquote><p>\"This is totally against our values and policies.\"</p></blockquote><p>Several <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a473289/facebook-advertisers-hit-out-over-offensive-groups.html\">other angry advertisers</a> felt the same way.</p><p>I doubt that most advertisers are aware of how regularly this situation occurs. For example, this morning, a Duracell battery ad is visible on a group page called \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/191719417522947/\">I kill bitches like you</a>;\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sexy-arab-Girls/202822343188589\">Sexy Arab Girls</a>, \"join our page for more porn videos,\" was sponsored by the Wilberforce Dinner \"Honoring Cardinal Timothy Dolan,\" and the now-removed page, \"Domestic Violence: Don't Make Me Tell You Twice,\" populated by photos of women beaten, bruised and bleeding, was the platform for Vistaprint.</p><p>\"We occasionally see people post distasteful or crude content. While it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies,\" a Facebook spokesperson explained, when I asked what Facebook's response to similar pages is. </p><blockquote><p>\"However, there is no place on Facebook for content that is hateful, threatening, or incites violence, and we will not tolerate material deemed to be genuinely or directly harmful.\"</p></blockquote><p>Facebook has <a href=\"http://bit.ly/XjACqY\">detailed procedures for handling complaints</a> and clearly states that user safety is a company priority. Given the astounding volume of people and content that Facebook deals with (<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57566550-93/facebook-by-the-numbers-1.06-billion-monthly-active-users/\">more than 1 billion users</a>), the company only acts when content is reported. The issue is, therefore, how words like \"hateful\" and \"genuinely\" \"harmful\" are defined, and, importantly, whether or not men and women understand \"safety\" differently.</p><p>Facebook moderators deal with real instances of violence and crime every day. \"Not real\" content depicting rape and the physical abuse of girls and women is often categorized by Facebook as [Humor] and readily viewed. Recent examples <a href=\"http://sorayachemaly.tumblr.com/post/47279756332/what-would-happen-facebook-stopped-allowing-images\">include a photograph</a> of a man carrying a limp girl with the caption, \"Rohyphnol: When Traditional Dating Methods Just Aren't Cutting it!\" and the page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Humor-I-LOVE-THE-R-A-P-E-VAN/379309068096\">\"I Love the Rape Van\"</a>.

A <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/\">comprehensive report just issued</a> by a truly bipartisan group of former high-level Washington officials (including military officials) is as close as we are likely to get to such an official proclamation. </p><p>The Report <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/read/#/18/\">explains</a> that the impetus behind it was that \"the Obama administration declined, as a matter of policy, to undertake or commission an official study of what happened, saying it was unproductive to 'look backwards' rather than forward.\" It <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/read/#/18/\">concludes</a> - in unblinking and definitive fashion - that \"it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture\"; this finding is \"offered without reservation\"; it is \"not based on any impressionistic approach\" but rather \"grounded in a thorough and detailed examination of what constitutes torture in many contexts, notably historical and legal\"; and \"the nation's highest officials bear some responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of torture.\" It also debunks the popular claim that torture was confined to three cases of waterboarding, documenting that more than three people were subjected to that tactic and that the torture includes far more than just waterboarding.</p><p>This is not only a historical disgrace for the US and the responsible officials, but, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/us-practiced-torture-after-9-11-nonpartisan-review-concludes.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times article</a> on this report inadvertently suggests, also shames two other institutions:</p><blockquote><p>(1) the New York Times itself, which <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/07/03/keller_2/\">steadfastly refused</a> to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/30/media_258/\">use the word \"torture\"</a> to describe what was being done (<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/journalism_11/\">unless it was done</a> by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/07/04/torture_29/\">other countries</a>) and continues to justify that refusal <a href=\"http://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/the-t-words/?ref=opinion\">through its then-Executive Editor Bill Keller</a> (Andrew Sullivan <a href=\"http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/04/17/bill-keller-still-flailing/\">ably demolishes Keller's reasoning</a>, while the paper's public editor, Margaret Sullivan, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/targeted-killing-detainee-and-torture-why-language-choice-matters/\">wrote this week</a> that this choice merits \"some institutional soul-searching\"); and, </p><p>(2) President Obama, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">barred all criminal prosecutions for Bush officials and other torturers</a> and thus brazenly violated <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/02/16/treaties/\">at least the spirit and probably the letter</a> of <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html\">the Convention Against Torture</a>. That treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1988 (exactly 25 years ago to the day: Happy Anniversary!), <em>compels</em> all signatories who discover credible allegations that government officials have participated or been complicit in torture to \"submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution\" (Art. 7(1)). It also specifically states that \"no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture\" and \"an order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be invoked as a justification of torture\" (Art. 2 (2-3)). </p></blockquote><p>The disgrace of the American torture regime falls on Bush officials and secondarily the media and political institutions that acquiesced to it, but the full-scale protection of those war crimes (and the denial of justice to their victims) falls squarely on the Obama administration.</p><p>Dan Froomkin has more on the significance of this report <a href=\"http://froomkin.tumblr.com/post/48146234808/new-torture-reports-blames-obama-and-the-media-for-not\">here</a>.

That objection was voiced despite the multiple examples I cited where precisely that was done by the most mainstream news sources. It was voiced despite the grotesque media attempt to convert a Saudi <em>victim</em> of the bombing into \"the suspect\", as <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/04/the-saudi-marathon-man.html\">brilliantly analyzed by the New Yorker's Amy Davidson</a>. And now we have yet another example: probably the worst of the bunch.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, CNN humiliated itself as badly as it ever has (which is <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/dewey-defeats-truman-live-cnn-gets-it-wrong-on-the-health-care-ruling/259107/\">saying quite a bit</a>). The network's anchor John King, and its \"terrorism expert\", former Bush homeland security adviser Fran Townsend, both \"reported\" - as part of a \"Breaking News\" scoop that CNN loudly and excitedly trumpeted - that an arrest had been made in the Boston case and that the person was, as King put it, \"a dark-skinned individual\" (more or less simultaneously, Fox also reported the arrest). An hour later, it became clear that this was totally false. Raw Story details what happened <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/04/17/cnn-bungles-report-of-dark-skinned-male-arrested-in-boston-bombing-case/\">here</a>, and BuzzFeed (which one might at this point reasonably say is a level or so above CNN in the news reliability department) has the very amusing and appropriate mockery <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/dorsey/cnns-jaw-droppingly-awful-hour-of-boston-bombing-coverage\">here</a>.</p><p>But the best commentary on this debacle came from Chris Hayes' top-of-the-show seven-minute scathing monologue on MSNBC last night, where he not only crystallized why this was so journalistically reckless but, more importantly, explains exactly why CNN repeatedly said that the arrested person was \"dark-skinned\":</p><p>Townsend has built up quite a history at this point. It was she who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53434-2004Jun18.html\">visited Abu Ghraib in 2003</a> and put pressure on the prison officials there to extract more information. She then served as <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/12/washingtons_high_powered_terrorist_supporters/\">one of the paid shills</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/01/03/fran_townsend_terrorism/\">then-designated terrorist group Mujaheddin-e Khalq (MeK)</a>, even as she used her perch at CNN to cheer for broad interpretations of the \"material support for terrorism\" statute that sent American Muslims to prison for decades for far less involvement with such groups than she had with the MeK. And now she's at the center of this reporting disaster. Good job, CNN: nobody could have guessed that a Bush terrorism official would produce outcomes like this.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/136389836/Strategic-Options-for-Iran-Balancing-Pressure-with-Diplomacy#fullscreen\">different report</a> from a bipartisan cast of official Washington was issued today, this one on the Obama administration's Iran policy. Although it affirms the DC convention that Iran is some sort of serious threat to the US - a prerequisite for being viewed as Serious among its target audience - it surprisingly, and quite cogently, calls into serious question the wisdom of the sanctions regime imposed by the US. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/world/middleeast/report-on-iran-urges-obama-to-rethink-sanctions.html?smid=tw-share\">this good New York Times summary of the report</a> notes, the report explains that sanctions have \"contributed to an increase in repression and corruption within Iran\" and \"may be sowing the seeds of long-term alienation between the Iranian people and the United States\". </p><p>The most important conclusion is that Obama must rely far less on bluster, threats and sanctions - none of which is likely to achieve anything - and instead do far more to engage the Iranians and find a negotiated settlement to the multiple issues between the two countries. That is the same conclusion publicly advocated by Obama's own former Iran adviser Vali Nasr, who has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/us/politics/vali-nasr-criticizes-obama-in-the-dispensable-nation.html?pagewanted=all\">harshly criticized the president</a> for failing to engage in real diplomacy with Tehran, as well as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/09/iran\">former national security officials Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett</a>. That these same warnings now issue from such an establishment group as the one that produced this report is a compelling sign of just how misguided Obama policy has been. That does not, of course, mean, that he can or will change it. That's because, as Foreign Policy Community maven Les Gelb <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/07/leslie-h-gelb-on-obama-s-dangerous-nuclear-dance.html\">recently explained in the Daily Beast</a>, what drives Iran policy more than anything else is this:</p><blockquote><p>\"Administration officials would never admit it, but the main reason for their being tougher on Iran than North Korea seems tied to American domestic politics as much as or more than anything else, specifically the standing of Israel and oil versus Korea and Japan. On strictly foreign-policy and national-security grounds, Democratic and Republican officials surely regard Seoul and Tokyo as important as the Mideast, certainly now with the growing importance of Asia. In American politics, however, Israel and oil count for much, much more. It's notable that President Obama made his strongest pronouncements about employing force to stop Iranian nukes at the annual meeting of AIPAC, the very potent group of American-Jewish backers of Israel.\"</p></blockquote><p>Still, the more light shined on the fact that US belligerence toward Iran helps only Israel and hurts the US, the better.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> Also related to Monday's column on the Boston bombing: <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/it-terrorism-anatomy-very-murky-word#overlay-context=article/country-icon-sends-prayer-tweet-after-texas-blast\">the Associated Press apparently woke up this morning</a> and realized that the term \"terrorism\" has no real, fixed, or consistently applied meaning. This has long been clear, but it's nice to see this truth recognized in such a mainstream outlet:</p><blockquote><p>\"In times of tension and uncertainty, words can become malleable vessels - for cultural fears, for political agendas, for ways to make sense of the momentous and the unknown. In 2013 America, the word 'terrorism' exists at this ambiguous crossroads. And the opinions you'll find about it - this week in particular - often transcend mere linguistics.\"</p></blockquote><p>Precisely. But what's most amazing about it is that the term, though essentially impoverished of fixed meaning, is incomparably significant when it comes to legal, political and cultural assumptions. It's a word that means nothing, yet justifies everything those in power do.</p><p><strong>(5)</strong> The issue of the composition of the Guardian's readership often is raised in the comment section here and elsewhere.

A <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/\">comprehensive report just issued</a> by a truly bipartisan group of former high-level Washington officials (including military officials) is as close as we are likely to get to such an official proclamation. </p><p>The Report <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/read/#/18/\">explains</a> that the impetus behind it was that \"the Obama administration declined, as a matter of policy, to undertake or commission an official study of what happened, saying it was unproductive to 'look backwards' rather than forward.\" It <a href=\"http://detaineetaskforce.org/read/#/18/\">concludes</a> - in unblinking and definitive fashion - that \"it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture\"; this finding is \"offered without reservation\"; it is \"not based on any impressionistic approach\" but rather \"grounded in a thorough and detailed examination of what constitutes torture in many contexts, notably historical and legal\"; and \"the nation's highest officials bear some responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of torture.\" It also debunks the popular claim that torture was confined to three cases of waterboarding, documenting that more than three people were subjected to that tactic and that the torture includes far more than just waterboarding.</p><p>This is not only a historical disgrace for the US and the responsible officials, but, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/world/us-practiced-torture-after-9-11-nonpartisan-review-concludes.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times article</a> on this report inadvertently suggests, also shames two other institutions:</p><blockquote><p>(1) the New York Times itself, which <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/07/03/keller_2/\">steadfastly refused</a> to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/30/media_258/\">use the word \"torture\"</a> to describe what was being done (<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/journalism_11/\">unless it was done</a> by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/07/04/torture_29/\">other countries</a>) and continues to justify that refusal <a href=\"http://keller.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/the-t-words/?ref=opinion\">through its then-Executive Editor Bill Keller</a> (Andrew Sullivan <a href=\"http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/04/17/bill-keller-still-flailing/\">ably demolishes Keller's reasoning</a>, while the paper's public editor, Margaret Sullivan, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/targeted-killing-detainee-and-torture-why-language-choice-matters/\">wrote this week</a> that this choice merits \"some institutional soul-searching\"); and, </p><p>(2) President Obama, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/obama-justice-department-immunity-bush-cia-torturer\">barred all criminal prosecutions for Bush officials and other torturers</a> and thus brazenly violated <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/02/16/treaties/\">at least the spirit and probably the letter</a> of <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html\">the Convention Against Torture</a>.

Kade Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts commemorated the occasion with a truly perfect visual, particularly compelling in light of this week's new report decreeing it \"indisputable\" that the US government maintained a systematic torture regime:</p><p>That would make an excellent exhibit in the Obama presidential library, marking one of the most significant aspects of his legacy.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/torture\">Torture</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/glenn-greenwald\">Glenn Greenwald</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When Nash instinctively braked, the back of his lorry swerved into the gritter's path. There was a collision.

His lawyers argued that Hughes had, in fact, committed a crime before he died. Contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, he had inflicted grievous bodily harm (GBH) on Jones. That was a crime of violence which came within the compensation scheme.</p><p>The tribunal disagreed. It was not satisfied that Hughes intended to harm anybody. It was not even satisfied that he was reckless as to whether any level of harm would be caused by his actions. He simply didn't foresee that killing himself might cause physical harm to others. So there was no offence of GBH.</p><p>Jones challenged the tribunal's decision before the upper tribunal. That challenge also failed. The upper tribunal ruled that there was nothing irrational about the finding by the first-tier tribunal that Hughes was not reckless.</p><p>Then things started to go wrong. Jones's lawyers took the case to the court of appeal, where Lord Justice Patten seemed to think that the issue in the case was whether GBH was a crime of violence. He seemed to think that the first-tier tribunal had found against Jones for that reason.</p><p>It had not. Everyone agreed that GBH was a crime of violence. The only question was whether a person who was so deeply disturbed as to run in front of a lorry would have foreseen the harm that might be caused to others.

This week, it <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2011_0123_Judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">overruled the court of appeal</a>. Explaining the supreme court's decision, Lord Hope said there were \"signs that the court of appeal [had] allowed itself to be unduly influenced by its own view that it was highly improbable that anyone who runs into the path of traffic on a busy motorway will not at the least foresee the possibility of an accident and of consequential harm being caused to other road users\".</p><p>But, Hope continued, \"the question whether Mr Hughes did actually foresee this possibility was for the first-tier tribunal to answer, not the court of appeal\".</p><p>Expressing \"every sympathy\" for Jones and his family, Hope made it clear that the CICA and the tribunals had been right all along: the terms of the scheme did not permit an award of compensation in this case.</p><p>Jones was represented by Linda Levison from the law firm Pattinson & Brewer. She said: \"The decision has the effect in our client's case of putting the burden of proof on him to prove what was in the mind of the person committing suicide just before he died. As Mr Hughes is obviously dead and cannot be questioned, I think this is very harsh.\"</p><p>Ben Collins of Old Square Chambers, who represented the CICA throughout, said there might be cases of GBH that were non-violent, such as reckless health and safety failures.</p><p>He also pointed out that a new compensation scheme was introduced in November for claims lodged since then.

First, that a lowly tribunal can be right and the court of appeal can be wrong. Secondly, appeal courts should not try to substitute their own view of a case for that taken by the court that heard the evidence.

And, fourthly, that those contemplating suicide may not realise the effects of their actions on others.</p><p>We are not told what difference an award of compensation would have made to Jones.

She is due to launch a UK supreme court appeal against her latest rebuff.</p><p>But she said the Strasbourg court had \"moved the goalposts\" on the criteria needed to send the cleric to Jordan, and that the Home Office now needed to comply with this threshold. She rejected suggestions that she ignore these criteria and reapply for his deportation in the UK courts on the old basis.</p><p>\"It would then [if the government ignored the new test] be open to Abu Qatada to apply to the Strasbourg court, and I would be pretty certain that the Strasbourg court would apply their own test, they have established this as their own test, and they would abide by it,\" she told the home affairs select committee.</p><p>Lord Reid, the former Labour home secretary, agreed that the Strasbourg court had moved the goalposts by widening the grounds for appeal against deportation.</p><p>But he also accused May of acting prematurely by claiming in a celebratory fashion last year that he would be on the next plane to Jordan.</p><p>He accepted the public were very frustrated at the slowness of the deportation, saying \"the law is not seen as just by many, many people and that is the grave danger in the long run\".

Halappanavar died after being denied an emergency termination in October and her case has since been at the centre of Ireland's abortion wars. The inquest jury strongly endorsed the nine recommendations of the coroner, Ciaran MacLoughlin, including a suggestion that the Irish Medical Council lay out exactly when a doctor can intervene to save the life of a mother in similar circumstances.</p><p>The significance of this will only be known when the medical council delivers its guidelines. Abortion in Ireland is permitted where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother. If the medical council agrees that termination is permitted whenever a foetal membrane ruptures, then there is an implication that a small risk to the life of the mother trumps the right to life of the foetus. Not all women with ruptured membranes develop sepsis, and, to the best of my understanding, most sepsis is treatable through antibiotics. It would, therefore, be difficult to categorise ruptured membranes as a substantial risk to life.</p><p>If the medical council agrees that termination is permitted where the foetus is unviable, then this may open the door to termination for fatal foetal abnormality, currently illegal in the Republic. But all this is simply speculation – the medical council is a conservative beast: it could equally provide guidelines that support the actions of Halappanavar's medical team, who moved to terminate only when her sepsis was genuinely life-threatening.</p><p>Halappanavar's death made people who usually ignore the fact that Ireland is a little dot of backwardness in a sea of progressive reproductive values sit up and take note. She did not die for want of a termination in a developing country, but in 21st-century western Europe. Increasingly cosmopolitan, and, in spite of the crash, no longer the EU's poor and pitiable ward, it's easy to forget that Ireland is a very conservative country compared with its European counterparts. As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/15/abortion-ireland-opus-dei-catholic\" title=\"\">have argued before</a>, the separation of church and state in Ireland is an incomplete project at best.</p><p>At the inquest, Halappanavar's consultant, Dr Katherine Astbury, said that she met her patient's request for an abortion with the explanation that a poor foetal prognosis does not provide legal grounds for termination in the Republic. It must seem incomprehensible to people outside Ireland that when Halappanavar asked for a termination knowing that her pregnancy could not survive she was denied one because of the presence of a foetal heartbeat. In Ireland, however, women told that they are carrying live foetuses with fatal abnormalities routinely go to the UK to abort rather than wait weeks for their pregnancy to die, all the while growing bigger and trying to answer cheerful questions about the new baby without breaking into tears.</p><p>What's important to note here is that Halappanavar – a foreign national and a medical professional – felt it within her right to ask for a termination. Would an Irishwoman, brought up in a culture in which abortion is a dirty word and a shameful deed – and especially a less educated or differently educated Irishwoman – even have asked? Sometimes it takes an outside element to show how utterly messed up the system is.</p><p>One of the reasons that Halappanavar's death became an international news story was her husband Praveen's insistence that hospital staff told his wife that she couldn't have a termination because Ireland is a Catholic country. During the inquest, the midwife Ann Maria Burke came forward to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ann-maria-burke-says-remark-was-intended-to-be-broad-and-explanatory-1.1356387\" title=\"\">apologetically explain that she was the source of this remark</a>. She said that she had only wanted to throw light on Irish culture for Halappanavar, explaining: \"It was the law of the land and there were two referendums where the Catholic church was pressing the buttons.\" From reportage, it looks as though she was all but slapped on the wrist by the coroner, who told her that Irish public hospitals do not follow any religious tenet or dogma.</p><p>Burke deserves praise, not sanction, for telling Halappanavar the truth as to why she couldn't have a termination. Where Astbury defends her medical practice through reference to law, and MacLoughlin places Irish hospitals above religious dogma, Burke alone acknowledges the logic behind the legality. The only possible logic for denying Halappanavar the treatment she would have received in other developed countries is Catholic logic.</p><p>The evidence given at the inquest shows unequivocally that Halappanavar would have received different treatment in a different jurisdiction. Astbury admitted as much, and expert witness Dr Peter Boylan has said Halappanavar would most likely be alive if she'd been given a termination, as she requested, within two days of admission to hospital.</p><p>The inquest into Halappanavar's death has delivered its verdict on what would have been her fifth wedding anniversary. I inject this element of humanity into my article not to tug on heartstrings for a pro-choice cause, but to remind us that, for all that Halappanavar's death has come to symbolise in Ireland, hers is a human story and a human tragedy. Praveen Halappanavar <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/husband-objects-to-inquiry-members-1.554117\" title=\"\">has said</a>: \"The law has to change.

Not enough to know my name or anything, but at least it isn't the terrifying blankness of the last time I visited.</p><p>But that brief flicker at the beginning of the visit is all I get. After that, Dad seems not to know me at all. Worse, he appears to actively dislike me.</p><p>All he wants to do is pace up and down the corridor, stroking the walls. His carers leave me to it and I follow him around – from the living room down, and then back up again.</p><p>I entreat him to sit down by taking his elbow, promising a cup of tea and a&nbsp;biscuit, but Dad shakes me off angrily. \"Gettoff!\" he says, threateningly, before turning his back to me and resuming his Forrest Gump routine. I&nbsp;feel a bit like an idiot trailing around&nbsp;after him. In my smart coat, blowdried hair and fixed smile, what am I doing?</p><p>As if he is aware of how redundant I&nbsp;am, Dad frowns angrily every time he&nbsp;catches sight of me. Indeed, he is more aggressive than I've seen him since he got ill. At one point, he even makes to push me in the face. It is not&nbsp;hard to sidestep his trembling hand, there is no real threat, but still it is unsettling.</p><p>\"You all right?\" asks a member of staff flatly. She is sitting and helping another old man to eat a pastry.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I reply, with a nervous laugh, blushing as if I have committed a terrible faux pas. My demented father appears to hate me, and my reaction is to feel socially embarrassed. \"You monkeynuts!\" Dad growls, before  turning away again. That was an expression he would use to tease us affectionately, but this time it's an insult. He wanders off to try a locked door. He is pushing at it, looking through a glass pane, when one of the&nbsp;nurses, Sue, arrives.</p><p>Sue is one of those people you don't meet very often in life. She radiates goodness through every pore. It has taken me a while to differentiate between the staff, to learn their names, but now I always hope to get Sue on the phone if I call. She makes you feel as if everything is going to be OK, in abundant contradiction to the evidence. \"Your dad is a bit agitated isn't he?\" she says.</p><p>\"You might say that,\" I say. \"Has he been like this for long?\"</p><p>\"Well, we have had&nbsp;to change his&nbsp;medication since just before Easter,\" says Sue. \"They've stopped making his usual dosage of the mood stabiliser he takes, so he hasn't had it.\"</p><p></p><p>'That explains a lot,\" I say, looking at Dad's retreating form. \"We're sorting it out,\" says Sue. She smiles, her kind eyes full of light. \"So just come and find me if you've got any other questions.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I say. As she hurries off, I&nbsp;can't help but feel abandoned. There is nothing else to do but return to my father, temporarily joining him on his journey nowhere.</p><p></p><p>• <em>Follow Rebecca on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/dementia\">Dementia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mental-health\">Mental health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/power-of-attorney\">Power of attorney</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/family-finances\">Family finances</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/family-law\">Family law</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rebecca-ley\">Rebecca Ley</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
