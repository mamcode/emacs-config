A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems. Death often follows such a collapse.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That's why it was so easy for people to jump on to reports that a Saudi national had been a person of interest.  There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil.

Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news. Reporting the supreme court verdict on Obama's healthcare reforms, it wrongly reported that the individual mandate part of the legislation had been struck down. The mistake was later blamed on a producer who had jumped the gun.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/boston-globe\">Boston Globe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/cnn\">CNN</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/associated-press\">Associated Press</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said.

The global grounding came as just 50 of the planes had been delivered and was the longest of a commercial model in the jet age.</p><p>The company has been working on a solution with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). FAA administrator Michael Huerta said: \"A team of FAA certification specialists observed rigorous tests we required Boeing to perform and devoted weeks to reviewing detailed analysis of the design changes to reach this decision.\" </p><p>\"The FAA set a high bar for our team and our solution,\" said Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Jim McNerney. \"We appreciate the diligence, expertise and professionalism of the FAA's technical team and the leadership of FAA administrator Michael Huerta and secretary of transportation Ray LaHood throughout this process. Our shared commitment with global regulators and our customers to safe, efficient and reliable airplanes has helped make air travel the safest form of transportation in the world today.\"</p><p>The FAA will publish regulations on how to alter the batteries in the US Federal Register next week, allowing Boeing and airlines to proceed with the fixes. The company is believed to have come up with a solution that involves greater separation between the batteries' cells and a venting system for any potentially flammable gases.</p><p>Top US safety inspector the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) and Japanese authorities are still investigating the original causes of the two incidents, one in a plane parked at Boston's Logan airport and the other during flight in Japan.</p><p>The plane's grounding marked the first time since 1979 that FAA had banned every plane of a particular type from flying. That ban, on the Douglas DC-10, followed a fatal crash and was lifted within a month.</p><p>The 787's problems have been compounded by its hi-tech design. The Dreamliner is the largest passenger plane to make such extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. The batteries, however, have also proved volatile and caused fires in smaller planes, cars, computers and mobile devices.</p><p>Next week the NTSB will hold the second set of hearings this month on lithium-ion batteries and the fire that broke out on the 787 at Logan.

The global grounding came as just 50 of the planes had been delivered and was the longest of a commercial model in the jet age.</p><p>The company has been working on a solution with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). FAA administrator Michael Huerta said: \"A team of FAA certification specialists observed rigorous tests we required Boeing to perform and devoted weeks to reviewing detailed analysis of the design changes to reach this decision.\" </p><p>\"The FAA set a high bar for our team and our solution,\" said Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Jim McNerney. \"We appreciate the diligence, expertise and professionalism of the FAA's technical team and the leadership of FAA administrator Michael Huerta and secretary of transportation Ray LaHood throughout this process. Our shared commitment with global regulators and our customers to safe, efficient and reliable airplanes has helped make air travel the safest form of transportation in the world today.\"</p><p>The FAA will publish regulations on how to alter the batteries in the US Federal Register next week, allowing Boeing and airlines to proceed with the fixes. The company is believed to have come up with a solution that involves greater separation between the batteries' cells and a venting system for any potentially flammable gases.</p><p>Top US safety inspector the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) and Japanese authorities are still investigating the original causes of the two incidents, one in a plane parked at Boston's Logan airport and the other during flight in Japan.</p><p>The plane's grounding marked the first time since 1979 that FAA had banned every plane of a particular type from flying. That ban, on the Douglas DC-10, followed a fatal crash and was lifted within a month.</p><p>The 787's problems have been compounded by its hi-tech design. The Dreamliner is the largest passenger plane to make such extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. The batteries, however, have also proved volatile and caused fires in smaller planes, cars, computers and mobile devices.</p><p>Next week the NTSB will hold the second set of hearings this month on lithium-ion batteries and the fire that broke out on the 787 at Logan. The NTSB chairman, Deborah Hersman, has been critical of the \"assumptions\" regulators used before clearing  the ground-breaking use of the battery. The NTSB has also criticised Boeing for making statements \"inconsistent with our expectations.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/boeing\">Boeing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry\">Airline industry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/air-transport\">Air transport</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe\">Dominic Rushe</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The men had been identified earlier on Thursday as the main suspects in the bombing that left three dead and more than 170 injured.</p><p>In what law enforcement officials described as an ambush-style attack, Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times at about 10.30pm as he sat in his police cruiser within the MIT campus.</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after an ensuing car chase that ended with a shootout in the suburb of Watertown, but his younger brother managed to break through the line of officers and escape. An officer with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was wounded.</p><p>Hundreds of officers are now amassed in Watertown, supported by bomb squad robotic equipment and armored vehicles, giving the quiet town the appearance of a war zone. Across the greater Boston area almost a million people remain confined to their homes, mass transit systems are suspended and a no-fly zone has been imposed as the hunt for the fugitive continued. Boston Bruins and Red Sox games scheduled for Friday night have been cancelled.</p><p>Swat teams, carrying military-style rifles and protective shields, are proceeding house to house in Watertown. State police said that a controlled explosion would take place on Friday afternoon at an address on Norfolk Street, which was surrounded by police snipers earlier in the day.</p><p>National Guard helicopters have also landed at the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. The campus was evacuated on Friday.</p><p>The brothers were said by officials to have Chechen heritage. The family moved to Cambridge in 2003 from Kyrgyzstan, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev was born, according to an uncle. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was born in Dagestan.</p><p>The apparent Chechen connection prompted immediate speculation that the bomb attack was motivated by the Islamist separatist movement there, but no link has been established so far.</p><p>NBC and the New York Times reported that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had travelled to from New York to Moscow in January 2012, returning to the US in July.</p><p>Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, speaking to the Associated Press from the Russian city of Makhachkala, described his younger son as \"a true angel\", who was studying medicine. \"He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here,\" the father said.</p><p>But their uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, who lives in Montgomery Village, Maryland, described the brothers as \"losers\" who had brought shame on all Chechens. Speaking on live television outside him home, he urged his nephew: \"Dzhokhar, if you are alive, turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness.\" </p><p>Maret Tsarnaeva, an aunt of the brothers, said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev seemed not yet to have found \"himself yet in America, and recently went from being a devout Muslim who prays no more than once per day to one who prayed five times a day.</p><p>He had married and had a three-year-old daughter in the US, she told reporters in Toronto.</p><p>\"He has a wife in Boston from a Christian family, so you can't tie it to religion,\" she said. \"At that age all they want is love, so he found his love, he married, he had a daughter, and he was very happy about his daughter.\"</p><p>She described the boys as \"normal young men\" who are \"athletic\" and \"smart.\" Their father, she said, doted on the boys. \"Anzor is a very loving and soft-hearted father.\"</p><p>Dzokhar appears to have been a good student, having received a $2,500 scholarship from the city of Cambridge in 2011 to pursue college. He was also named a wrestling all-star at his high school the same year.</p><p>According to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's own account on the Russian social networking site VKontakte, he attended School No 1 in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, from 1999 to 2001, graduating from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a Massachusetts high school, two years ago.</p><p>On his VKontakte page, Tsarnaev says he considers \"career and money\" most important in life. As his worldview, he wrote: \"Islam\".</p><p>The page says Tsarnaev speaks English, Russian and Chechen, and belongs to a number of groups devoted to Chechnya. Dagestan, a republic neighbouring Chechnya, maintains a small Chechen minority.</p><p>A local TV station in Maryland interviewed another uncle, Alvi Tsarni. He told the reporter that he had heard about his nephews' involvement this morning from a sister-in-law. \"She was crying and she said that Tamerlan was killed.</p><p>\"I can't believe this, it's not possible. My nephews can't do this,\" Tsarni said. \"I don't believe any of my nephews [are] involved in this horrible incident.\"</p><p>In imperfect English, Tsarni, who said he had lived in the United States for 10 years, said he had not spoken with the brothers for a long time because of \"problems family.\" Then \"yesterday he called me,\" Tsarni said – he appeared to be referring to Tamerlan – \"and said 'Forgive me, and we will talk to this now. From now we will be together ever.\"</p><p>The uncle said that if his nephews were confirmed as the marathon bombers he would personally kneel in front of the families of the victims of the blasts and beg forgiveness.</p><p>The dramatic events began around 10.20pm on Thursday night with the armed robbery at the 7-Eleven store in Cambridge Central Square. About 10 minutes later, the men killed the MIT police officer Sean Collier, then hijacked a black Mercedes SUV, holding the driver captive at gunpoint for the next 30 minutes before they released him uninjured.</p><p>The car then sped in the direction of Watertown, prompting a huge police chase with local, state and federal law enforcers in pursuit. Towards the end of the chase, the suspects threw explosive devices out of the car. One bomb, described by eyewitnesses as resembling a pressure cooker, exploded in mid-air, causing a fireball and injuring many police officers.</p><p>Seconds later, Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran towards police, where he was either tackled or shot, lying prone on the ground before he was taken captive and rushed to hospital, where he died at about 1.35am. His younger brother escaped, driving a car straight through the police line, heading west. The car was abandoned a little further down the street, and the younger Tsarnaev made off on foot.</p><p>\"There is a massive manhunt under way, [and] a lot of law enforcement involved in that,\" Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick told reporters on Friday morning. \"We've got every asset that we can possibly muster on the ground right now.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder\">Miriam Elder</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The pair had been identified as suspects in Monday's double bomb attack on the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 170.</p><p>For about two hours on Friday night, Tsarnaev was surrounded by Swat teams and hundreds of other officers, surviving a barrage of gunfire and flash grenades. At 8.41pm ET, it was finally announced over the police radio: \"Suspect in custody\".</p><p>Tsarnaev had been  injured in a shootout with police on Thursday and had suffered significant blood loss. Police said he was in a serious condition in hospital on Friday night.</p><p>When the news came through that Tsarnaev captured alive, Thomas Menino, the mayor of Boston who has struggled through the week with his own health issues, reacted by saying: \"We got him.\" A large crowd gathered near the location of the suspect's arrest began clapping and shouting \"Thank you\" as a police ambulance carrying the suspect drove by.</p><p>At a jubilant press conference after the arrest, the sense of relief among law enforcement officials was palpable.</p><p>Massachusetts police superintendent, Colonel Tim Alben, said: \"We are so grateful to bring justice and closure to this case. We are grateful for the outcome here tonight. We're exhausted, folks, but we have a victory here tonight.\"</p><p>Explaining the breakthrough that had led to Tsarnaev's capture, Edward Deveau, the Watertown police chief, praised local residents. \"It was a call from a resident of Watertown,\" he said. \"We asked you to remain vigilant and you did. We got the call and we got the guy.\"</p><p>Shortly before the the arrest, police in New Bedford, Massachusetts, confirmed that the FBI had taken three people into custody for questioning at a housing complex where Tsarnaev, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, may have lived.</p><p>In a statement at the White House, President Obama said: \"Tonight our nation is in debt to the people of Boston and the people of Massachusetts. All in all, it's been a tough week, but we've seen the character of our country once more.\"</p><p>But he said there were many unanswered questions, particularly with the news that both men had lived in the US for some time. \"Why did young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to this violence?\"</p><p>There are also likely to be questions about the role of the FBI. The Tsarnaevs' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-brothers-parents-innocent-124/\">told Russia Today </a>that the FBI had been in contact with Tamarlan Tsarnaev for between three and five years. </p><p>In the US there were multiple reports that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57580534/fbi-interviewed-dead-boston-bombing-suspect-years-ago/\">FBI officials admitted interviewing him</a> in 2011 on behalf of a foreign government, most likely Russia. The Tsarnaev family were ethnic Chechens; Moscow brutally put down the independence movement in Chechnya during two wars in the 1990s.</p><p>Tsarnaev's apprehension brings to an end five days of high anxiety that began at 2.50pm on Monday, with the blasts, 12 seconds apart, near the finish line of the Boston marathon. The FBI say the brothers had dropped bags containing bombs made from pressure cookers packed with nails and ball bearings.</p><p>A breakthrough in the case came on Thursday evening when police identified two suspects and published their photorgraphs. The drama unfolded quickly: at about 10.30pm on Thursday the two brothers, of Chechen origin, ambushed a police officer, Sean Collier, 26, on the campus of MIT. They then carjacked a black Mercedes, sparking a car chase with police that ended with a huge gunfight in Watertown. </p><p>Pipe bombs and other explosive devices were thrown by the suspects. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed, but Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped on foot.</p><p>More than a million residents of Boston and the surrounding towns had been told to stay inside their homes for most of Friday as hundreds of law enforcement officers went door to door in Watertown searching for Tsarnaev. </p><p>The final flurry of frenzied police activity began shortly before 7pm on Friday, just minutes after police chiefs had come before the TV cameras and told the residents of Watertown that they were ending the lockdown, despite admitting that they had lost track of the suspect.</p><p>A renewed bout of gunfire of about 30 rounds ripped through Watertown as Swat teams and dozens of police vehicles raced to the area of Birch Road, a leafy street with about 14 houses in it.

Local media in Kyrgyzstan quoted police saying they had both been born there. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community.</p><p>According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002. He appears to have spent his formative years in the US and graduated from high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2011. The first of two wars in Chechnya broke out in 1994, a year after he was born. The battles with Moscow spawned Islamic radicalism in the state, leading to deadly attacks on the Moscow metro in 2004 and 2010, and a school in Beslan in 2004.</p><p>Checnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer <a href=\"http://johanneshirn.photoshelter.com/\">Johannes Hirn</a>, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010. One caption in the report, which had been removed from Hirn's website by Friday night, read: \"Unless his native Chechnya becomes independent, Tamerlan says he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia.\" </p><p>The photo essay also showed him to have been committed to his Muslim faith, and poorly integrated in the US. According to Hirn's report, the Chechen once said: \"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.\" </p><p>Friends of Dzhokhar Tsaranaev described him as very differnet from his older brother.

The pair had been identified as suspects in Monday's double bomb attack on the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 170.</p><p>For about two hours on Friday night, Tsarnaev was surrounded by Swat teams and hundreds of other officers, surviving a barrage of gunfire and flash grenades. At 8.41pm ET, it was finally announced over the police radio: \"Suspect in custody\".</p><p>Tsarnaev had been  injured in a shootout with police on Thursday and had suffered significant blood loss. Police said he was in a serious condition in hospital on Friday night.</p><p>When the news came through that Tsarnaev captured alive, Thomas Menino, the mayor of Boston who has struggled through the week with his own health issues, reacted by saying: \"We got him.\" A large crowd gathered near the location of the suspect's arrest began clapping and shouting \"Thank you\" as a police ambulance carrying the suspect drove by.</p><p>At a jubilant press conference after the arrest, the sense of relief among law enforcement officials was palpable.</p><p>Massachusetts police superintendent, Colonel Tim Alben, said: \"We are so grateful to bring justice and closure to this case. We are grateful for the outcome here tonight. We're exhausted, folks, but we have a victory here tonight.\"</p><p>Explaining the breakthrough that had led to Tsarnaev's capture, Edward Deveau, the Watertown police chief, praised local residents. \"It was a call from a resident of Watertown,\" he said. \"We asked you to remain vigilant and you did. We got the call and we got the guy.\"</p><p>Shortly before the the arrest, police in New Bedford, Massachusetts, confirmed that the FBI had taken three people into custody for questioning at a housing complex where Tsarnaev, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, may have lived.</p><p>In a statement at the White House, President Obama said: \"Tonight our nation is in debt to the people of Boston and the people of Massachusetts. All in all, it's been a tough week, but we've seen the character of our country once more.\"</p><p>But he said there were many unanswered questions, particularly with the news that both men had lived in the US for some time. \"Why did young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to this violence?\"</p><p>There are also likely to be questions about the role of the FBI. The Tsarnaevs' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, <a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-brothers-parents-innocent-124/\">told Russia Today </a>that the FBI had been in contact with Tamarlan Tsarnaev for between three and five years. </p><p>In the US there were multiple reports that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57580534/fbi-interviewed-dead-boston-bombing-suspect-years-ago/\">FBI officials admitted interviewing him</a> in 2011 on behalf of a foreign government, most likely Russia. The Tsarnaev family were ethnic Chechens; Moscow brutally put down the independence movement in Chechnya during two wars in the 1990s.</p><p>Tsarnaev's apprehension brings to an end five days of high anxiety that began at 2.50pm on Monday, with the blasts, 12 seconds apart, near the finish line of the Boston marathon. The FBI say the brothers had dropped bags containing bombs made from pressure cookers packed with nails and ball bearings.</p><p>A breakthrough in the case came on Thursday evening when police identified two suspects and published their photorgraphs. The drama unfolded quickly: at about 10.30pm on Thursday the two brothers, of Chechen origin, ambushed a police officer, Sean Collier, 26, on the campus of MIT. They then carjacked a black Mercedes, sparking a car chase with police that ended with a huge gunfight in Watertown. </p><p>Pipe bombs and other explosive devices were thrown by the suspects. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed, but Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped on foot.</p><p>More than a million residents of Boston and the surrounding towns had been told to stay inside their homes for most of Friday as hundreds of law enforcement officers went door to door in Watertown searching for Tsarnaev. </p><p>The final flurry of frenzied police activity began shortly before 7pm on Friday, just minutes after police chiefs had come before the TV cameras and told the residents of Watertown that they were ending the lockdown, despite admitting that they had lost track of the suspect.</p><p>A renewed bout of gunfire of about 30 rounds ripped through Watertown as Swat teams and dozens of police vehicles raced to the area of Birch Road, a leafy street with about 14 houses in it.

More than 200 people were injured.</p><p>As the recovery operation wound down and the last of about 175 damaged homes were cleared, officials said they hoped there might be no more fatalities.</p><p>\"There may be one or two more. It may be that nobody is missing,\" McLennan County judge Scott Felton told a press conference in West, about 20 miles north of Waco.</p><p>Earlier in the day, there were estimates that up to 60 people were still unaccounted for. \"I'd be surprised if it's more than a few,\" Felton said. The confusion arose, he said, because relatives were reporting people missing because they had not been in touch. Many were later located in hotels or staying with friends.</p><p>Donald Adair, owner of the West Fertiliser Company, spoke for the first time about the blast, in giant tanks of ammonia-based chemicals, which sent a huge fireball high into the sky. The National Geological Survey recorded a seismic event of 2.1 magnitude.</p><p>\"As a lifelong resident, my heart is broken with grief for the tragic losses to so many families in our community. Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered,\" Adair said. He also paid tribute to first responders and rescue workers.</p><p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor, toured the stricken town on Friday . \"Now is the time for recovery and to ask the appropriate questions,\" he said.</p><p>Tommy Muska, the West mayor, said most of the dead were emergency personnel who had been responding to an earlier fire at the plant. Five were members of the West volunteer fire department.</p><p>Sergeant Jason Reyes of the Texas public safety department, which co-ordinated the rescue effort, said all the bodies were taken to the Dallas forensic laboratory for identification.</p><p>\"It is with a heavy heart that I can confirm 12 individuals have been recovered from the fertiliser plant explosion. We know these bodies were in the area of the explosion,\" he said.

More than 200 people were injured.</p><p>As the recovery operation wound down and the last of about 175 damaged homes were cleared, officials said they hoped there might be no more fatalities.</p><p>\"There may be one or two more. It may be that nobody is missing,\" McLennan County judge Scott Felton told a press conference in West, about 20 miles north of Waco.</p><p>Earlier in the day, there were estimates that up to 60 people were still unaccounted for. \"I'd be surprised if it's more than a few,\" Felton said. The confusion arose, he said, because relatives were reporting people missing because they had not been in touch. Many were later located in hotels or staying with friends.</p><p>Donald Adair, owner of the West Fertiliser Company, spoke for the first time about the blast, in giant tanks of ammonia-based chemicals, which sent a huge fireball high into the sky. The National Geological Survey recorded a seismic event of 2.1 magnitude.</p><p>\"As a lifelong resident, my heart is broken with grief for the tragic losses to so many families in our community. Our hearts go out to everyone who has suffered,\" Adair said. He also paid tribute to first responders and rescue workers.</p><p>Rick Perry, the Texas governor, toured the stricken town on Friday . \"Now is the time for recovery and to ask the appropriate questions,\" he said.</p><p>Tommy Muska, the West mayor, said most of the dead were emergency personnel who had been responding to an earlier fire at the plant. Five were members of the West volunteer fire department.</p><p>Sergeant Jason Reyes of the Texas public safety department, which co-ordinated the rescue effort, said all the bodies were taken to the Dallas forensic laboratory for identification.</p><p>\"It is with a heavy heart that I can confirm 12 individuals have been recovered from the fertiliser plant explosion. We know these bodies were in the area of the explosion,\" he said. He later updated the number of deaths to 14.</p><p>He said 50 homes were destroyed, along with three fire engines and an ambulance.</p><p>Officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), assisted by the US Chemical Safety Board, have started an inquiry, which could take six months.</p><p>Investigators will focus on which chemicals were stored by the company, which was licensed for 54,000lbs of anhydrous ammonia, a liquid nitrogen agricultural fertiliser that is stored in large reinforced steel tanks.</p><p>Officials at first suggested the explosion was caused by the anhydrous ammonia igniting, but it was revealed on Thursdaythrough Texas state records that the plant also possessed 270 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a much more volatile, dry solid, at the end of 2012.

The Czech Inn is five minutes' drive from the blast site and most of its 70 rooms are occupied by displaced, disheveled residents.</p><p>A wide area around the plant remained sealed off by police on Friday as frustration grew among those unable to return to their houses – or what remains of them.</p><p>Andrew Malinovsky said that his home about 11 blocks from the plant had largely escaped damage but that he was not permitted to get back to access his medicine. \"I'm a diabetic, disabled veteran. They won't even let me get to my house to get the essential stuff I need to live: medications, my breathing machine,\" he said in the hotel lobby.</p><p>Malinovsky was sitting in his living room when the plant exploded. \"It was like somebody went wham and slapped my whole body from front and back,\" he said.</p><p>Anissa Adamson was relieved that her son happened to be on an evening shift at the Czech Stop bakery and convenience store on Wednesday night. He lives next to the plant in an apartment complex that is now just a tattered metal skeleton. \"We're lucky, everyone in my family got out,\" she said. Most of her relatives live close to the plant but only one cousin required hospital treatment. Adamson herself moved out of her son's building less than three weeks ago.  </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday night at a packed church service for the victims near West's modest downtown, many wearing red and white jerseys bearing the logo of the town's beloved Trojans high school football team. The field was used as a triage center. \"Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere,\" Father Ed Karasek told mourners. T-shirts that say \"GOD BLESS WEST\" are now in fashion.</p><p>International media, charities, politicians and state and federal agencies are crowding a town that normally only expects to welcome large numbers of outsiders for its annual Czech heritage festival.</p><p>Even before the number of dead and their names have been formally confirmed, even while locals can only assess the destruction from gossip among neighbours and the apocalyptic footage being aired again and again on television news, life's practical necessities are imposing a framework on this crushed community, giving it structure amid the shock.</p><p>Roads are busy. Many shops are open. Spirited polka music was pumped out from the Village Bakery on to a sidewalk still littered with broken glass from shattered windows. Children need to go back to school on Monday – somewhere. An insurance company has set up a stall outside an antiques shop.</p><p>Another has parked a mobile crisis response unit at the main entrance to the town, the Stars and Stripes on its tall portable flagpole whipping from side to side in the heavy breeze. A Dallas-based law firm issued a press release saying it is \"investigating possible lawsuits\" – call now!</p><p>At the moment the town is still too traumatised to think about recriminations, still more interested in compassion than consequences. The cause of the disaster remained unclear Friday afternoon. Adamson said she did not blame them for anything. \"It's not their fault, I know those people. We don't point fingers here, we just help,\" she said. \"Bad things happen to good people.\"</p><p>One of those presumed dead was Joey Pustejovsky, a West volunteer firefighter, the City Secretary. \"I worked with him for a while, he seemed to be doing a really good job, very dedicated … he had a lot of ambition,\" said Suzy Price, a semi-retired photographer.</p><p>Jimmy Matus, owner of a welding business, is also reported to have perished.

The Czech Inn is five minutes' drive from the blast site and most of its 70 rooms are occupied by displaced, disheveled residents.</p><p>A wide area around the plant remained sealed off by police on Friday as frustration grew among those unable to return to their houses – or what remains of them.</p><p>Andrew Malinovsky said that his home about 11 blocks from the plant had largely escaped damage but that he was not permitted to get back to access his medicine. \"I'm a diabetic, disabled veteran. They won't even let me get to my house to get the essential stuff I need to live: medications, my breathing machine,\" he said in the hotel lobby.</p><p>Malinovsky was sitting in his living room when the plant exploded. \"It was like somebody went wham and slapped my whole body from front and back,\" he said.</p><p>Anissa Adamson was relieved that her son happened to be on an evening shift at the Czech Stop bakery and convenience store on Wednesday night. He lives next to the plant in an apartment complex that is now just a tattered metal skeleton. \"We're lucky, everyone in my family got out,\" she said. Most of her relatives live close to the plant but only one cousin required hospital treatment. Adamson herself moved out of her son's building less than three weeks ago.  </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday night at a packed church service for the victims near West's modest downtown, many wearing red and white jerseys bearing the logo of the town's beloved Trojans high school football team. The field was used as a triage center. \"Our town of West will never be the same, but we will persevere,\" Father Ed Karasek told mourners. T-shirts that say \"GOD BLESS WEST\" are now in fashion.</p><p>International media, charities, politicians and state and federal agencies are crowding a town that normally only expects to welcome large numbers of outsiders for its annual Czech heritage festival.</p><p>Even before the number of dead and their names have been formally confirmed, even while locals can only assess the destruction from gossip among neighbours and the apocalyptic footage being aired again and again on television news, life's practical necessities are imposing a framework on this crushed community, giving it structure amid the shock.</p><p>Roads are busy. Many shops are open. Spirited polka music was pumped out from the Village Bakery on to a sidewalk still littered with broken glass from shattered windows. Children need to go back to school on Monday – somewhere. An insurance company has set up a stall outside an antiques shop.</p><p>Another has parked a mobile crisis response unit at the main entrance to the town, the Stars and Stripes on its tall portable flagpole whipping from side to side in the heavy breeze. A Dallas-based law firm issued a press release saying it is \"investigating possible lawsuits\" – call now!</p><p>At the moment the town is still too traumatised to think about recriminations, still more interested in compassion than consequences. The cause of the disaster remained unclear Friday afternoon. Adamson said she did not blame them for anything. \"It's not their fault, I know those people. We don't point fingers here, we just help,\" she said. \"Bad things happen to good people.\"</p><p>One of those presumed dead was Joey Pustejovsky, a West volunteer firefighter, the City Secretary. \"I worked with him for a while, he seemed to be doing a really good job, very dedicated … he had a lot of ambition,\" said Suzy Price, a semi-retired photographer.</p><p>Jimmy Matus, owner of a welding business, is also reported to have perished. A friend said he restored old fire trucks and used to dress up with his wife as Mr and Mrs Santa Claus to greet kids at community events. She died in 2011, aged 52. Also believed dead is \"Buck\" Uptmor, owner of a fencing company, and former rodeo rider, who was helping a man move horses to safety.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas-fertiliser-plant-explosion\">Texas fertiliser plant explosion</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-dart\">Tom Dart</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who has been described as \"very relaxed\", appears to be grinning, his dark curls covered by a white baseball cap. His older brother, Tamerlan, shields his eyes with sunglasses, his mouth slightly open as he stares ahead.</p><p>The two ethnic Chechens, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-mit-police-dead-watertown\">who were identified on Friday as the chief suspects in the bombings</a>, followed a convoluted path to the United States, like so many from the troubled Russian republic. Although it appears that they never lived in Chechnya, which has spent much of the past two decades racked by war, they maintained close ties to its culture.</p><p>There are conflicting reports in regards to the birth places of the Tsarnaev brothers. Local police, cited in Kyrgyz media, suggest that both were born in Kyrgyzstan. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community, which developed after Josef Stalin expelled hundreds of thousands of Chechens around central Asia during the second world war.</p><p>Little is known of the brothers' time in Kyrgyzstan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tamerlan-tsarnaev-american-life-of-dead-boston-bomb-suspect\">who was shot dead by Boston police in the early hours of Friday morning</a>, was born in 1986. His younger brother, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-suspect-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-school\">19 and on the run</a>, was born in July 1993. The following year, Chechnya would break out into the first of two wars, as it fought to secede from Russia in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Moscow responded with unbridled brutality, being accused of widespread human rights abuses against the civilian population. The rebels in the mainly Muslim republic grew ever more Islamist.</p><p>The Tsarnaev family moved to Dagestan, a Muslim republic neighbouring Chechnya, sometime between 1999 and 2001. According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, the younger Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002.</p><p>The family appears to have settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But according to US law enforcement officials cited by the Wall Street Journal, the two brothers arrived separately: one with his parents in 2002, the other in 2004. The officials said that one or both of the brothers had returned to the Caucasus for some time after emigrating to the US.</p><p>Tamerlan is thought to have spent around six months of last year out of the US, during which time he saw his father in Dagestan. Anzor Tsarnaev told the New York Times that during the visit he and his son \"went to Chechnya to visit relatives\".</p><p>Authorities in Chechnya, in the midst of a massive campaign to show that life in the republic has normalised despite a continuing low-level insurgency, harshly denied any links to the brothers. \"Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if found guilty, is in vain,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tsarnaev-brothers-chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov\">the republic's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, wrote on Instagram on Friday</a>. \"They grew up in the US, their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America.\"</p><p>Yet the brothers left internet evidence that showed their deep ties to the republic. The last entry on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's page on VKontakte, posted on 19 March, shows a video of his brother humorously imitating various accents from the region, in fluent Russian. It shows that among the three groups to which he belongs are \"Chechen's\" and \"Chechnya: Everything about the Chechen Republic\".</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev's links run even deeper. A YouTube account that appears to have been run by the elder Tsarnaev includes a playlist devoted to Timur Mutsuraev, a Chechen singer now in exile who sang of the republic's battle for freedom from Russia. His account also includes a playlist devoted to \"terrorism\", including one video in English entitled \"The Emergence of Prophecy: The Black Flags from Khorasan\". He also maintained a playlist devoted to Islam.</p><p>Chechnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer Johannes Hirn, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who has been described as \"very relaxed\", appears to be grinning, his dark curls covered by a white baseball cap. His older brother, Tamerlan, shields his eyes with sunglasses, his mouth slightly open as he stares ahead.</p><p>The two ethnic Chechens, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-mit-police-dead-watertown\">who were identified on Friday as the chief suspects in the bombings</a>, followed a convoluted path to the United States, like so many from the troubled Russian republic. Although it appears that they never lived in Chechnya, which has spent much of the past two decades racked by war, they maintained close ties to its culture.</p><p>There are conflicting reports in regards to the birth places of the Tsarnaev brothers. Local police, cited in Kyrgyz media, suggest that both were born in Kyrgyzstan. But family members in the US said the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was born in Dagestan. The brothers are thought to have spent some of their youth in the city of Tomok, the centre of Kyrgyzstan's Chechen community, which developed after Josef Stalin expelled hundreds of thousands of Chechens around central Asia during the second world war.</p><p>Little is known of the brothers' time in Kyrgyzstan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tamerlan-tsarnaev-american-life-of-dead-boston-bomb-suspect\">who was shot dead by Boston police in the early hours of Friday morning</a>, was born in 1986. His younger brother, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-suspect-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-school\">19 and on the run</a>, was born in July 1993. The following year, Chechnya would break out into the first of two wars, as it fought to secede from Russia in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. Moscow responded with unbridled brutality, being accused of widespread human rights abuses against the civilian population. The rebels in the mainly Muslim republic grew ever more Islamist.</p><p>The Tsarnaev family moved to Dagestan, a Muslim republic neighbouring Chechnya, sometime between 1999 and 2001. According to his page on the Russian social network VKontakte, the younger Tsarnaev attended School Number One in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. Irina Bandurina, an administrator at the school, said Tsarnaev studied there in 2001, after moving from Kyrgyzstan, and left for the United States in 2002.</p><p>The family appears to have settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But according to US law enforcement officials cited by the Wall Street Journal, the two brothers arrived separately: one with his parents in 2002, the other in 2004. The officials said that one or both of the brothers had returned to the Caucasus for some time after emigrating to the US.</p><p>Tamerlan is thought to have spent around six months of last year out of the US, during which time he saw his father in Dagestan. Anzor Tsarnaev told the New York Times that during the visit he and his son \"went to Chechnya to visit relatives\".</p><p>Authorities in Chechnya, in the midst of a massive campaign to show that life in the republic has normalised despite a continuing low-level insurgency, harshly denied any links to the brothers. \"Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if found guilty, is in vain,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/tsarnaev-brothers-chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov\">the republic's leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, wrote on Instagram on Friday</a>. \"They grew up in the US, their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America.\"</p><p>Yet the brothers left internet evidence that showed their deep ties to the republic. The last entry on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's page on VKontakte, posted on 19 March, shows a video of his brother humorously imitating various accents from the region, in fluent Russian. It shows that among the three groups to which he belongs are \"Chechen's\" and \"Chechnya: Everything about the Chechen Republic\".</p><p>Tamerlan Tsarnaev's links run even deeper. A YouTube account that appears to have been run by the elder Tsarnaev includes a playlist devoted to Timur Mutsuraev, a Chechen singer now in exile who sang of the republic's battle for freedom from Russia. His account also includes a playlist devoted to \"terrorism\", including one video in English entitled \"The Emergence of Prophecy: The Black Flags from Khorasan\". He also maintained a playlist devoted to Islam.</p><p>Chechnya's separatist cause struck Tamerlan Tsarnaev deeply, according to a report by photographer Johannes Hirn, who profiled the young Chechen when he was training for a boxing match in 2010. One caption in the report reads: \"Unless his native Chechnya becomes independent, Tamerlan says he would rather compete for the United States than for Russia.\" The elder Tsarnaev fought for a while as a competitive boxer, taking time off from his studies at Bunker Hill community college in Charleston, Massachusetts.</p><p>The report also shows him to have been very religious, and poorly integrated in the US. According to Hirn's report, the Chechen once said: \"I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.\" In 2009, Tsarnaev was reportedly arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. His aunt, who lives in Canada, told reporters on Friday that the elder brother had married and that the couple had a three-year-old daughter living in the US.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kyrgyzstan\">Kyrgyzstan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder\">Miriam Elder</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
