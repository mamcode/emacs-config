A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems. Death often follows such a collapse.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That's why it was so easy for people to jump on to reports that a Saudi national had been a person of interest.  There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil.

Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news. Reporting the supreme court verdict on Obama's healthcare reforms, it wrongly reported that the individual mandate part of the legislation had been struck down. The mistake was later blamed on a producer who had jumped the gun.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/boston-globe\">Boston Globe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/cnn\">CNN</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/associated-press\">Associated Press</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said.

In 2010 two female suicide bombers from Dagestan blew up the Moscow metro, killing at least 40 people and injuring 100. A year later another suicide bomber struck Moscow's Domodedovo airport; he killed 37 and wounded 180. There have been murderous attacks including the one on a school in Beslan in 2004, where 334 hostages died, most of them children.</p><p>But the bombing of the Boston Marathon, which police suspect was perpetrated by two Chechen brothers, Dzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are something altogether new. It is so far unclear how significant is the trail that appears to lead from the mountains of the North Caucasus – the scene of a simmering ongoing insurgency – to the boulevards and suburban houses of North America.</p><p>After 18 years, two wars, and the loss of hundreds of thousands of civilian lives the conflict in Chechnya and Russia's southern backyard more generally has changed. From 1994 to 1996 Boris Yeltsin fought a war against mainly secular Chechen separatists who wanted – like other ethnic republics after the collapse of the USSR – their own nationalist and constitutional state. In the period 1999-2004 Vladimir Putin – Yeltsin's steely successor – fought a second Chechen war. The aim was to definitively crush Chechen separatism.</p><p>In recent years, however, the Kremlin and its regional proxies have been battling a different kind of enemy. This new generation of insurgents has an explicitly Islamist goal: to create a radical pan-Caucasian emirate ruled by Islamic law, a sort of Afghanistan under the Taliban. The movement's leader, Doku Umarov, unveiled this ambitious vision in 2007. He vowed to liberate not only Russia's Muslim North Caucasus but a large chunk of European Russia.</p><p>Umarov also suggested that devout Muslims should think internationally. His comments, later softened, said: \"Today in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Palestine our brothers are fighting. Everyone who attacks Muslims wherever they are are our enemies, common enemies. Our enemy is not Russia only, but everyone who wages war against Islam and Muslims.\"</p><p>This call to global jihad may perhaps offer a motive for an attack inside the US. The new generation of twentysomething rebels is also exploiting a powerful new weapon: the internet. The main Chechen rebel website, kavkazcenter.com, posts reports from the jihadi movement worldwide: from Syria, where Chechen diaspora fighters are battling government forces in Aleppo, from Pakistan, and from Turkey.</p><p>Over in the North Caucausus, meanwhile, the Kremlin is carrying out a brutal and rolling counter-insurgency campaign. Its focus is Dagestan, the neighbouring state to Chechnya, and now a hotbed of violent jihadist rebellion. Three weeks ago Umarov appealed to Chechen fighters abroad to come home to take part in the fight.</p><p>Cerwyn Moore, an expert on the insurgency in southern Russia at Birmingham University, said he was surprised it may have spilled over into the United States. \"It's a marked change. It seems very odd. There have never been attacks like this outside Russia.\" He added: \"You have a group of people who have lived outside Chechnya because of the second Chechen war.

In 2010 two female suicide bombers from Dagestan blew up the Moscow metro, killing at least 40 people and injuring 100. A year later another suicide bomber struck Moscow's Domodedovo airport; he killed 37 and wounded 180. There have been murderous attacks including the one on a school in Beslan in 2004, where 334 hostages died, most of them children.</p><p>But the bombing of the Boston Marathon, which police suspect was perpetrated by two Chechen brothers, Dzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are something altogether new. It is so far unclear how significant is the trail that appears to lead from the mountains of the North Caucasus – the scene of a simmering ongoing insurgency – to the boulevards and suburban houses of North America.</p><p>After 18 years, two wars, and the loss of hundreds of thousands of civilian lives the conflict in Chechnya and Russia's southern backyard more generally has changed. From 1994 to 1996 Boris Yeltsin fought a war against mainly secular Chechen separatists who wanted – like other ethnic republics after the collapse of the USSR – their own nationalist and constitutional state. In the period 1999-2004 Vladimir Putin – Yeltsin's steely successor – fought a second Chechen war. The aim was to definitively crush Chechen separatism.</p><p>In recent years, however, the Kremlin and its regional proxies have been battling a different kind of enemy. This new generation of insurgents has an explicitly Islamist goal: to create a radical pan-Caucasian emirate ruled by Islamic law, a sort of Afghanistan under the Taliban. The movement's leader, Doku Umarov, unveiled this ambitious vision in 2007. He vowed to liberate not only Russia's Muslim North Caucasus but a large chunk of European Russia.</p><p>Umarov also suggested that devout Muslims should think internationally. His comments, later softened, said: \"Today in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Palestine our brothers are fighting. Everyone who attacks Muslims wherever they are are our enemies, common enemies. Our enemy is not Russia only, but everyone who wages war against Islam and Muslims.\"</p><p>This call to global jihad may perhaps offer a motive for an attack inside the US. The new generation of twentysomething rebels is also exploiting a powerful new weapon: the internet. The main Chechen rebel website, kavkazcenter.com, posts reports from the jihadi movement worldwide: from Syria, where Chechen diaspora fighters are battling government forces in Aleppo, from Pakistan, and from Turkey.</p><p>Over in the North Caucausus, meanwhile, the Kremlin is carrying out a brutal and rolling counter-insurgency campaign. Its focus is Dagestan, the neighbouring state to Chechnya, and now a hotbed of violent jihadist rebellion. Three weeks ago Umarov appealed to Chechen fighters abroad to come home to take part in the fight.</p><p>Cerwyn Moore, an expert on the insurgency in southern Russia at Birmingham University, said he was surprised it may have spilled over into the United States. \"It's a marked change. It seems very odd. There have never been attacks like this outside Russia.\" He added: \"You have a group of people who have lived outside Chechnya because of the second Chechen war. This is also an inter-generational thing.\"</p><p>Odd or not, the Boston bombings play perfectly into the Kremlin's hands, ahead of Russia's 2014 Winter Olympics, to be hosted in Sochi, not far from where the current insurgency is raging. It reinforces Putin's claim – first made in 1999 – that his violent methods are justified to quell a ruthless rebellion by terrorists prepared to take innocent lives.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/chechnya\">Chechnya</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lukeharding\">Luke Harding</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He was pronounced dead at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p>\"Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling,\" <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/victim-identified-as-sean-collier-0419.html\">MIT police chief John DiFava said in a statement</a>. \"He was born to be a police officer.\"</p><p>Collier had served on the MIT police force since 9 January 2012. He was also a member of the school's Outing Club, which organizes outdoor activities for the university community. \"In a very short period of time, it was remarkable how engaged he was with students, particularly graduate students,\" DiFava said.</p><p>Previously, Collier was a civilian employee at the Somerville police department, just north of Boston. He was raised in the north-eastern Massachusetts city of Wilmington, and was single.</p><p>The shooting took place at about 10.30pm. Shortly after, police received reports of an armed car-jacking on the MIT campus in Cambridge.</p><p>In a statement released Friday, MIT said it was \"heartbroken\" by the news. \"Our thoughts are now with the family,\" MIT said. The school cancelled classes, and employees were urged not to come to campus. The school dedicated its website to the officer on Friday – the homepage is now mainly black and includes a large image of the MIT police badge. </p><p>Isabel Ruiz, the MIT executive vice-president and treasurer, and chancellor Eric Grimson, sent a letter to members of the MIT community. It read: \"While the circumstances around the officer's death remain the subject of an active investigation, what is certain is that the officer gave his life to defend the peace of our campus. His sacrifice will never be forgotten by the Institute.

He was pronounced dead at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p>\"Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling,\" <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/victim-identified-as-sean-collier-0419.html\">MIT police chief John DiFava said in a statement</a>. \"He was born to be a police officer.\"</p><p>Collier had served on the MIT police force since 9 January 2012. He was also a member of the school's Outing Club, which organizes outdoor activities for the university community. \"In a very short period of time, it was remarkable how engaged he was with students, particularly graduate students,\" DiFava said.</p><p>Previously, Collier was a civilian employee at the Somerville police department, just north of Boston. He was raised in the north-eastern Massachusetts city of Wilmington, and was single.</p><p>The shooting took place at about 10.30pm. Shortly after, police received reports of an armed car-jacking on the MIT campus in Cambridge.</p><p>In a statement released Friday, MIT said it was \"heartbroken\" by the news. \"Our thoughts are now with the family,\" MIT said. The school cancelled classes, and employees were urged not to come to campus. The school dedicated its website to the officer on Friday – the homepage is now mainly black and includes a large image of the MIT police badge. </p><p>Isabel Ruiz, the MIT executive vice-president and treasurer, and chancellor Eric Grimson, sent a letter to members of the MIT community. It read: \"While the circumstances around the officer's death remain the subject of an active investigation, what is certain is that the officer gave his life to defend the peace of our campus. His sacrifice will never be forgotten by the Institute.

It was here, at about 10.20pm on Thursday night, that an extroardinary sequence of events began to unfold.</p><p>The first incident reported to police was an armed robbery at a 7-Eleven store in the square. A man in a grey hooded top was captured on digital footage taken by a security camera in the store.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a young MIT police officer called Sean Collier responded to reports of a disturbance on the campus itself. He drove his patrol car to Kendall Square, at the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets.</p><p>The location is among the most prized pieces of academic real estate in the world. Right next to it is the Stata Center, a building constructed in the architect Frank Gehry's trademark sweeps of twisted metal that houses the offices of philosopher Noam Chomsky and the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee.</p><p>Collier, 26, who had worked as a police officer for just a year, did not have the chance to check out the reported disturbance, or do anything else. He was set upon by two people in what police described as an ambush, and shot multiple times as he sat in his police cruiser. He was rushed to Massachusetts General hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p><p>\"MIT is heartbroken by the news that an MIT police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty on campus,\" the institute said later.</p><p>The horrifying events at MIT were just the start of a frenzied night of violence and fear. Shortly after Collier was shot, 911 calls came in reporting an armed carjacking of a black Mercedes SUV took place in Third Street, on the edge of the MIT campus.</p><p>The owner of the car was ordered by the two armed carjackers to go down Memorial Drive, which runs along the banks of the Charles river basin. There are unconfirmed reports that during the time the car owner was kept kidnapped within his own vehicle, his captors admitted to him that they were the Boston marathon bombers.</p><p>Only six hours previously, the FBI had released to the public photographs of two men they said were suspects in the bombing. Suspect One was a heavy-set man wearing a black baseball hat and black jacket; Suspect Two was younger and slighter, wearing a grey hoodie and a white baseball cap turned backwards.</p><h2>'Extremely dangerous'</h2><p>The Boston FBI chief, Rick DesLauriers, who has led the massive hunt for the bombers involving more than 1,000 federal agents, warned the public at that press conference that the two suspects were armed and \"considered extremely dangerous\". He said that no-one should approach them under any circumstances.</p><p>According to Boston police, the Mercedes owner was set free by his kidnappers at a petrol station along Memorial Drive about half an hour after they forcefully took over his car. The two men then sped off along Memorial Drive in the direction of Watertown, a suburb in the north-western side of Boston.</p><p>As they tore off into the night, the speeding Mercedes was chased by a lengthening convoy of law enforcers. Local and state police, as well as federal agents, joined in the chase that ended in Watertown, a town of about 30,000.</p><p>Before the Mercedes screeched to a halt, the two fugitives threw explosive devices out of the windows of the vehicle, including metal items that local residents described as looking like pressure cookers - the crude but terrifyingly powerful homemade devices that had been used to kill three people and injure more than 170 at the marathon bombing. One of the devices exploded as it was propelled from the car, causing a large fireball.</p><p>Loretta Kehayias, 65, a local resident, said the explosions \"lit up the whole house. I screamed. I've never seen anything like this. Never, never, never.\"</p><p>Police officers shouted at people in the street that suspects were \"throwing explosives\" and warned of \"unexploded ordnance\" on the street.</p><p>As the Mercedes came to a stop, a huge gunfight erupted with the pursuing police officers. A local resident near Dexter Avenue and Laurel Street in Watertown recorded on her cell phone the exchange of fire. The intense blast of shooting lasted for several minutes and sounded like a war zone.</p><p>In the course of the gunfight, one of the scores of officers involved, Richard Donahue of the Boston Transit police, was shot. Donahue, 33 and with a six-month-old baby, was taken to Mt Auburn hospital were he remains in critical condition.</p><p>Twenty other police officers from Watertown and other units were also given hospital treatment as a result of the explosive devices launched from the fugitives' Mercedes.</p><p>There was one other important casualty in the gunfight. A man with dark hair was seen lying in the middle of Laurel Street, his armed splayed out, with about 15 armed police surrounding him.</p><p>He was later identified as Suspect One, the man with the black baseball hat caught on security cameras walking along Boylston Street towards the finishing line of the marathon, a large black backpack slung on his shoulders, shortly before Monday's blasts. After police had secured the scene, Suspect One was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess medical center at about 1.10am and taken immediately into the operating room.</p><p>He was pronounced dead at about 1.35am. Dr Richard Wolfe of Beth Israel reported that he had suffered not just gunshot wounds, but \"a combination of injuries. We believe a combination of blasts and multiple gunshot wounds.\"</p><p>The revelation that one of the suspects had died partially from blast injuries seemed to correlate with reports that police had found a suicide vest strapped to Suspect One's chest.</p><p>Suspect Two managed to elude the enormous army of law enforcers that had by now assembled in Watertown. He appears to have carjacked a dark green SUV and drove it at high speed a little way down the street, before leaping out of the car and escaping on foot.</p><p>The car was followed by a hail of police fire. The back window of the SUV was shattered, and up to 92 bullet casings were counted around the vehicle during a later police investigation of the crime scene.</p><h2>'Bullet hole through our wall and the chair'</h2><p>The prolonged firefight involving the two men was captured in real time on Twitter. Andrew Kitzenberg, who lives in Laurel Street, had been watching a sports game on TV when he heard commotion right outside his three-floor window.</p><p>\"I heard gunshots. I peeked through the window and saw two shooters between two cars,\" he tweeted at around 1am.</p><p>Kitzenberg witnessed the two suspects in \"constant gunfire\" with officers. One of his tweets, accompanied by a digital picture showing two women cowering at the bottom of a stairwell, said: \"Bullet hole through our wall and the chair.\"</p><p>Kitzenberg, who unexpectedly had just become a highly-followed citizen reporter, watched as a police car drove at high speed towards the shooters, but then spun out of control and crashed into cars parked along the sidewalk. \"Crashed cop car with all windows shot out in our driveway,\"  he tweeted under his handle @kitz.</p><p>A Laurel Street neighbour of Kitzenberg's, who was not named, also gave an account of the events to local reporters. At about 1am, he said, he was awoken by the sound of gunfire.</p><p>\"I saw two individuals in a car that had stopped suddenly. The windows had been blown out and they were firing in the direction of Dexter Street. Then a police cruiser lost control and crashed into my neighbour's car.\"</p><p>As a sign of the chaos that engulfed the chase, when the neighbour called 911 to report the shootout, the emergency dispatcher sound surprised and was evidently unaware of what was going on.</p><p>Later, the witness saw a police bomb-disposal robot brought in to investigate what looked to him like a pressure cooker lying on the road.</p><p>Once the firefight was over, the hunt focused on Suspect Two, the man now known as \"White Cap\", who was still at large. At about 3am the head of Boston police, Ed Davis, told reporters assembled at the edge of a 20-block exclusion zone that had been set up that Suspect Two was still considered extremely dangerous. \"We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people, and we need to get him in custody.\"</p><p>Police chiefs also confirmed at that point what everybody had already been surmising – that the two fugitives were the same suspects whose photographs had been released on Thursday evening in the hunt for the Boston marathon bombers. Later in the morning, they were identified as Chechen brothers – Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was by now dead, and the younger \"White Cap\" suspect Dzhokhar Tsamaev, 19, who was still on the run.</p><p>From about 1.30am the suburb of Watertown and the entire greater Boston area remained in a prolonged state of siege. At about 4am it was announced by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick that public transport in the whole region had been shut down – Boston, who President Obama on Thursday called one of the \"world's great cities\" had effectively been put into lockdown.</p><p>\"Do not open your doors,\" was the message from Commissioner Davis to the people of the city. \"Stay in your home. We believe this man to be a terrorist and we need to get him into custody.\"</p><p>Ten hours into the search for Dzhokhar Tsamaev, a 19-year-old now on his own and facing the combined forces of America's most highly trained and heavily armed law enforcement agencies, there was still no sign of him. Swat teams carrying long rifles and carrying protective shields were sent door to door in the hunt, clearing up to 60% of Watertown by midday, with backup from bomb squads and a long line of military armoured vehicles.</p><p>Officers swept on two locations in Watertown and swarmed them for periods of up to an hour, but in both occasions the search ended in frustration. The operation remains frenzied and nervous, made all the more twitchy by the awareness that White Cap might have strapped himself with a suicide vest as his brother appears to have done.</p><p>Hours after the start of the drama in Central Square, Suspect Two remained unapprehended and Boston ground to a standstill. A daze of sheer disbelief hung over Watertown, and the region, and the whole of America.</p><p>Boston's mayor, Thomas Menino, appeared at lunchtime in front of the world's television cameras. He said the words that he has repeated all week, since carnage ripped through his city on marathon day.</p><p>\"We will get through this, we are a strong city, we will not be intimidated by terrorists,\" he said. But there was a difference: this time the mayor's voice sounded shaky.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tamerlan-tsarnaev\">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism\">Global terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia\">Russia</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was here, at about 10.20pm on Thursday night, that an extroardinary sequence of events began to unfold.</p><p>The first incident reported to police was an armed robbery at a 7-Eleven store in the square. A man in a grey hooded top was captured on digital footage taken by a security camera in the store.</p><p>Ten minutes later, a young MIT police officer called Sean Collier responded to reports of a disturbance on the campus itself. He drove his patrol car to Kendall Square, at the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets.</p><p>The location is among the most prized pieces of academic real estate in the world. Right next to it is the Stata Center, a building constructed in the architect Frank Gehry's trademark sweeps of twisted metal that houses the offices of philosopher Noam Chomsky and the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee.</p><p>Collier, 26, who had worked as a police officer for just a year, did not have the chance to check out the reported disturbance, or do anything else. He was set upon by two people in what police described as an ambush, and shot multiple times as he sat in his police cruiser.

Being losers, and hatred of those who were able to settle themselves</p><p><em>This is an edited transcript of the statement made by Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, to reporters in Montgomery Village, Maryland on Friday 19 April 2013:</em></p><p>The purpose here is just to deliver condolences and to share grief with the victims here, those who have been murdered, those who were injured – this boy, this Chinese girl, the young 29-year-old girl – I've been following this from day one. But I never ever would imagine that, somehow, the children of my brother would be associated with that.</p><p>So it is [an] atrocity. We're devastated; we're shocked. I don't know – this family doesn't know – how to share that grief with the real victims.</p><p>We've not been in touch with that family [the Tsarnaevs] for a number of years. They never lived here. The last time I saw them was December 2005.</p><p>I never knew they had any ill will towards United States. If I ever had a guess, I would have submitted them myself. [What provoked this was] Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves – these are the only reasons I can imagine. Anything else, anything else – to do with religion, with Islam – is a fraud, is a fake. [They had no military training, since] I've seen them when they were kids.</p><p>We're Muslims, Chechens, ethnic Chechens. Most likely, somebody radicalized them, but it's not my brother who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars. He didn't have time or chance, or any option: he's been working. I've not been in touch with my brother.</p><p>My family has nothing to do with that family. Of course, we are ashamed. They are children of my brother, who had little influence on them, honestly, as much as I know. It's personal: I just wanted my family to be away from them.</p><p>Again, I say what I think was behind it: being losers. Not being able to settle themselves. And thereby just hating everyone who did.</p><p>They came early in 2003. They moved to the States. They came to Cambridge. They immigrated; they received asylum. They lived there. When they grew up, my family had nothing to do with that family for a long time.

Being losers, and hatred of those who were able to settle themselves</p><p><em>This is an edited transcript of the statement made by Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, to reporters in Montgomery Village, Maryland on Friday 19 April 2013:</em></p><p>The purpose here is just to deliver condolences and to share grief with the victims here, those who have been murdered, those who were injured – this boy, this Chinese girl, the young 29-year-old girl – I've been following this from day one. But I never ever would imagine that, somehow, the children of my brother would be associated with that.</p><p>So it is [an] atrocity. We're devastated; we're shocked. I don't know – this family doesn't know – how to share that grief with the real victims.</p><p>We've not been in touch with that family [the Tsarnaevs] for a number of years. They never lived here. The last time I saw them was December 2005.</p><p>I never knew they had any ill will towards United States. If I ever had a guess, I would have submitted them myself. [What provoked this was] Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves – these are the only reasons I can imagine. Anything else, anything else – to do with religion, with Islam – is a fraud, is a fake. [They had no military training, since] I've seen them when they were kids.</p><p>We're Muslims, Chechens, ethnic Chechens. Most likely, somebody radicalized them, but it's not my brother who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars. He didn't have time or chance, or any option: he's been working. I've not been in touch with my brother.</p><p>My family has nothing to do with that family. Of course, we are ashamed. They are children of my brother, who had little influence on them, honestly, as much as I know. It's personal: I just wanted my family to be away from them.</p><p>Again, I say what I think was behind it: being losers. Not being able to settle themselves. And thereby just hating everyone who did.</p><p>They came early in 2003. They moved to the States. They came to Cambridge. They immigrated; they received asylum. They lived there. When they grew up, my family had nothing to do with that family for a long time. Last time I spoke with them was 2009.</p><p>I say, I teach my children – and this is what I feel myself: this is the ideal micro-world and entire world. I respect this country. I love this country. This country which gives chance to everybody else to be treated as a human being, to be a big human being, to fulfil yourself as a human being. That's what I feel about this country.</p><p>I just see them as kids, and if I had even slightly been aware that they were involved in [terrorism], I would be the first one to bring them into responsibility as their uncle.</p><p>They never been in Chechnya. They had nothing to do with Chechnya. Chechens are different: Chechens are peaceful people. They were not born there. One of them, Dzhokhar, he was born in Kyrgyzstan, that's a neighboring region to Chechnya.</p><p>I saw their pictures only this morning when I was contacted from 7am with reporters. When they said have you seen the pictures, my wife opened up internet and I saw a picture of Dzhokhar.</p><p>[To Dzhokhar,] I would say, \"If you're alive, turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness, from the victims, from the injured, and from those who left.

He put a shame on the entire Chechen ethnicity, because everyone now names [Chechen], they play with that word Chechen. So they put that shame on the entire ethnicity. I would say, \"Turn yourself in, and put yourself in the discretion of those who are here.\"</p><p>[…] Again, with the families of those who suffered, we're sharing them their grief.

Both completed their first London marathon last year and are running again for Action Medical Research. \"It was the best day of my life. We crossed the finishing line together holding hands. The crowd was amazing,\" said Sinagra.</p><p>\"I watched the news Monday night and I was very, very sad for the runners and all the families. It's supposed to be a day of joy and sharing. Sunday will be very emotional because all the runners will run for the same cause.\"</p><p>James Wright, who had travelled from Oldham with his wife Della and hopes to complete the race dressed as Little Miss Chatterbox, predicted that crowds would turn out in even greater numbers in light of events in Boston. \"You can't let them stop you. It's two fingers up to anyone who wants to try and stop us.\"</p><p>Typically, a crowd of around half a million throngs the 26.2 mile route that starts in Blackheath in south east London and ends on the Mall, and lends the event its unique atmosphere.</p><p>Among the runners will be Dr Jack Holland, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Surrey and an expert on terrorism and security policy. In a blog written in the aftermath of the bombing, he wrote: \"'Carry on' has been a prominent British response to the events in Massachusetts. And that is not a bad start. So while Boston's 26th mile was dedicated, tragically, to the victims of the Newtown shootings, many running the London Marathon on Sunday will do so with Boston in mind.\"</p><p>The elite runners also insisted that the Boston bombings would not deter them. Mo Farah, who is running the first half of the marathon in preparation for a tilt at the full distance next year, said: \"My support goes out to all the people involved, their families and loved ones. But they would want us to carry on and show our support. Why would you let it stop you?\"</p><p>The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said the extra security measures and added police numbers were to provide \"reassurance\". \"If we thought there was anything there that should stop people going out onto the streets, we would say so and we would call the whole thing off,\" he said. \"The threat level remains exactly the same as it always was, we've had many marathons here, we've looked at the experience of many, many marathons abroad.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting: Arjun Kharpal</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-marathon\">London Marathon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/athletics\">Athletics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's two fingers up to anyone who wants to try and stop us.\"</p><p>Typically, a crowd of around half a million throngs the 26.2 mile route that starts in Blackheath in south east London and ends on the Mall, and lends the event its unique atmosphere.</p><p>Among the runners will be Dr Jack Holland, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Surrey and an expert on terrorism and security policy. In a blog written in the aftermath of the bombing, he wrote: \"'Carry on' has been a prominent British response to the events in Massachusetts. And that is not a bad start. So while Boston's 26th mile was dedicated, tragically, to the victims of the Newtown shootings, many running the London Marathon on Sunday will do so with Boston in mind.\"</p><p>The elite runners also insisted that the Boston bombings would not deter them. Mo Farah, who is running the first half of the marathon in preparation for a tilt at the full distance next year, said: \"My support goes out to all the people involved, their families and loved ones. But they would want us to carry on and show our support. Why would you let it stop you?\"</p><p>The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said the extra security measures and added police numbers were to provide \"reassurance\". \"If we thought there was anything there that should stop people going out onto the streets, we would say so and we would call the whole thing off,\" he said. \"The threat level remains exactly the same as it always was, we've had many marathons here, we've looked at the experience of many, many marathons abroad.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting: Arjun Kharpal</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-marathon\">London Marathon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon bombing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/athletics\">Athletics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime\">US crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
