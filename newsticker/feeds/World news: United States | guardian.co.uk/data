A Reuters reporter observed that a nearby middle school and several homes were severely burned. </p><p>The air in town remained thick with smoke more than two hours after the explosion, and the area around the blast site was littered with shards of wood, bricks and glass. </p><p>A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused \"hundreds of casualties\" and damaged many homes. </p><p>He added that a nearby nursing home collapsed from the explosion and people were believed trapped inside. </p><p>There was no immediate official word on what sparked the explosion as emergency personnel assisted victims and doused the flames.</p><p>A Reuters reporter observed that a middle school and several homes in the area appeared to have been severely burned. </p><p>More than 100 people injured in the blast and fire were being taken to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, said the vice-president of hospital operations, David Argueta.</p><p>The Hillcrest chief executive, Glenn Robinson, told CNN that the hospital was seeing \"everything from orthopaedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss\".</p><p>A White House official said the Obama administration was aware of the situation and monitoring local and state response through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. <br /> <br />The Texas governor, Rick Perry, issued a statement saying his office had \"mobilised state resources to help local authorities\" deal with the incident.</p><p>\"It's a lot of devastation. I've never seen anything like this,\" said McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara. \"It looks like a war zone with all the debris.\" </p><p>The explosion came two days before the 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that engulfed a compound inhabited by David Koresh and his followers in the Branch Davidian sect, ending a siege by federal agents. </p><p>There were 82 members of the sect killed along with four federal agents.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas\">Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Initial tests showed them containing suspected traces of ricin but sent off for further lab tests for confirmation.</p><p>The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Daniel McMullen, said a man had been arrested on Wednesday.</p><p>Associated Press, quoting an FBI agent, separately identified the suspect as Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, of Corinth, Mississippi.</p><p>The letter to Obama was intercepted at an office away from the White House, where all mail to the president is subjected to a rigorous screening process.</p><p>The letter arrived on Tuesday, the same day that a letter addressed to US senator Roger Wicker, also thought to contain ricin, was intercepted by the mail room at the Congress. Another senator, Richard Shelby, was also the subject of an investigation after he was reported to have received a suspicious letter. </p><p>Officials said the letter to Wicker was postmarked Memphis, Tennessee. </p><p>An FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by the Associated Press quoted from the letters sent to Obama and Wicker. \"To see a wrong and not expose it is to become a silent partner to its continuance.\" Both were signed: \"I am KC and I approve this message.\"</p><p>Parts of Congress were cleared Wednesday after reports of other suspicious packages in two buildings housing the offices of senators, the Hart and Russell buildings. Emails were sent out to staff warning them to avoid the area. The warnings were backed up by loudspeaker announcements, but there was no evacuation.</p><p>The letters are reminiscent of those sent out in 2001 to members of Congress that contained anthrax spores. Five people died after coming into contact with the letters, which arrived in the week after the 9/11 attacks, although they were not connected to them.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the suspicious letters and the Boston marathon bombings. But the letters have added to the sense of uncertainty in the US in the wake of the marathon attacks.</p><p>According to the FBI, the envelope addressed to the president was immediately quarantined by secret service staff. \"A second letter containing a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin was received at an offsite mail screening facility,\" the statement said.</p><p>Initial tests for ricin can indicate false positives, and further tests were being carried out.</p><p>Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, asked why the White House would not rule out a connection between the letters and Boston, said the FBI had not made any such link. \"It is my understanding that they have not made that connection,\" he said.</p><p>\"The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement [that] they will conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is. Of course, there was another [letter] that was intercepted by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator and that also is subject  to an investigation by the FBI. The president has, of course, been briefed on these letters last night and again this morning.\"</p><p>A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure,\" it said. \"Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days.</p><p>\"Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems. Death often follows such a collapse.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

NRA-backed Republican proposals to expand concealed carry rights nationally and focus law enforcement on prosecuting gun crime were also blocked.</p><p>After the vote, Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to the senators who blocked the proposals, and the National Rifle Association. \"This is a pretty shameful day for Washington,\" he said.</p><p>In unusually forthright language, Obama said Republicans and the NRA had \"wilfully lied\" about the background check proposal. A minority of senators had decided it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives, Obama said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Newtown parents.</p><p>\"They blocked commonsense gun reform while these [Newtown] families looked on from the Senate gallery,\" he said.</p><p>Urging the public to pressure their representatives in Congress to act, Obama declared that he saw this as \"round one\" in the fight for reform. \"I believe we are going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.\"</p><p>Pam Simon, a survivor of the Tuscon shooting and a former assistant to Giffords, said she was particularly disappointed with moderate Republicans such as Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who voted against background checks but had previously voted in favour of the debate.</p><p>\"We met with Jeff, who was a friend of Gabby's,\" Simon told the Guardian. \"He has a poster in his office of Mr Smith Goes to Washington, and I would urge him to rewatch that movie and realise that it is his job to represent the people.\"</p><p>In Connecticut, state politicians voiced dismay. Democratic governor Dannel Malloy said the senators should be \"ashamed of themselves\", while state Republican house leader Lawrence Cafero said: \"I just don't understand how you could vote no.\"</p><p>However, campaigners held on to some hope that the bill may return after Senate majority leader Harry Reid also voted against the amendment in a tactical measure to allow him to reintroduce the measure at a later date. \"We have not given up hope,\" said Simon.</p><p>Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook, said: \"We return home disappointed but not defeated.\"</p><p>New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading advocate of gun control, was less optimistic. \"Today's vote is a damning indictment of the stranglehold that special interests have on Washington,\" he said. \"More than 40 US senators would rather turn their backs on the 90% of Americans who support comprehensive background checks than buck the increasingly extremist wing of the gun lobby.\"</p><p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans support moderate gun control reform. A poll in February showed 92% to 7% in favour of background checks.</p><p>Democrat sponsors of the bill agreed that amendments would need 60 votes rather than the normal 50 to pass in order to avoid a filibuster from Republicans determined to block any legislation. Ultimately, the amendment received 54 votes with 46 against, including Reid's tactical nay-vote. Four other Democrats from conservative states voted against: Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor and Heidi Heitkamp.</p><p>Four Republicans voted in favour, but, crucially, 10 others who had been in favour of at least allowing a debate on the bill withdrew their support in the 48 hours leading up to a vote.</p><p>Opposition in Congress has been bolstered by fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures\">which raised record amounts of money in the months after Newtown</a> to lobby politicians, and has threatened political retribution against any that voted for the Toomey-Manchin proposal.</p><p>The NRA welcomed the vote. \"This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,\" it said. \"As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools.\"</p><p>Even if passed, the measure would have fallen far short of the package of reforms urged by Obama in the weeks after Newtown, which including restoring a Clinton-era ban on assault weapons and limiting the size of magazine clips.</p><p>Using executive orders, Obama was able to announce a few limited measures in January, such as new funding for research into violence, but anything lasting requires breaking through Republican opposition in Congress.</p><p>Some states, such as New York and Connecticut, have tightened gun laws in the wake of Newtown, but almost as many have acted to loosen them, according to a recent Wall Street Journal study, making it hard to achieve any national solution through state legislation.</p><p>Republican opponents of expanded background checks outlined alternative proposals on Wednesday which they said would target violent criminals rather than \"hit the rights of law abiding citizens\"</p><p>This rival amendment, which would have weakened gun control by allowing concealed guns to be transferred across state lines, received more votes (52 v 48) than the background check amendment.</p><p>Pat Toomey, the Republican architect of the failed compromise, who may now face political retribution in his home state of Pennsylvania, was sanguine: \"It's not the outcome I hoped for, but the Senate has spoken and it's time to move on.\"</p><p>His proposal had sparked a fierce row between Republicans who were accused of deliberately mischaracterising the background check deal to scare voters.</p><p>Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of the bill, said: It [the bill] does not purport to create a gun registry but the only way to make expanded background checks effective is to make a registry, so the next step in the process would be to make the argument that you need a registry to make checks work.\"</p><p>\"If you sell your shotgun on Craigslist you would have to go through Federal government background checks. The consequence is it increases the burden on private citizens and the cost.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts\">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The footage was reported to show a possible suspect dropping a black bag at the location of the second bomb shortly before the blast.</p><p>Two days after the outrage, an element of confusion entered the hunt for the perpetrator of one of the worst attacks on American soil, at least in public. The day was characterised by swirling media speculation, first of a positive identification of a suspect, then of an imminent arrest, and finally of an actual arrest, which was swiftly proven to be wrong.</p><p>Denying there had been an arrest, the FBI released a statement warning the media against the \"unintended consequences\" of inaccurate reporting.</p><p>Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cautioned against expecting an early conclusion to the investigation. \"They are making progress, but it's going to take time,\" he said. \"It's going to be slow; it's going to be methodical.\"</p><p>In the absence of an arrest, and with the knowledge that those responsible for the bombing were still at large, jitters spread across Boston and through other major US cities. The federal court in south Boston was evacuated following a bomb threat.</p><p>City Hall in Oklahoma City was also briefly evacuated, and there was a surge of reports of suspicious packages in New York. In Washington there was further anxiety after the disclosure that President Obama and a Congressman had been sent letters that had initially tested positive for the poison ricin.</p><p>The third person to have died in the Boston attack was identified officially on Wednesday as Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China. Lingzi, pictured, had been watching the race with two friends when the bombs detonated, according to China's state newswire, Xinhua.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The two others who died were Martin Richard, eight, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch a friend complete the race. A further 176 spectators and runners were injured. Doctors said a number of those wounded remained on the critical list, including a five-year-old boy.</p><p>The White House said the president and the first lady would attend an inter-faith service in Boston on Thursday for the victims. The service is being called \"Healing our City\".</p><p>Despite the media swirl, there were signs of real progress on the part of the investigation into the bombing. The key video footage, according to the mayor's office, was film from a security camera located just over the road from the second bomb site at the Lord & Taylor store. \"The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,\" Dot Joyce, a spokeswoman for Menino, told the Boston Globe.</p><p>Forensic experts said they had found the lid of a pressure cooker believed to have been used to make one of the bombs on a rooftop near the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts occurred. FBI photographs indicated possible fragments of an improvised cooker bomb. The pictures show twisted parts of a metal casing, wires to a small box, a rechargeable battery, and a circuit board.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The FBI said it was likely that the explosive devices were packed with explosives and metal projectiles, such as nails, pellets and ball bearings. It is believed that the bombs were hidden inside backpacks. The photographs included images of black nylon pieces – which the FBI said may have come from one of the bags.</p><p>The fragments are being sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, where they will be painstakingly put together in an attempt to recreate the explosive device.</p><p>Intense media interest in the hunt erupted in a spate of inaccurate reports that strained relations with the FBI. The agency issued a strongly worded warning to media after it was compelled to contradict media accounts that an arrest had taken place.</p><p>Erroneous reports, the FBI statement said, could have \"unintended consequences\", and it called for the media to exercise caution. \"Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate,\" the FBI said.</p><p>CNN, the Boston Globe, Fox News, the Associated Press and the BBC were among the organisations that carried inaccurate reports that a suspect either had been arrested or that an arrest was \"imminent\".</p><p>In Washington, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the Boston bombing was not believed to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy against the US, and sought to calm fears of a greater threat when she said that though the FBI was investigating \"an act of terrorism\" there was \"no current indication to suggest that the attack was part of a larger plot\".</p><p>She said security had been tightened at Boston harbour and along the Charles river in order to protect the city from any \"Mumbai-type attack\", but stressed that was purely out of an \"abundance of caution\".</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston\">Boston</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts\">Massachusetts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security\">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington\">Ed Pilkington</a></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We take a look at those whose 'no' vote was key</p><p>The senators, Democrat and Republican, who killed the bipartisan compromise amendment on background checks for gun sales explained their opposition in terms of principle. But gun reformers will view it more as political cowardice on the part of politicians fearful of damaging their re-election chances.</p><p>The vote was on a proposal agreed between Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey that would have required criminal and mental health background checks for advertised sales of guns, including at gun shows and online.</p><p>It was the last meaningful measure left in a draft bill that had already been stripped of most of its substance.</p><p>Vice-president Joe Biden, on his way to the Hill for the vote, said: \"I hope to God that there's 60 people up there who have the courage to stand up.\" Less than an hour later he got his answer.</p><p>Here are the key votes that killed the measure, just four months after Newtown.</p><h2>Heidi Heitkamp, 57, Democrat, North Dakota</h2><p>Heitkamp has the distinction of being the first Democratic senator to break ranks by announcing publicly that she would vote against background checks.</p><p>Unlike some of her colleagues, she does not face the prospect of re-election next year, having just been elected in November. But that victory was extremely tight, with her winning by just 2,994 votes.</p><p>She has said repeatedly in interviews that guns are part of the way of life in North Dakota and her priority is the interests of her state.  One of her campaign ads set out her platform as \"schools and tractors and guns\".</p><p>In the aftermath of the Newtown shooting, she dismissed Barack Obama's proposals for gun reform as \"extreme\".</p><h2>Mark Begich, 51, Democrat, Alaska</h2><p>Begich is up for re-election next year in a state that normally votes Republican. He was one of only two Democrats to vote last week against starting a debate on gun reform.</p><p>A large part of the Democratic psyche is conditioned to believe that their disastrous losses in the 1994 congressional elections can be blamed to a large extent on Bill Clinton's assault weapons ban.</p><p>Barack Obama called Begich seeking his support, but the senator argued that what was needed is not new legislation but enforcement of existing laws. </p><p>In 2008, Begich became the first Democrat to represent Alaska in the Senate since 1980 after the long-serving Republican senator Ted Stevens was found guilty just eight days before the election of seven counts of making misleading statements. The indictment was later thrown out over prosecutorial misconduct.</p><p>Begich, who faces a tough re-election battle next year, attributed his win in part to his opposition to gun control.</p><h2>Mark Pryor, 50, Democrat, Arkansas</h2><p>Pryor was the other Democrat who voted last week against bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Although representing a traditionally red state, he won convincingly in 2002 by 54% to 46%, partly because he is an evangelical Christian.</p><p>Pryor was easily re-elected six years later when the Republicans opted against fielding a candidate. He famously said in a documentary: \"You don't need to pass an IQ test to be in the Senate\".</p><h2>Max Baucus, 71, Democrat, Montana</h2><p>Facing re-election next year, Baucus is one of the Democrats scarred by the belief that gun reform in 1994 cost the party votes. A senator for 35 years, the closest Baucus came to defeat was that year, winning by a margin of five points.</p><p>He voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban, but is this time not repeating what he would view as that mistake. He is the only Senate Democrat with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association.</p><h2>Kelly Ayotte, 44, Republican, New Hampshire</h2><p>Gun reformers rested their hopes on securing the support of Republicans such as Ayotte to offset the loss of the four Democrats. She was classified as a potential swing vote. Those hopes rose further when she was among 16 Republicans who voted last week to open the debate.</p><p>But, in a statement on Wednesday, she said: \"While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales.\"</p><h2>Lisa Murkowski, 55, Republican, Alaska</h2><p>Like Ayotte, she is one of the few Republicans the gun-reformers hoped might be persuadable. But she announced on Tuesday night she was resisting all attempts to win her round and would vote against expanded background checks.</p><p>Unlike others who had been sitting on the fence but eventually voted against, she is in a relatively strong position electorally. Her popularity in Alaska was confirmed in 2010 when she lost a Republican primary to the Tea Party-backed Joe Miller but won re-election with a write-in campaign.</p><p>Manchin and Toomey altered their plan to try to win her over, putting in an exception to background checks for those living in remote areas far from gun stores.</p><p>It failed to sway her. In a statement, Murkowski wrote that Alaskans \"want to keep Americans safe as much as anyone, but don't believe they need to compromise their second amendment rights to get there\".</p><h2>Dean Heller, 52, Republican, Nevada</h2><p>Heller announced on Tuesday he would vote against the amendment.</p><p>\"Despite the good faith efforts of senators Manchin and Toomey, the onerous paperwork and expansion of federal power mandated in this legislation are too great of a concern. I believe that this legislation could lead to the creation of a national gun registry and puts additional burdens on law-abiding citizens,\" he said.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress\">US Congress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republicans</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill\">Ewen MacAskill</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That's why it was so easy for people to jump on to reports that a Saudi national had been a person of interest.  There is no reason for why he was a suspect, other than he was a Saudi Arabian.</p><p>\"Whether they are being questioned, interrogated, having their apartments being searched – we are looking at a community where it's normal for the NYPD or the FBI to simply knock on your door and ask you questions without a warrant.\"</p><p>Awad said that the anxiety that the Muslim community is feeling over a possible backlash is not new, but has been present since 9/11. It is waiting to see what will happen now, he said. \"A lot of people are holding their breath.\"</p><p>Boston's largest mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, has asked police to guard its campus in the wake of the marathon attacks, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/boston-mosque_n_3093919.html\">according to a report in the Huffington Post</a>.</p><p>Awad cited Erik Rush, a conservative columnist and Fox News guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyCafee/status/324617448991109120/photo/1\">who tweeted</a> \"Muslims are evil.

Rush later claimed he was being sarcastic.</p><p>In the US, the number of FBI-designated hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs rose dramatically after the September 11 attacks, which were carried out by mostly Saudi members of al-Qaida.</p><p>Faiza Patel, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice, said: \"You can't get away from the fact that the last attack was carried out by mostly Saudi nationals. But from what I have seen and heard, the official response this time has been restrained. There were a lot of statements coming in from Muslim communities clearly disavowing the attacks. That is important.\"</p><p>Patel said that, based on FBI data, Muslims are three times more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than other citizens.</p><p>Sahar Aziz, a fellow of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), agreed that the government response has been careful in the aftermath of the Boston attacks.</p><p>Aziz, who is also an associate professor of law at Texas Wesleyan school of law, said: \"Compared to past events, the government has been judicious in making public what they know and don't know, and warning people not to jump to conclusions about the racial identification of suspects.\"</p><p>However, he warned that the US should guard against falling pray to scape goating of any racial or religious communities from the far right.</p><p>\"There is a cadre of pundits on the far right spreading fear and paranoia that it is inevitably going to be a Muslim. They will want to trigger a backlash, will engage in racial and religious scapegoating. They won't incite people to violence because they know it is a crime, but they may do everything short of it. All Americans should be on guard not to allow our country to fall pray to that.</p><p>\"The real question for the Muslim community is what will happen if it does turn out that the suspect is Muslim. What we hope is that Americans can speak to their values that guilt should not be imposed on others who share the same faith.\"</p><p>Christine Warner, the campaign director for Shoulder to Shoulder, a campaign to end anti-Muslim sentiment, said she was monitoring any potential backlash. Warner said she had been \"generally encouraged\" by the reporting, with the exception of the reporting of a Saudi national as a person of interest and comments reported on Wednesday by CNN of a \"dark skinned male\" being a suspect in the case. </p><p>\"This gives us no indication of where the investigation is going and is of concern to us,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.timwise.org/2013/04/terrorism-and-privilege-understanding-the-power-of-whiteness/\">In a blogpost on his website</a>, anti-racism writer Tim Wise wrote: \"White privilege is knowing that if you are a white student from Nebraska – as opposed to, say, a student from Saudi Arabia – that no one, and I mean no one, would think it important to detain and question you in the wake of a bombing such as the one at the Boston Marathon.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam\">Islam</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion\">Religion</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/karenmcveigh\">Karen McVeigh</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

CNN continued to stick by the story long after the FBI had said on record that the report was \"inaccurate\".</p><p>It prompted the FBI to issue a statement on the reporting of the investigation: \"Contrary to widespread reporting, there have been no arrests made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that have been inaccurate. </p><p>\"Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.\"</p><p>The latest round of false reports follows initial reporting from the New York Post on Monday that claimed that 12 people had died in the double blast, and that police had identified a Saudi man as a suspect. In fact, three people died, and claims of a Saudi man was being held were dismissed by Boston police commissioner Edward Davis.</p><p>There were also inaccurate reports on Monday night that police had found and dismantled a number of unexploded bombs, with the Wall Street Journal quoting sources claiming five devices in total.</p><p>The main culprit in Wednesday's misreporting appeared to be CNN. Based on unnamed \"sources\", the network first claimed that a significant breakthrough in the case had been made.</p><p>It later upgraded this to being an actual arrest in the case. Fox News sent out a tweet saying that it, too, had confirmed that an arrest had been made.</p><p>The Associated Press sent out a series of reports based on unnamed sources during a 90-minute period. First AP reported that an arrest was \"imminent\", citing a \"law enforcement official\". It then said the suspect was in custody and on his way to the federal court.</p><p>The Boston Globe went so far as to say that the suspect was being taken to the US district court in south Boston.</p><p>The reports of an arrest, however, flew in the face of the official line being put out.</p><p>While CNN continued to stick with the \"arrest\" line, the Guardian was repeatedly told on record by the FBI that the story was false. In a series of phone calls to the FBI's national office, a spokeswoman confirmed that \"no arrests had been made\".</p><p>The Guardian was not alone. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/324586306518802433\">Pete Williams of NBC News repeatedly pointed out</a> that his sources were telling him that not only had no arrest been made, but that a suspect had yet to be identified.</p><p>The Boston police department eventually used its official Twitter feed to say the reports of an arrest were not true. The office of prosecutor Carmen Ortiz did likewise.</p><p>Embarrassingly for CNN, one of its own pundits, the former FBI assistant director Tom Fuentes, contradicted the story live on air, telling viewers that three sources, including two senior officials close to the investigation, had told him categorically that no arrest had been made.</p><p>Eventually, the network backtracked and acknowledged there had been no arrest. The CNN website blamed the mistake on a \"misunderstanding among officials\".</p><p>It said that the confusion centred on a Boston law enforcement official telling CNN \"we got him\", but not specifying whether if that meant that authorities had identified a suspect, or arrested one.</p><p>But the network said it would not apologise to viewers, with a spokesperson telling Michael Calderone of the Huffington Post: \"CNN had three credible sources on both local and federal levels. Based on this information we reported our findings. As soon as our sources came to us with new information we adjusted our reporting.\"</p><p>It is not the first time that CNN has been forced to backtrack on breaking news. Reporting the supreme court verdict on Obama's healthcare reforms, it wrongly reported that the individual mandate part of the legislation had been struck down. The mistake was later blamed on a producer who had jumped the gun.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions\">Boston Marathon explosions</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi\">FBI</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/boston-globe\">Boston Globe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/cnn\">CNN</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc\">BBC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/associated-press\">Associated Press</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television\">US television</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams\">Matt Williams</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They are his constituents and many were present in the chamber.</p><p>He's young – the youngest sitting senator, actually – and an early Obama supporter, given to occasional bouts of (understandably) overwrought emotional rhetoric. During his very first floor speech as a senator last week, which itself took on gun legislation, he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/11/sandy-hook-gun-bill-senate_n_3060848.html\">read the names</a> of the Newtown victims – and some of the 3,000 other victims of gun violence since 14 December – into the congressional record.</p><p>Murphy's also been a vocal, unusually sharp critic of the National Rifle Association. He <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/12/21/newtown_congressman_calls_nra_statement_revolting/\">described</a> their response to the the Newtown tragedy – the \"National School Shield\" Program – as \"unhinged\", \"revolting\", and \"tone deaf\", <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-murphy-vs-nra-gun-control-violence-newtown-2013-3#ixzz2QkFSIzOZ\">declaring</a> himself \"flabbergasted\" by the group's press conference and calling out the program for what it was: a bald ploy for further political power.</p><blockquote><p>\"This was a chance for the country to come together. The NRA made the decision to gain membership by ginning up fear and becoming even more radical.\"</p></blockquote><p>But on Wednesday, Murphy eschewed the inflammatory, easy route of shaming gun rights extremists (though I have no qualms about that path myself). Maybe because the battle was already lost, his speech had a tone of exasperated regret, tinged with earnest bewilderment. He was forthright about what a vote against universal background checks means:</p><blockquote><p>\"You are basically saying you are OK with more criminals getting guns.\"</p></blockquote><p>(This sentiment has been <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnstanton/manchin-criminals-dont-like-background-check-measure?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">echoed</a> by the amendment's Democratic co-author, Joe Manchin.) Murphy then took a step back from his focus on the NRA as the bill's primary antagonist and articulated the question so many of us have: <em>90%</em> of Americans support the kind of background checks laid out in the Manchin-Toomey legislation. Why isn't it passing? Sure, he said, it's tempting to lay blame entirely on the NRA:</p><blockquote><p>\"For a while, I could only explain opposition to near-universal background checks through the power of the gun lobby because I just thought that people must know in their heart that a simple, easy thing to do is to make sure that criminals don't own guns, and so there must be some external pressure that's forcing people to do the wrong thing.\"</p></blockquote><p>But, he continued:</p><blockquote><p>\"The longer that I've spent in this place, the more I'm convinced that there are people who actually do believe that we should just go back to the days of the wild, wild west, that we should usher in a new era of gun control Darwinism in which the good guys have guns, the bad guys have guns, and we just hope that the good guys shoot the bad guys. The gun lobby, frankly, tells us this. We should probably listen to them.\"</p></blockquote><p>Murphy is being either disingenuous or overly self-effacing with that crack about \"the longer I've spent in this place\": he's been in the Senate for four months. If anything, he brings the clarity of a newcomer to the debate and I think he's right: we <em>can't</em> explain the failure of Congress to enact meaningful gun legislation by simply pointing to the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/17/gun-spending/\">economic</a> power of the NRA.</p><p>There's something just as seductive about <em>their narrative</em>. We need to listen to that narrative if we have any hope of effectively untangling it.</p><p>Money can buy votes but it can't buy an explanation for those vote. The senators voting \"no\" today have to believe that there is a way of talking about \"gun rights\" as though it isn't an embarrassing anachronism, a misreading of the constitution as grievously damaging to the country as the similarly \"strict constitutionalist\" notion that brought us the \"separate but equal\" decision in Plessy v Ferguson, the 1896 landmark supreme court decision upholding segregation. </p><p>If anything, thinking of the NRA – and the political power of gun rights activists as a whole – as the sole architect of the failure of the background check amendment gives us exactly the kind of convenient, one-dimensional \"good guy v bad guy\" framework that the NRA wants to superimpose on every decision about gun legislation. The fact is that if gun violence was a matter of keeping guns away from \"bad guys\", we could probably have some success at it.</p><p>When gun rights advocates tell us that the real problem isn't guns, but a culture of violence, they are half-right – or maybe, just have it backwards. The problem is guns <em>in</em> a culture of violence … or at least, in a culture that still believes that violence can be addressed with violence.</p><p>Since Newtown, I have re-examined my own feelings about guns and the second amendment. I grew up in Nebraska; my family is from Texas. I learned to shoot a rifle in grade school, and took target-shooting classes at summer camp. I don't know a lot about guns beyond that – just enough to know how much fun, and how dangerous, they are.</p><p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, it's hard to have any affinity for Texas and Texans without some belief in the idea that the federal government may at some point turn against you. I also read a lot of apocalyptic science fiction: I use the specter of the zombie plague as motivation when I don't want to go to the gym. All that is to say, I am sympathetic to the notion that I may need to handle a gun some day. Just as I know I may also need to know how to distill my own urine for drinking water.</p><p>In light of all the gun violence we have seen in recent months, I have come to believe that in the very worst scenario – the US becoming a dystopian dictatorship with food riots, total censorship, zombies and Sarah Palin – it is the latter that has a better chance of saving my life and less likelihood of getting me killed. Seriously, if the lights go out, and we return to a state of nature, I want to be able to band together with allies, not succumb myself to paranoia and violence. I also think I could take a zombie out with an ax better than with a gun. (The available zombie eradication literature suggests this is the preferred method.)</p><p>As for the non-zombie dystopian possible future: I can imagine an armed resistance against tyranny, I like to think I would want to be a part of it. I am not sure that guns, precisely, would be the most effective method of disruption. There is also always the danger that using violence to overthrow an unjust ruler makes it more difficult to establish which side is really on the side of justice.</p><p>The founders were probably not thinking about zombies when they fashioned the second amendment; they had a real and legitimate fear about the threat of tyranny to their fledgling experiment in democracy. Two centuries on, that democracy has proved remarkably enduring, stable and resilient; and citizens have not had to take up arms against arbitrary authority to preserve it. Can democracy ever, in fact, flourish from the barrel of a gun? </p><p>There is a horrible symmetry to the gun legislation debate taking place in the Senate under the pall cast by the Boston Marathon bombings. As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655\">Patton Oswalt's viral essay argued</a>, the lesson we must – if we are to retain our dignity and humanity – take away from that tragedy is that people banded together can do great things in the face of evil. The good guys do always win. And the good guys do not need guns to do so.</p><p>But, as Murphy acknowledged on the floor of the Senate, we have trouble believing that. Or at least, our elected representatives do.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control\">US gun control</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime\">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate\">US Senate</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democrats</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/connecticut\">Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties\">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting\">Newtown shooting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra\">NRA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-political-lobbying\">US political lobbying</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 1995 the Ogoni Nine were tortured and hanged by the Nigerian military junta.</p><p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) said it was \"deeply troubled by the supreme court's decision to undercut 30 years of jurisprudence to limit US courts' ability to hear cases on human rights violations committed outside the United States\".</p><p>\"The US with this case is withdrawing from the world from the path that international law has taken,\" said Peter Weiss, vice-president of the CCR, said. He said it was \"in the national interest\" for the US to promote human rights around the world.</p><p>Peter Rees, Shell's legal director, said: \"In our view, the court has reached the right decision. Shell remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business, and I want to make clear that we deny, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case. Today's decision doesn't weaken the human rights of people around the world; it makes it clear that the Alien Tort Statute does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the US which have nothing to do with the US.</p><p>\"But we've always maintained this case has nothing to do with the United States. The Alien Tort Statute is an 18th Century law designed for an entirely different purpose and certainly not for application where there is no connection with the United States. We appreciate the opportunity to have been heard in this case, and we are pleased that the court has now clarified this area of the law.\"</p><p>The US Chamber of Commerce praised the decision. \"The US supreme court's decision today ensures that trial lawyers cannot continue to use the American judicial system to expose global businesses to frivolous and costly lawsuits,\" said president Thomas Donohue. \"Today's decision helps to ensure that America will continue to be an attractive place to do business and removes barriers for companies looking to do business throughout the world.\"</p><p>The ATS has been a popular vehicle for human rights cases since 1980 when Joelito Filártiga, son of a Paraguayan opposition figure who was tortured and killed by Paraguayan police, sued his father's torturer in the US courts. Filártiga was denied justice at home but sued in the US when he learned his father's torturer was living in New York.  A US court held that torturers, like pirates, had become \"hostis humani generis\" – enemies of all mankind.</p><p>Marco Simons, legal director of EarthRights, a human rights nonprofit,  said the ruling left many questions unanswered. EarthRights is currently leading a case against banana giant Chiquita Brands for allegedly funding terrorists in Columbia. As a US company Simons said the new ruling would not affect the case Chiquita.</p><p>\"It's clear in other areas of the law that any foreign company doing business in the US has to abide by US standards. For the ATS there is now a two tier system,\" he said.

On Sunday rebels in the strife-torn country denied any link. But a six-month visit to Russia last year is now being scrutinised to see if Tsarnaev did visit any other countries in the North Caucuses region.</p><p>Michael McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that the FBI had questions to answer.</p><p>\"He was interviewed by the FBI in 2011 and let go. He travelled back to Russia and spent six months there,\" McCaul said.</p><p>On return he immediately posted jihadist videos on YouTube, the Republican lawmaker said. \"Clearly something happened in that six-month timeframe.

On Sunday rebels in the strife-torn country denied any link. But a six-month visit to Russia last year is now being scrutinised to see if Tsarnaev did visit any other countries in the North Caucuses region.</p><p>Michael McCaul, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that the FBI had questions to answer.</p><p>\"He was interviewed by the FBI in 2011 and let go. He travelled back to Russia and spent six months there,\" McCaul said.</p><p>On return he immediately posted jihadist videos on YouTube, the Republican lawmaker said. \"Clearly something happened in that six-month timeframe. He radicalised at some point.\"</p><p>McCaul said he wanted to know why no flags were raised on Tsarnaev that would have helped officials track his movements.</p><p>Meanwhile it was reported Sunday that a hold was placed on a citizenship request by the 26-year-old as a result of the FBI's former interest in him.</p><p>An article in the New York Times claimed officials at the Department of Homeland Security decided not to grant his application after a routine background check uncovered the 2011 interview by agents.</p><p>The FBI has not said publicly who requested that they look into the activities of the elder brother, but it has been widely reported that it was the Russian government.</p><p>In a statement late Friday, the agency admitted interviewing Tamerlan and other family members.</p><p>\"The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic of foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011,\" it said.</p><p>But on Sunday, the agency was accused of having \"dropped the ball\" regarding the older Tsarnaev brother.</p><p>\"The FBI missed a lot of things is one potential answer, or laws do not allow the FBI to follow up in a sound, solid way,\" senator Lindsey Graham told CNN's State of the Union.</p><p>Meanwhile fellow Republican Peter King, chairman of the House subcommittee on counterterrorism, blasted the FBI for alleged failings in the case.</p><p>\"This is the firth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\" he told Fox News Sunday, going on to cite the cases of al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, Little Rock shooter Carlos Bledsoe, the accused Fort Hood killer Nidal Malik and alleged American-Pakistani terrorist David Coleman Headley.</p><p>\"This is the latest in a series of cases like this … where the FBI is given information about someone as being a potential terrorist.

The other was a skateboarding dope smoker. A complex picture is emerging of the Boston bombers<br /><br /><a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/04/21/guBoston01.jpg\" title=\"\">Infographic: how the manhunt unfolded</a></p><p>The behaviour of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston marathon bombing, was not what might have been expected from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-mit-police-dead-watertown\" title=\"\">America's most wanted man</a>, nor from a jihadi determined to perish fighting the United States.</p><p>For the first three days of last week, the 19-year-old attended the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth, where he was studying. He worked out at the gym, and on the Wednesday night he slept in his room. According to friends, he attended a party with friends from his football team. \"He was just relaxed,\" one witness said.</p><p>A day later, his elder brother, Tamerlan, 26, who on Friday would die from the wounds sustained in a gun battle with police, was also not keeping the lowest of profiles. The brothers' uncle Ruslan Tsarni, 42 – who called them \"losers\" who had failed to fit in – told the media that, on the night before he was killed, Tamerlan had called Ruslan's older brother, the boys' father. \"He said to my brother the usual rubbish, talking about God again, that whatever wrong he had done on his behalf, he would like to be forgiven,\" adding, \"I guess he knew what he had done.\"</p><p>Within 24 hours of that call, the two young men, ethnic Chechens born in Dagestan who had spent the last decade in the US, were being hunted through Boston, with the whole city ordered to take shelter behind closed doors after they had been identified by video from security cameras as they apparently planted their bombs.</p><p>Their behaviour in the period between the detonation of the bombs, which killed three people and injured almost 200 more, and the denouement of the hunt that led to Dzhokhar's capture – hiding wounded in a boat in a backyard – seems as baffling as the motives for their attack in the first place.</p><p>For while Tamerlan – in some respects at least – appears to have fitted the profile of an alienated young man who had drifted towards an ever-more fundamentalist version of Islam, his skateboarding, dope-smoking younger brother seemed the antithesis of that image. It is this that has led many analysts already to suggest that the actions of the Tsarnaev brothers has more in common with alienated and unhappy \"school shooters\" – caught up in their own narcissistic drama – than typical Islamist extremists.</p><p>One acquaintance of Dzhokhar – known to friends as \"Jahar\" – who emailed the <a href=\"http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/\" title=\"\">blog of well-known US commentator Andrew Sullivan</a>, speculated he had fallen under his brother's influence. \"I graduated a year before … Jahar, and while I wasn't very close with him, I knew him fairly well. While it seems like every time this happens people say I can't believe this happened, this truly is a case where the personality and the behaviour don't seem to match up. Jahar was quiet, but fairly social. He came to parties, smoked weed with me and many of my friends and was always cheerful.</p><p>\"My feeling is that the reason that Jahar was involved has entirely to do with his brother ... Given that his brother essentially raised him, I think this is an awful case of evil being perpetuated because of the trust and love Jahar had for his brother.\"</p><p>The Twitter account of Dzhokhar over the last few months provides, if not clues to his mindset, at least some suggestions. He was growing tired of America and missed Dagestan. In January he wrote: \"I don't argue with fools who say Islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.\"</p><p>Those who trained with Tamerlan, a talented young boxer known to them as \"Tom\", seemed as surprised as his brother's friends were that he had emerged as prime suspect in the  bombing.</p><p>\"In the ring, he could knock a man out with one punch,'' Gene McCarthy, founder of the Somerville Boxing Club, told the Boston Globe. \"But when he sat at a piano, he could play classical music like you wouldn't believe.

All the while a helicopter buzzed overhead equipped with infrared technology to detect what the teenager was doing underneath the tarpaulin; hostage negotiators were used to persuade him that he was in need of urgent medical attention.

The other was a skateboarding dope smoker. A complex picture is emerging of the Boston bombers<br /><br /><a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/04/21/guBoston01.jpg\" title=\"\">Infographic: how the manhunt unfolded</a></p><p>The behaviour of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston marathon bombing, was not what might have been expected from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/19/boston-mit-police-dead-watertown\" title=\"\">America's most wanted man</a>, nor from a jihadi determined to perish fighting the United States.</p><p>For the first three days of last week, the 19-year-old attended the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth, where he was studying. He worked out at the gym, and on the Wednesday night he slept in his room. According to friends, he attended a party with friends from his football team. \"He was just relaxed,\" one witness said.</p><p>A day later, his elder brother, Tamerlan, 26, who on Friday would die from the wounds sustained in a gun battle with police, was also not keeping the lowest of profiles. The brothers' uncle Ruslan Tsarni, 42 – who called them \"losers\" who had failed to fit in – told the media that, on the night before he was killed, Tamerlan had called Ruslan's older brother, the boys' father. \"He said to my brother the usual rubbish, talking about God again, that whatever wrong he had done on his behalf, he would like to be forgiven,\" adding, \"I guess he knew what he had done.\"</p><p>Within 24 hours of that call, the two young men, ethnic Chechens born in Dagestan who had spent the last decade in the US, were being hunted through Boston, with the whole city ordered to take shelter behind closed doors after they had been identified by video from security cameras as they apparently planted their bombs.</p><p>Their behaviour in the period between the detonation of the bombs, which killed three people and injured almost 200 more, and the denouement of the hunt that led to Dzhokhar's capture – hiding wounded in a boat in a backyard – seems as baffling as the motives for their attack in the first place.</p><p>For while Tamerlan – in some respects at least – appears to have fitted the profile of an alienated young man who had drifted towards an ever-more fundamentalist version of Islam, his skateboarding, dope-smoking younger brother seemed the antithesis of that image. It is this that has led many analysts already to suggest that the actions of the Tsarnaev brothers has more in common with alienated and unhappy \"school shooters\" – caught up in their own narcissistic drama – than typical Islamist extremists.</p><p>One acquaintance of Dzhokhar – known to friends as \"Jahar\" – who emailed the <a href=\"http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/\" title=\"\">blog of well-known US commentator Andrew Sullivan</a>, speculated he had fallen under his brother's influence. \"I graduated a year before … Jahar, and while I wasn't very close with him, I knew him fairly well. While it seems like every time this happens people say I can't believe this happened, this truly is a case where the personality and the behaviour don't seem to match up. Jahar was quiet, but fairly social. He came to parties, smoked weed with me and many of my friends and was always cheerful.</p><p>\"My feeling is that the reason that Jahar was involved has entirely to do with his brother ... Given that his brother essentially raised him, I think this is an awful case of evil being perpetuated because of the trust and love Jahar had for his brother.\"</p><p>The Twitter account of Dzhokhar over the last few months provides, if not clues to his mindset, at least some suggestions. He was growing tired of America and missed Dagestan. In January he wrote: \"I don't argue with fools who say Islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.\"</p><p>Those who trained with Tamerlan, a talented young boxer known to them as \"Tom\", seemed as surprised as his brother's friends were that he had emerged as prime suspect in the  bombing.</p><p>\"In the ring, he could knock a man out with one punch,'' Gene McCarthy, founder of the Somerville Boxing Club, told the Boston Globe. \"But when he sat at a piano, he could play classical music like you wouldn't believe. The Tom I knew was a sweetheart.''</p><p>That Tamerlan changed in recent years is clear. \"He was not devout, practising. But about three years ago he began praying five times a day,\" his aunt <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/04/19/maret_tsarnaeva_dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_tamerlan_tsarnaev_s_aunt_still_not.html\" title=\"\">Maret Tsarnaeva</a> told CNN.</p><p>And although Tamerlan had once embraced life in the US, even hoping to box for his adopted country at one stage, more recently he had seemed unhappy in America.</p><p>\"I don't have a single American friend.

But that hasn't stopped them speculating. In retrospect, from the testimony of those who knew him, there were signs. But nobody could have predicted anything on this scale. What influences came to bear? What motives could there be? What would drive a young man to wilfully murder as many innocents as possible, leaving the country both vulnerable and mournful?</p><p>I pose these questions not of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\" title=\"\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a>, the 19-year-old chief surviving suspect in the Boston bombing saga that left three dead and injured more than 170 last week, but of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/nyregion/adam-lanza-an-enigma-who-is-now-identified-as-a-mass-killer.html\" title=\"\">Adam Lanza</a>, who shot 20 children and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut in December. The contradictions in the political responses to the two tragedies and the issues they raise could not be more glaring or obscene.</p><p>On Monday the Boston Marathon was bombed. Within a day of suspects being identified, politicians who defended the status quo on guns were calling for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/04/20/peter_king_calls_for_increased_surveillance_of_muslims_after_boston/\" title=\"\">\"increased surveillance of Muslims\"</a> and addressing <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/04/sen_grassley_in_judiciary_committee_conflates_immigration_regulation_with_boston_violence.html\" title=\"\">\"loopholes in the immigration system\"</a> (Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a firefight, grew up in Kyrgyzstan).</p><p>On Wednesday the Senate declined to pass even the most anaemic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/senate-debates-gun-control-package-live\" title=\"\">gun control measures</a> in response to the Newtown shootings. Twenty children, aged between six and seven, are slaughtered in school and the American polity takes five months to decide do nothing. Unable to break the filibuster limit, it didn't even come to a vote. Hiding behind the National Rifle Association's (NRA) talking points, gun rights senators cloaked themselves in the constitution, insisting support for gun control would violate the second amendment \"right to bear arms\".</p><p>While the authorities <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/20/boston-marathon-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-mirnada-rights\" title=\"\">denied the still unconscious Dzhokhar his Miranda rights</a> (informing him that he has the right to remain silent), some Republicans insisted he be tried as \"an enemy combatant\" – the legal aberration and moral abomination that paved the way to Guantánamo Bay. Their devotion to constitutional rights, it turns out, is partial; their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/americas-deadly-devotion-guns\" title=\"\">embrace of guns</a> is complete. <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2011/why-nra-opposes-gun-control-supporters%60.aspx?s=&st=&ps\" title=\"\">The NRA even opposes legislation banning gun sales to people on the terrorist watchlist</a>, meaning those who can't board a flight can still lock and load.</p><p>As John Oliver, a UK comedian on the Daily Show, noted: \"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb and we all have to take off our shoes at the airport. Thirty one school shootings since Columbine and no change in the regulation of guns.\"</p><p>The ramifications of this neglect cannot be overstated. More than 85 people – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/09/usa.usgunviolence\" title=\"\">including eight children</a> – are killed with guns on an average day in America and more than twice that number are injured. Even taking into account the fact that most gun deaths are suicides, that's still several times the death toll of 9/11 every year.</p><p>Numbers alone, however, don't quite do the cognitive dissonance justice. The effect of a terrorist attack such as Boston cannot be measured in the number of slain alone. Terrorism creates a culture of fear and suspicion that spreads beyond those immediately affected and impacts upon our understanding of risk. It means no one feels safe, anyone is a potential suspect and danger could be anywhere. \"Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack,\" writes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai\" title=\"\">Arjun Appadurai</a> in Fear of Small Numbers. \"Terror … opens the possibility that anyone may be a soldier in disguise, a sleeper among us, waiting to strike at the heart of our social slumber.\"</p><p>The trouble is this is precisely the culture that many Americans have lived in for years. It's estimated that in Chicago <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060612/12mavericks.htm\" title=\"\">20-30% of the children have witnessed a school shooting</a>. Carolyn Murray, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/12/barack-obama-gun-violence-chicago\" title=\"\">whose son was shot dead on his grandmother's lawn in a Chicago suburb</a>, does not enjoy much in the way of \"social slumber\".

But that hasn't stopped them speculating. In retrospect, from the testimony of those who knew him, there were signs. But nobody could have predicted anything on this scale. What influences came to bear? What motives could there be? What would drive a young man to wilfully murder as many innocents as possible, leaving the country both vulnerable and mournful?</p><p>I pose these questions not of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/dzhokhar-tsarnaev\" title=\"\">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a>, the 19-year-old chief surviving suspect in the Boston bombing saga that left three dead and injured more than 170 last week, but of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/nyregion/adam-lanza-an-enigma-who-is-now-identified-as-a-mass-killer.html\" title=\"\">Adam Lanza</a>, who shot 20 children and six teachers in Newtown, Connecticut in December. The contradictions in the political responses to the two tragedies and the issues they raise could not be more glaring or obscene.</p><p>On Monday the Boston Marathon was bombed. Within a day of suspects being identified, politicians who defended the status quo on guns were calling for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/04/20/peter_king_calls_for_increased_surveillance_of_muslims_after_boston/\" title=\"\">\"increased surveillance of Muslims\"</a> and addressing <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/04/sen_grassley_in_judiciary_committee_conflates_immigration_regulation_with_boston_violence.html\" title=\"\">\"loopholes in the immigration system\"</a> (Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a firefight, grew up in Kyrgyzstan).</p><p>On Wednesday the Senate declined to pass even the most anaemic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/senate-debates-gun-control-package-live\" title=\"\">gun control measures</a> in response to the Newtown shootings. Twenty children, aged between six and seven, are slaughtered in school and the American polity takes five months to decide do nothing. Unable to break the filibuster limit, it didn't even come to a vote. Hiding behind the National Rifle Association's (NRA) talking points, gun rights senators cloaked themselves in the constitution, insisting support for gun control would violate the second amendment \"right to bear arms\".</p><p>While the authorities <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/20/boston-marathon-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-mirnada-rights\" title=\"\">denied the still unconscious Dzhokhar his Miranda rights</a> (informing him that he has the right to remain silent), some Republicans insisted he be tried as \"an enemy combatant\" – the legal aberration and moral abomination that paved the way to Guantánamo Bay. Their devotion to constitutional rights, it turns out, is partial; their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/americas-deadly-devotion-guns\" title=\"\">embrace of guns</a> is complete. <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2011/why-nra-opposes-gun-control-supporters%60.aspx?s=&st=&ps\" title=\"\">The NRA even opposes legislation banning gun sales to people on the terrorist watchlist</a>, meaning those who can't board a flight can still lock and load.</p><p>As John Oliver, a UK comedian on the Daily Show, noted: \"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb and we all have to take off our shoes at the airport. Thirty one school shootings since Columbine and no change in the regulation of guns.\"</p><p>The ramifications of this neglect cannot be overstated. More than 85 people – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/09/usa.usgunviolence\" title=\"\">including eight children</a> – are killed with guns on an average day in America and more than twice that number are injured. Even taking into account the fact that most gun deaths are suicides, that's still several times the death toll of 9/11 every year.</p><p>Numbers alone, however, don't quite do the cognitive dissonance justice. The effect of a terrorist attack such as Boston cannot be measured in the number of slain alone. Terrorism creates a culture of fear and suspicion that spreads beyond those immediately affected and impacts upon our understanding of risk. It means no one feels safe, anyone is a potential suspect and danger could be anywhere. \"Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack,\" writes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjun_Appadurai\" title=\"\">Arjun Appadurai</a> in Fear of Small Numbers. \"Terror … opens the possibility that anyone may be a soldier in disguise, a sleeper among us, waiting to strike at the heart of our social slumber.\"</p><p>The trouble is this is precisely the culture that many Americans have lived in for years. It's estimated that in Chicago <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060612/12mavericks.htm\" title=\"\">20-30% of the children have witnessed a school shooting</a>. Carolyn Murray, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/12/barack-obama-gun-violence-chicago\" title=\"\">whose son was shot dead on his grandmother's lawn in a Chicago suburb</a>, does not enjoy much in the way of \"social slumber\". She has become so accustomed to gunfire at the weekends she could call the police and tell them what calibre was used and the direction of the shooting, just by listening in bed. Put bluntly, a significant section of America lives in constant terror and Congress just decided they should continue to do so.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/169083/aurora-another-mass-killing-shocks-america-why#\" title=\"\">hierarchy of suffering and security in America</a> there are, in short, places where you are supposed to be safe – marathons, suburban schools, cinemas – and places where you are apparently entitled to no such expectation: particularly poor black and Latino neighbourhoods.

He was captured on Friday night, a day after a violent gun battle with police that left his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, dead.</p><p>Boston mayor Tom Menino told This Week on ABC that he was so seriously ill that agents might never be able to interrogate him. \"We don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,\" he said.</p><p>Dan Coats, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC: \"The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat. It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a condition where we can't get any information from him at all.\"</p><h2>FBI 'dropped the ball'</h2><p>As the FBI waited to question Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, it faced intense scrutiny over its prior contacts with his brother. One congressman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/21/fbi-tamerlan-tsarnaev-questioning\">accused the FBI of having \"dropped the ball\"</a>.</p><p>The bureau admitted that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in early 2011 at the request of a foreign government, believed to be Russia, which had concerns he was linked to Islamist terrorism. The FBI said it concluded he was not involved in terrorism, and was left scrambling at the weekend to find out more about a six-month visit he made to Russia in 2012.</p><p>There was also concern on Sunday about how federal investigators would deal with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev if he recovers sufficiently to be questioned and tried. He was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any information he provided before being read his rights would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger.</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda rights by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/20/boston-suspect-miranda-rights-activists\">civil rights advocates expressed concern</a> about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\".</p><p>That was not a concern for some political figures, who claim there is enough evidence against Tsarnaev to outweigh the advantages of reading him his Miranda rights. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, described \"chilling\" surveillance video from the Boston Marathon bombings which showed the younger brother at the heart of the attacks. The film shows him dropping his backpack and calmly waking away before the bomb exploded, Patrick said.</p><p>\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\" Patrick said on NBC. \"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\" Patrick conceded that he had not viewed all the tapes but had been briefed about them by law enforcement officials.</p><p>More details emerged at the weekend of the suspects' race to evade capture. As the authorities closed in on Thursday night in the Watertown area, the Tsarnaev brothers are accused of killing an officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police, severely wounding a Boston transit officer and engaging in a frenzied car chase and shootout during which they bombarded officers with explosives, including a pressure-cooker bomb.</p><p>The chief of Watertown police, Edward Deveau, said officers attempted to tackle Tamerlan Tsanaev when he ran out of ammunition, but had to take cover as his younger brother drove a carjacked Mercedes at them. The SUV dragged Tamerlan's body down the block, he said. The suspect was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Meanwhile Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escapted on foot. He was eventually captured late on Friday night after a resident discovered a bloody trail leading to a boat in his backyard. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where security was tight on Sunday.</p><p>As authorities guarded Tsarnaev, attention turned a trip to Russia in 2012 by his older brother. His family has claimed Tamerlan Tsarnaev went to Dagestan to visit his father, but an aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, told the Guardian on Sunday that he arrived in the area before his father. She said Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the United States in January 2012 and arrived in Dagestan around March. His father, Anzor Tsarnaev, only arrived in the republic in May. \"He came to become acquainted with [Dagestan],\" Suleimanova said. \"He would sit at home and pray. He was learning to read the Qur'an. He saw relatives, friends.\"</p><p>She hinted that times had become tough for the brothers after their father left the United States for Dagestan, followed a couple of months later by their mother, Zuneidat. Anzor Tsarnaev had bought a ticket for the United States for 16 April, she said, because the brothers were having money problems. \"He would send money from here when he could,\" she said.</p><p>US officials are investigating whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev built links with Dagestani rebels, fighting a heavy police state in order to build an Islamist caliphate along Russia's southern flank. Dagestan's main rebel group denied any links with the attack in a statement released on Sunday. </p><h2>'His views aren't mainstream'</h2><p>The FBI was criticised on Sunday for failing to follow up on Tsarnaev after its contacts in 2011. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina, told CNN's State of the Nation: \"The ball was dropped in one of two ways. The FBI missed a lot of things.\"</p><p>Republican Peter King, chairman of the House subcommittee on counterterrorism, was also critical. \"This is the firth case I'm aware of where the FBI has failed to stop someone,\" he told Fox News Sunday, citing the cases of al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, Little Rock shooter Carlos Bledsoe, the accused Fort Hood killer Nidal Malik and alleged American-Pakistani terrorist David Coleman Headley.</p><p>The New York Times reported on Sunday that a hold was placed on a citizenship request by the 26-year-old as a result of the FBI's former interest in him. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security decided not to grant his application after a routine background check uncovered the 2011 interview by agents, the report said.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been asked to leave a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three months ago, after he interrupted a prayer service to argue with the imam, who had referred to Martin Luther King Jr. A member of the mosque present at the service told the LA Times that Tsarnaev shouted: \"You cannot mention this guy because he's not a Muslim!\"</p><p>Imam Suhaib Webb, of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the city's largest mosque, said in an interview that he had recently heard of the incident. \"That's a sign right there that his views aren't mainstream,\" Webb said.</p><p>Bostonians gathered to remember the victims on Sunday. A few blocks from where the bombs exploded less than a week ago, hundreds packed into the Church of the Covenant in Boston. The church had thrown open its doors to worshippers from the city's Old South Church, located in the police area still closed off to the public, and most of the pews were full as the service began.</p><p>The scale of the bombings was immediately apparent as around half the congregation responded to a request from Rev Dr Jim Antal, president of the Massachusetts United Church of Christ, to raise their hands they were near the explosions or knew someone who was. \"Now raise your hand if you have visited or spoken with someone who was injured,\" Antal said. Dozens of people had.</p><p>A few miles north-west of Boston, in Medford, the family and friends of Krystle Campbell, 29, one of three spectators killed by the attacks on the Boston Marathon, held a wake for her on Sunday. The two others killed were Martin Richard, eight, of the Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston, and Lu Lingzi, 23, a Boston University graduate student from China.

He was captured on Friday night, a day after a violent gun battle with police that left his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, dead.</p><p>Boston mayor Tom Menino told This Week on ABC that he was so seriously ill that agents might never be able to interrogate him. \"We don't know if we'll ever be able to question the individual,\" he said.</p><p>Dan Coats, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC: \"The information that we have is that there was a shot to the throat. It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a condition where we can't get any information from him at all.\"</p><h2>FBI 'dropped the ball'</h2><p>As the FBI waited to question Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, it faced intense scrutiny over its prior contacts with his brother. One congressman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/21/fbi-tamerlan-tsarnaev-questioning\">accused the FBI of having \"dropped the ball\"</a>.</p><p>The bureau admitted that it interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in early 2011 at the request of a foreign government, believed to be Russia, which had concerns he was linked to Islamist terrorism. The FBI said it concluded he was not involved in terrorism, and was left scrambling at the weekend to find out more about a six-month visit he made to Russia in 2012.</p><p>There was also concern on Sunday about how federal investigators would deal with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev if he recovers sufficiently to be questioned and tried. He was not read his Miranda rights, the process under US law that would have informed him of his right to remain silent, when he was detained. Ordinarily that would mean that any information he provided before being read his rights would be inadmissible at trial, but Carmen Ortiz, US attorney for Massachusetts, cited a public safety exception that is intended to prevent the public from immediate danger.</p><p>An expansion of the public safety exception to Miranda rights by the Obama administration is the subject of controversy, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/20/boston-suspect-miranda-rights-activists\">civil rights advocates expressed concern</a> about how it would be applied. The American Civil Liberties Union said the exemptions should not be \"open-ended\" and that America \"must not waiver from our tried and true justice system\".</p><p>That was not a concern for some political figures, who claim there is enough evidence against Tsarnaev to outweigh the advantages of reading him his Miranda rights. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, described \"chilling\" surveillance video from the Boston Marathon bombings which showed the younger brother at the heart of the attacks. The film shows him dropping his backpack and calmly waking away before the bomb exploded, Patrick said.</p><p>\"It does seem to be pretty clear that this suspect took the backpack off, put it down, did not react when the first explosion went off and then moved away from the backpack in time for the second explosion,\" Patrick said on NBC. \"It's pretty clear about his involvement and pretty chilling, frankly.\" Patrick conceded that he had not viewed all the tapes but had been briefed about them by law enforcement officials.</p><p>More details emerged at the weekend of the suspects' race to evade capture.

But John Kerry, the US secretary of state, announced only a doubling of non-lethal aid, including equipment such as body armour and night-vision goggles but not weapons. America's $250m will be distributed by the Supreme Military Council, part of an effort to guarantee firmer political control by the Free Syrian Army.</p><p>Khatib, a former imam of the Ummayyad mosque in Damascus, is highly regarded inside Syria. His departure is a blow to an opposition which often appears fractured and incoherent and pits liberal and secular figures against the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. He <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/24/moaz-al-khatib-resignation-syrian-opposition\" title=\"\">first announced his resignation on 24 March</a>, but continued working in the hope of securing wider representation and internal reforms. Khatib met Kerry before Saturday's conference began.</p><p>\"The result in Istanbul was less than the Syrian people expected,\" Hisham Marwa, a senior member of the NOC, said. \"The US said that the use of chemical weapons was a red line for the Assad regime but the regime is using them and nothing has happened. We expected more. Russia sends Assad tonnes of weapons every week.\"</p><p>Saudi Arabia, which has been accelerating arms supplies to the rebels through Jordan in recent weeks, was also unhappy with the outcome of the Istanbul meeting, opposition sources said. Opposition supporters inside and outside Syria say that providing the FSA with anti-aircraft missiles could quickly turn the tide by robbing Syria's air force of its ability to attack with impunity. But Assad's government has successfully  exploited mounting western concerns about the rise of Jabhat al-Nusra, an important Islamist fighting group.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/john-kerry\">John Kerry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianblack\">Ian Black</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But John Kerry, the US secretary of state, announced only a doubling of non-lethal aid, including equipment such as body armour and night-vision goggles but not weapons. America's $250m will be distributed by the Supreme Military Council, part of an effort to guarantee firmer political control by the Free Syrian Army.</p><p>Khatib, a former imam of the Ummayyad mosque in Damascus, is highly regarded inside Syria. His departure is a blow to an opposition which often appears fractured and incoherent and pits liberal and secular figures against the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. He <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/24/moaz-al-khatib-resignation-syrian-opposition\" title=\"\">first announced his resignation on 24 March</a>, but continued working in the hope of securing wider representation and internal reforms. Khatib met Kerry before Saturday's conference began.</p><p>\"The result in Istanbul was less than the Syrian people expected,\" Hisham Marwa, a senior member of the NOC, said. \"The US said that the use of chemical weapons was a red line for the Assad regime but the regime is using them and nothing has happened. We expected more. Russia sends Assad tonnes of weapons every week.\"</p><p>Saudi Arabia, which has been accelerating arms supplies to the rebels through Jordan in recent weeks, was also unhappy with the outcome of the Istanbul meeting, opposition sources said. Opposition supporters inside and outside Syria say that providing the FSA with anti-aircraft missiles could quickly turn the tide by robbing Syria's air force of its ability to attack with impunity. But Assad's government has successfully  exploited mounting western concerns about the rise of Jabhat al-Nusra, an important Islamist fighting group.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria\">Syria</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">United States</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast\">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/john-kerry\">John Kerry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianblack\">Ian Black</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
