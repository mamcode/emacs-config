Ferguson, who felt that his team had stood up like champions, suggested that the referee, Lee Probert, was not strong enough, but his West Ham counterpart, Sam Allardyce, also tore into the officials.</p><p>Television replays showed that Robin van Persie was in an offside position when Shinji Kagawa's 77th-minute shot hit both posts before breaking for the striker to score United's second equaliser of the evening. The assistant referee Harry Lennard did not flag. Allardyce said that West Ham had been robbed of a \"famous victory\" and in the row over Carroll's challenge on De Gea, he took issue with Ferguson.</p><p>\"It was a red card, there is no doubt about that,\" Ferguson said. \"The referee did see it but he didn't see it as a red card. We know how West Ham play, it's ball-in-the-air most of the time and you've got to defend those things. They are very, very aggressive as we've seen tonight. You hope there's a strong referee. I'm not so sure we got that tonight.</p><p>\"We had to stand up to a lot there but we kept going, our players, down twice, came back . They played like champions. They were magnificent in terms of determination and courage to play, so I was pleased with the result.\"</p><p>Allardyce was not. \"Can I get my anger out first?\" he said. \"This was a famous victory for us and when we play like that and score one of the best goals of the season [through Mohamed Diamé] ... the job of the assistant referee is to give the decision. Van Persie is two yards offside.</p><p>\"He has taken a famous victory from us. To draw this game by default is a bitter pill to swallow. We were outstanding. If my players make those mistakes, they get dropped, so should they. Our fans [should] go home with 41 points, knowing that we are safe. There is £60m, £70m, £80m riding on it.</p><p>\"This level of football has to be equalled by the level of the officials. [Lennard's] coaches have to coach him properly and coach him into getting better – that is why they are professional these days.\"</p><p>Carroll said that he had gone for the ball in the collision that left De Gea poleaxed. \"I was running straight in and I couldn't stop at that moment,\" he said. Allardyce backed him up, with a nod towards the stopping distances in the Highway Code.</p><p>\"As you'll know from your code, when you are travelling at 60mph, it takes 300 yards to stop,\" he said. \"When Andy is travelling at 15mph, he can't stop. I don't agree [with Ferguson]. It was a yellow at worst. You can't commit for a header and then suddenly stop. We're just bitterly disappointed with the result, although it's another precious point against the team who are going to be champions.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chilean, who has coached at Real Madrid and enjoyed a successful spell with Villarreal, took Málaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League this term despite continuing financial problems at the Spanish club, before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/09/borussia-dortmund-malaga-champions-league\" title=\"\">they lost to Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p><p>The 59-year-old speaks good English and is renowned as a disciplinarian who has implemented a brand of attractive, attacking football. His contract with Málaga expires at the end of next season but includes a buy-out clause believed to be set at around £3.4m, though it remains to be seen whether he can be persuaded to swap Spain for Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Chelsea, who appointed Benítez on a seven-month contract to succeed Roberto Di Matteo, intend to make a formal offer to their preferred candidate only once it is clear whether they have qualified for the Champions League. They are sounding out potential managers, with Pellegrini high on their shortlist.</p><p>José Mourinho is another possibility and has made clear his desire to return to London if, as expected, he leaves Real Madrid in the summer. David Moyes, whose contract at Everton expires in June, and the Atlético Madrid coach, Diego Simeone, have also made an impression, while Gianfranco Zola's progress at Watford has been noted even if these remain early&nbsp;days in the Italian's managerial career.</p><p>Benítez's hopes of leaving Chelsea with Champions League football were boosted by a first away success in the league since mid-January, the recalled John Terry scoring twice to defeat Fulham and remind the interim manager of his qualities. Regardless, the former England captain is likely to return to the bench for Sunday's trip to Liverpool. \"The important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"Every player wants to play every game, but they have to realise they can't do that and be 100% in each game.</p><p>\"As for the Champions League, I said a long time ago that the race for the top four would go until the end for the season. It'll be like this and I don't think any of the clubs up there, including Everton, is out of it. Things can change with every game. We have to keep winning our games and keep going.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/malaga\">Málaga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/laligafootball\">La Liga</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They also remember precisely what they said. On 14 May 1995, a spring's afternoon at Upton Park and Andy Cole, confronted by Ludek Miklosko, has the last-gasp chance to win the Premier League title for United. \"Just lift it, Andy,\" they shouted. Or words to that effect. But Cole hits it low at Miklosko, who saves. United draw and Blackburn Rovers are the champions.</p><p>That was when title races were title races, when they went to the wire or, at the very least, made it into May. United's canter to their 20th championship has been a very different story, one that has been marked by a remarkable absence of stress. The demons of Upton Park will always gnaw away at Sir Alex Ferguson but when they threatened to reappear here, after West Ham United scored wonderful goals, United swatted them away. The truth was that even a defeat would hardly have mattered.</p><p>United have come to trade in extreme end-of-season luxuries. Their target now is not only to win but to do so in historic style and despite these dropped points, they could still better Chelsea's record 95 points from 2004-05. When they stand to be crowned is also on the agenda. It could be on Sunday week at Arsenal, which would be particularly sweet for Robin van Persie. United roll on, remorselessly.</p><p>West Ham have enjoyed their own sort of comfort this season. The script for newly promoted teams, particularly those that wriggle up via the play-offs, calls for frayed nerves and regular dips in and out of the relegation plunge pool. But West Ham, perhaps surprisingly for a club with a recent addiction to chaos, have remained above the relegation battle, barely once being mentioned as candidates to slip down.</p><p>Allardyce merits credit for overseeing the steadiness. Before the play-off final against Blackpool at the end of his first season in charge, there had been the genuine feeling among the West Ham support that he should be sacked if the team lost. But he got the job done and these days he has the fans' acceptance, at the very least, if not their outright love for his style.</p><p>If many of his players fit a particular profile, they are certainly united behind him. They talk glowingly of his attention to detail and it was evident in his set-up here, in a tactical duel that he would have relished against his hero Ferguson. He pushed Mohamed Diamé and Kevin Nolan high on to United's defensive midfielders, Phil Jones and Michael Carrick, and his team carried the fight. Allardyce has made West Ham competitive.</p><p>United expected an aerial bombardment and balls up to Andy Carroll were a feature of the West Ham strategy. The tall striker put it about with Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and, shudderingly so, David De Gea.</p><p>Ferguson jabbed his finger as he advanced his protest to the fourth official, Andre Marriner, after De Gea had been cleaned out by Carroll following a 45th-minute corner.</p><p>The home team's finesse, though, was apparent, whether in Carroll's early threaded shot that kissed the outside of the far post or the sight of Ricardo Vaz Te tricking outrageously out of a tight spot inside his own area. Their opening goal was not bad, when they broke from the edge of their box. There was the drive of Diamé; a stop-start move from Matt Jarvis to flummox Ferdinand; Carroll's aerial power and Vaz Te's anticipation. And the second, from Diamé's left-footed curler, was a peach.</p><p>Carroll's future is a pressing issue for West Ham and his all-action display provided further evidence as to why. His willingness to battle against the hardest centre-halfs not only endears him to supporters. His team-mates relish the out-ball to him and his hold-up work allows them to squeeze up the pitch. His loan from Liverpool expires at the end of the season and Allardyce has suggested that his wage demands, allied to financial fair play, could make it impossible to make the move permanent.</p><p>And what of Allardyce, who has still to sign his contract extension? The club maintain that there will be no problems, that it is merely a matter of time and yet it has dragged and Allardyce says that he has to be sure of his ability to compete in the summer transfer market before he commits. There has also been the notion that he has wanted to wait until West Ham have 40 points. That could happen here on Saturday against Wigan.</p><p>United's focus was formidable. It has sustained them this season and on each occasion that they fell behind their response bristled with conviction. Shinji Kagawa's balance to tee up Antonio Valencia's goal was beautiful and the second equaliser had been extensively trailed, even if Van Persie might have been marginally offside before he struck his 25th of the season. There was no dramatic finale for United. The job had been done.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It goes without saying that one club will drop points.</p><p>Ramsey, though, is focused on what Arsenal have to do and he says that if they can win at Fulham on Saturday, to end a key week with seven points from an available nine, they would be in a commanding position. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/13/arsenal-norwich-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal beat Norwich City at home last Saturday</a> and the draw against Everton extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to five matches.</p><p>\"It was important for us not to lose against Everton and we still have a lot of confidence,\" Ramsey said. \"We were quite nervous in the first half and our final ball let us down but, overall, we were quite solid. We're looking forward to the weekend. Tottenham and Chelsea still have to play each other. They still have tough games. The teams are still going to drop points so we're positive and confident that we can finish in the top four.</p><p>\"We always knew that this week was going to be a big week for us and hopefully now we can finish it off strongly and get a win at Fulham. That would put us in a really strong position.\"</p><p>Ramsey has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks and it is no coincidence that he is back to playing in central midfield. \"I'm delighted with the way I'm playing and how the team is playing,\" he said. \"It makes a big difference [being in central midfield]. That's my position and that's where I want to play.</p><p>\"At the beginning of the season, I was moving all over the pitch, playing left-wing, right-wing, right-back. I was asked to do a job in many positions, which I'm happy to do for the team. If the manager wants me to play there, I'm not going to say no to that. But I've got my place back in the middle and my performances have been showing what I'm capable of doing there.\"</p><p>The Football Association will take no action following the fracas between Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Everton's Kevin Mirallas on Tuesday. The pair clashed in the tunnel at half-time but the governing body is satisfied that it was nothing serious.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal\">Arsenal</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Wenger complained that the referee, Neil Swarbrick, had failed to dismiss Darron Gibson for a series of fouls in a fractious first half, and claimed the Merseysiders had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/arsenal-arsene-wenger-everton\" title=\"\">gone \"over the edge\" throughout</a> with their challenges in seeking to snuff out Arsenal's threat.</p><p>Asked if Everton had been particularly keen to unnerve their hosts, Baines said: \"It was not something that we'd spoken about. Wherever we go, the team we're up against know that they will be in for a game against us. The workrate the players put in is there to be seen. We are not a side people enjoy playing against at any level: we have a little bit about the team. We have workrate and ethic, and the togetherness and team spirit are inspirational at times.</p><p>\"Sometimes I look around and I can't believe what some people are doing, the effort they are putting in, people going above and beyond and playing with injuries. It is inspirational to see how hard they work. Mixed with the quality we have and show, we can't be an easy team to play against. This game was very bitty and scrappy in the first half, with both sides conceding fouls and giving the ball away, but I don't think they can have any complaints about the physical side of it. I don't think there was anything [over the top] in the whole game.\"</p><p>The draw left Everton four points from Arsenal and still chasing Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea for the last two Champions League places. \"We are definitely the outsiders,\" added the England defender. \"The other sides are teams who people would back to beat us to those positions, but we won't give up on it. We will keep trying to win games. We go to Sunderland and then have a home game [against Fulham], and if we can get six points from the next two games let's see what everyone else does. We can try and keep up the pressure, keep winning and keep ourselves in the mix. You never know. We might just nick it.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton\">Everton</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I have lost count how many games I used to go with him on a Tuesday night against some team, [with Dad] pulling me to the side, leaving 10 minutes before the end, and saying we would never go back.\"</p><p>\"Then on the Saturday we would be there again. For him to see that [promotion party], and for his son to play a part in that, makes it even more special. It hit home to me a little bit as well. He said he will die a happy man.\"</p><p>With Cardiff joining Swansea in the Premier League – the first time Wales has had two top-flight clubs – <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/blog/2013/apr/17/cardiff-city-promotion-premier-league-swansea\" title=\"\">Bellamy predicted there will be wider benefits</a> for the capital city and the country as a whole. \"The knock-on effect it can have on the national team, for young players coming through, this makes it so much more special as well,\" he said. \"We've seen what it has done for Swansea, we have seen what it has done for the city and the money it has brought in as well. We are the capital city, we are Cardiff City. What it will do for us will be immense and the knock-on effect it will have for Welsh football will only be positive.\"</p><p>Bellamy hailed Malky Mackay's contribution as manager as \"immense\" and said that, combined with the backing of the club's Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan, Cardiff have the perfect platform to achieve further success. \"Malky has really pushed us forward with his professionalism. Financially this club is going to grow and with him at the helm it will allow us to do it in the right manner. Hopefully there will be no limit to what he can succeed.\"</p><p>Asked about Cardiff's chances in the Premier League, Bellamy said: \"It is going to be a completely different stage. Are we going to sign players? I don't know. I've got to look after myself as well, so I hope we don't sign too many players, especially on the left wing. I don't think we need players there! No, of course we do. We need strength in depth everywhere but that is between the manager and owner.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/craig-bellamy\">Craig Bellamy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chelsea have thrust their way back into the Premier League's top three, eclipsing Fulham at a canter with players whose days at the club appear to be numbered thriving in the familiarity of a derby. Those crammed into the Putney End will have found reassurance in the sight of Frank Lampard and, in particular, John Terry excelling. This was a throwback, a saunter to enjoy on the banks of the Thames.</p><p>Both the veterans had sat out Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, a watershed given the significance of that occasion and the reality they have been permanent fixtures on the bigger stages when fit. The sheer weight of games has forced each into Rafael Benítez's policy of rotation though Lampard, his contract drifting to its conclusion, and Terry have started to feel more second-string than first-choice.</p><p>The 60th game of Chelsea's season offered a reminder of their qualities. When the team sought strength they rallied, albeit against opponents too wasteful to inflict their own wounds. A first away win in the league since mid-January was timely given the fixture clutter.</p><p>Lampard oozed calm authority on his 600th appearance for the club, even if he still seeks the two goals to equal Bobby Tambling's club record of 202. It was Terry who registered twice here, a header in either half puncturing Fulham's resistance, the captain ending the contest bare-chested and celebrating in front of the away support. \"I'm really pleased with his performance, but the most important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"They all know that. The players have to be ready to perform and on their toes every game.\" With Gary Cahill close to a return from a knee injury, Terry's alternate selections may well be prolonged but, regardless, he can make his mark on the run-in.</p><p>Benítez had required his captain's strong-arm presence here. The reality is Chelsea had needed a spark to ignite what had initially been another understandably leggy display. Fulham had created the early opportunities, Dimitar Berbatov orchestrating their play, with the visitors limited to flurries of possession before David Luiz tired of all the pretty approach-play. He collected the ball some 30 yards out and with Bryan Ruiz too half-hearted in his attempt to close him down, lashed a shot which caught the wind gusting around the arena and careered beyond Mark Schwarzer into the top corner.</p><p>It was a staggering goal to pep the visitors' resolve. Half-time was close when Lampard belted a free-kick from distance and tapped into the same flight path, the ball swerving in mid-air and thudding into Schwarzer's chest before dribbling behind. Fulham never recovered their composure from the resultant corner, Juan Mata eventually floating a deep cross to the far post where Terry leapt unchallengedbetween Sascha Riether and Philippe Senderos to power a header into the net.</p><p>That lead was never likely to be properly challenged thereafter, Chelsea's composure established. For all Fulham's huff and puff, there was little surprise when the revitalised Fernando Torres flicked on a corner and Terry, from virtually on the goal-line, nodded in a second 19 minutes from time.</p><p>Fulham stewed in their frustration. They are not used to yielding to their local rivals so readily in this arena, with this a first defeat in four years, though the exasperation was born more of an inability to take their own chances. Martin Jol's side had forged the clearer opportunities when the game was goalless only to be blunted by profligacy.</p><p>The tone had been set in the opening attack Riether – a player Jol hopes to secure on a long-term basis from Cologne in the summer after an excellent season on loan – crossing beyond David Luiz only for Ruiz, alone in front of goal, to poke an awkward volley over the bar.

That was until the 83rd minute when Aleksandar Kolarov fed Carlos Tevez whose finish from 20 yards came as a right-foot bullet which the visiting goalkeeper, Joel Robles, found impossible to stop.</p><p>That signalled the end of this phase of Wigan Athletic's relegation-dodging escape act that had previously yielded seven points from three games. As Manchester United drew at Upton Park, Tevez's winner made it a productive night for City – Roberto Mancini having previously stated their mission is to confirm second place and reduce the deficit to United.</p><p>City are now 13 points behind with a game in hand. For Mancini, this prompted a joke about Robin van Persie's contested late equaliser at West Ham. \"If they didn't score an offside probably we were nine [points behind if they win their extra game],\" he said.</p><p>There was a more mixed message for the returning Micah Richards whose serious knee injury had kept him out since 27 October. \"I'm happy because he came back to play but I thought that he was in better form because he trained and because we know true Richards,\" Mancini said. \"For this reason I think that he needs to work a lot. He played for 10 minutes, after [that] he went down because it's normal after six months. It's impossible he can play well for 70 minutes.\"</p><p>Wigan are now three points adrift of Aston Villa, Stoke City and Sunderland though they have also played one fewer match. \"I see it going down to the final game, we are playing Aston Villa,\" Roberto Martínez said. \"We talk about six pointers and it does not get bigger than that. That is something we would be happy about from where we came from but we have a lot of games before that.\"</p><p>City's recent displays in beating United and knocking Chelsea out of the FA Cup to reach the final had been evidence of a late-season return to form. Here, they took a while to wake from a soporific opening until the scoreboard flashed up that United had gone 1-0 down.</p><p>Suddenly Yaya Touré could be spied marauding through the middle, then Richards surged into space down the right but had strayed offside.</p><p>Next up, Sergio Agüero, playing to the left of the City trident behind the lone striker Tevez, made life awkward for Emmerson Boyce and Paul Scharner and flipped over a cross that was unlucky not to be met by a team-mate.</p><p>City, though, had to bless their fortune as Wigan, in their most convincing passage of play, pinned them back and in front of Joe Hart's goal Kolarov had to be alert to make a skied clearance that could have gone anywhere.</p><p>Next Arouna Koné's touch failed him when he had only Hart to beat – and the keeper then had to throw out his arms and legs in a star jump to save from Franco Di Santo after some slick footwork created an opening. Moments later Richards was forced to upend the same player as Di Santo looked to split the defence and the right-back was booked. To the relief of the home fans Wigan's free-kick was hit over the wall by the impressive Shaun Maloney and straight into Hart's hands.</p><p>Agüero, who scored the clinching goal in the 2-1 win over Chelsea at Wembley, did not emerge for the second half and was replaced by Edin Dzeko in a City reshuffle that switched to a three-man defence. If Mancini was hoping this new formation would galvanise his team he had to watch when, with hart beaten, Joleon Lescott positioned himself superbly to clear off the line from Maloney.</p><p>Just before the hour the Italian changed his personnel again. Javi García came off for James Milner as his manager reverted to his original back four, with Samir Nasri switching to the left wing and the England amidfielder taking his place on the right.</p><p>Sensing someone should wrest the initiative, Tevez blazed wide with only Robles to beat. While there were further chances for each side but no goals until the striker's pivotal intervention.</p><p>Mancini, who rested Gaël Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta and Matija Nastasic, believes Wigan will survive. \"They don't deserve to be relegated,\" he said. \"For 60 minutes they played better than us.\"</p><p>He and Martínez had perhaps been correct to suggest that no implications could be drawn from the contest regarding the Cup final. But, if it is as entertaining as this one, 11 May should be an invigorating occasion.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiejackson\">Jamie Jackson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sir Alex Ferguson's men twice had to come from behind but this is the resilience that is taking them to their 20th league championship and, in that context, they will not mind too much that their late, dramatic search for a winner could not concoct a decisive goal.</p><p>The damage is only superficial when a team have their advantage at the top of the league and, though the gap is trimmed to 13 points to Manchester City, everything still points to the game at Arsenal on Sunday week as the moment when they can confirm the handover. For Robin van Persie, the scorer of their 77th-minute equaliser, it must be a sweet prospect.</p><p>Van Persie had been offside for his goal and Sam Allardyce lamented at some length afterwards about the injustice his team has suffered. West Ham United took the lead in the 17th minute when Ricardo Vaz&nbsp;Tê finished a move that had begun on the edge of their own penalty area and the goal from Mohamed Diamé, 10 minutes into the second half, was one of the outstanding moments Upton Park has witnessed this season. In between, Antonio Valencia had scored his first goal of the season but the champions-elect had looked flat for long spells, with Wayne Rooney enduring a difficult and undistinguished night, and it was only after Van Persie's goal that West Ham suddenly looked vulnerable. Allardyce can complain too often about match officials but on this occasion he had a point.</p><p>The West Ham manager was not alone, though, in harbouring a few grievances, Ferguson arguing that Andy Carroll deserved an \"obvious red card\" for the flying leap into David de Gea that poleaxed the goalkeeper in the first half. Carroll had been a difficult opponent for the league leaders, particularly in the opening hour, when it was not just his size that the opposition defence found awkward to handle but his movement and ability to bring others into the game.</p><p>He was booked in the second half for a far more innocuous tussle with De Gea but the way the Spaniard handled the earlier battering was another reflection of United's durability this season. De Gea may not have suffered a more crashing challenge since arriving in England, even going back to those periods when opposition teams would routinely try to rough him up. Yet the Spaniard is no soft touch these days and it was telling how Ferguson's players did not feel it necessary to back him up when he gave a little back in the second half. De Gea can fight his own battles now.</p><p>Ferguson, however, was entitled to object and it was difficult afterwards to know which manager was the most annoyed. Both had legitimate grievances but Allardyce was right to say the lack of offside against Van Persie had the greater consequences. Kagawa's shot had flicked off James Collins and ricocheted off one post to the other. Van Persie turned in the loose ball, putting away a finish that was probably harder than he made it look, but it was an unmistakably bad call from the assistant referee. Allardyce described it as an \"easy&nbsp;decision\".</p><p>West Ham had to repel some concerted pressure for the remainder of the match, Ferguson's players passing the ball with greater speed and penetration. Yet the lingering memory will be what happened in the 55thminute after Vaz Tê and Guy&nbsp;Demel worked a little passing triangle with Diamé near the right-hand corner of the penalty area. The turn from Diamé to&nbsp;spin away from Rooney was wonderful in its own right. The curling left-foot shot, struck with equal measures of power and&nbsp;precision, made it a goal of sumptuous quality.</p><p>Vaz Tê's goal had not been too shabby either. This time, Rooney misplaced a pass on the edge of West Ham's penalty area. Diamé carried the ball forward then played it to the left for Matt Jarvis. Rio Ferdinand was turned far too easily and, when the cross was chipped up to the far post, Carroll had a clear height advantage over Patrice Evra. Vaz Tê had anticipated that Carroll's effort might come his way and applied the decisive touch with a stooping header. Rooney, unwittingly involved in both West Ham goals, looked forlorn when he was substituted and will remember the occasion with little fondness.</p><p>Ferguson's men had flickered only sporadically before an equaliser that was classy in its creation. Van Persie's pass sent Kagawa running through the inside-left channel. Winston Reid dived in too impulsively and Kagawa dropped his shoulder, turned to the byline then played the ball across the goalmouth to precisely where Valencia wanted it. From two yards, Valencia could hardly miss.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danieltaylor\">Daniel Taylor</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The last train to Manchester from Euston is at 9pm and the final train to Wigan from the same station departs at 8.31pm.</p><p>On Wednesday night the FA released a statement declaring that 5.15pm is \"a regular kick-off time in the football calendar\" and insisted that the majority of fans would use official coaches, run by the competition sponsor National Express, to attend the match. However, supporters say the claim that a small proportion will be travelling by train to London is \"absolute rubbish\" and that the FA's attitude leaves a \"sour taste\".</p><p>Kevin Parker, secretary of the Manchester City Supporters Club, said: \"Not only does it show that they don't care but it shows that they don't know. From where they're coming from in their offices in Soho or their hotels, a 5.15pm kick-off is no problem. But the reality is that a number of fans will be travelling by train and wanted to catch a train home at a sensible time.</p><p>\"What's going to happen now is that people have booked tickets for a 9pm train, the last that City fans can catch, and some of them might not get to see the end of the game – God forbid if it goes to extra time. I don't see any reason at all why this game couldn't have kicked off earlier.</p><p>\"The coaches are going to be in demand because they are all coming from the north west of England. It's unbelievably bad planning. Fans will work round it because that's what they do, but it's not going to be easy, it's going to be financially more difficult. It leaves a sour taste, you always look for the opportunity for the FA to get something right these days and they don't.\"</p><p>Asked if the FA's claim that a small percentage of fans will be travelling by train was correct, Parker added: \"That's absolute rubbish. Most people I know wouldn't dream of driving to London and almost all are catching the train.\"</p><p>Wigan and City met in the Premier League on Wednesday night, hours after the FA released a statement that has compounded an already controversial situation.</p><p>\"The FA would like to highlight that 5.15pm is a regular kick-off time in the football calendar,\" it said. \"This time was agreed with major stakeholders and broadcasters and has been used across the game for a number of years for televised matches. In terms of transportation, a small percentage of Cup final fans use the method of train travel.\"</p><p>Jason Taylor, spokesman for the Wigan Athletic Supporters Club, said: \"The FA don't think about stuff like young children of four or six years old potentially not getting home till 2am if they are travelling by coach. These people aren't going to be getting home till very, very late.</p><p>\"We're in the FA Cup final and we'll do whatever we can do get down there – the FA know that they've got us cornered. There's not many people coming down on the train, because we can't.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa\">The FA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup\">FA Cup</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Aston Villa captain, who was diagnosed with the disease in March last year, has undergone intensive bouts of chemotherapy treatment and is now in remission.</p><p>\"It was a very, very long year but now, after all this treatment, I can go back to a normal life,\" said Petrov, who paid a visit to Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground this week. \"I have finished all of the high intensity treatment and from now on I'll be on the softer treatment, which is two years on tablets. I can start doing things that I couldn't do in the last year. I can take the kids to school, I can come here [to the training ground], I can start doing a bit of work and losing a little bit of weight.\"</p><p>Petrov said that he thought he was suffering from \"just a cold, nothing serious\" before he was diagnosed. \"While the treatment was going on I was surprised how long things were dragging on, it kept dragging and I kept thinking: 'When is this going to finish?' But with a lot of patience and a lot of support from family and friends and everybody I managed to pull through. I had my hard moments but I had good moments as well. I can say I'm lucky because some people with this disease will die very quickly and I managed to keep battling and still be here, still standing. It's really good, that's a great thing.\"</p><p>The 33-year-old paid tribute to the players and staff at Villa and in particular the supporters, who have applauded in the 19th minute of every match, in recognition of Petrov's squad number. \"I don't know how I can thank the fans because it's been incredible,\" the Bulgaria international said. \"Sometimes I have a joke with some friends when they text me saying: 'You've still got that applause in the 19th minute, when are they going to stop?!' But it's been incredible.</p><p>\"I've got a great wife, a strong, great wife and she's been unbelievable, incredible in this journey. The kids as well, my mum and dad, my brother, my wife's mum, they've all been so strong and close beside me. To have support every single day from people who have their own problems and their own life but they keep finding the time to send you a message or call you, it's just unbelievable.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It had been mooted that the Football League would deem a deduction on an already relegated club to be no punishment at all, but it intends to implement the sanction during the current campaign once Portsmouth exit administration, which they expect to do this week.</p><p>\"We feel that although the punishment hasn't technically been activated yet, its effects have certainly been felt from day one of this season,\" said PST's Colin Farmery. \"We feel that we've served the punishment and that it has had an effect on our season, so the points ought to come off now.</p><p>\"We knew that they were going to come off – although we started the season on zero points, mentally everyone started on -10 points. If you are told that you will lose 10 points at some point during the season, you never budget for those points. If you look at it like that then we have been punished.</p><p>\"If we were to end up with a 10-point deduction next season it would feel like we are being punished twice for the same offence. We certainly feel that as a football club we can look in the eyes of a supporter from any other club and say we have been punished for the sins of others considerably over the last three years. We were in the Premier League and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/15/chelsea-portsmouth-fa-cup-final\" title=\"\">FA Cup final</a> – we've suffered three relegations and had 29 points taken off us.\"</p><p>Ashley Brown, the PST chairman, had previously said it would be \"devastating\" if the 10-point sanction was imposed next season, with Portsmouth's future now finally appearing stable despite a second successive relegation.</p><p>Pompey were playing in the Premier League three years ago and won the FA Cup in 2008, but have slid down the divisions due to catastrophic financial mismanagement by a number of owners. However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/10/portsmouth-future-fratton-park-ownership\" title=\"\">following an 11th-hour deal struck at the high court last week regarding the valuation of Fratton Park</a>, PST will&nbsp;become 51% shareholders under a new structure.</p><p>Once they exit administration Portsmouth are expected to appoint a new chief executive and confirm that the caretaker manager, Guy Whittingham, will take up the post on a full-time basis.</p><p>Farmery added: \"The really big challenge is about to begin and that's a really exciting. Everyone's been resigned to League Two football since January and the fact that we knew we were going to lose 10 points as well really put the tin lid on it. As a club we've played at this level in the past and while we feel we should be playing in a higher division because of our status, we're in the division we deserve to be in.</p><p>\"Once we come out of administration we can start functioning as a normal football club again. We've got a number of players on loans or short-term contracts and the ones that our new management team want to keep we should be able to provide the resources for.</p><p>\"We've been a pretty sick club for three or four years now but we've ended this season well and there is confidence that we can take into next year. We have a medium-to-long-term plan to get back into the Championship.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leagueonefootball\">League One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-finances\">Finances</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league\">Football League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cardiff City's long overdue promotion to the Premier League means that Welsh football, for the first time ever, will be home to two top-flight clubs next season, with Malky Mackay's side going toe-to-toe with Swansea City on the biggest stage.</p><p>How we would have laughed at that prospect a little while ago. Cardiff and Swansea have been through everything from winding up orders to administration, and for a snapshot of just how bleak their plight was in the not too distant past, the 1997-98 fourth-tier league table takes some beating. Five places off the bottom, in 88th position on the league ladder, were Swansea, just behind Darlington, Rochdale and Hartlepool. As for Cardiff, they were one rung lower, in 89th place. To give a guide as to the level of interest at that time, when the two clubs met at Ninian Park in 1997 the attendance was 6,459.</p><p>How times have changed. Decrepit old grounds have been replaced with all-seater stadiums that will be sold out almost without fail next season.</p><p>Swansea, who won the League Cup in February and remain on course for a top-10 finish in the Premier League, have already outgrown their new home and this week submitted plans to increase the capacity from 22,500 to 33,000, to cope with the increased demand.</p><p>For Cardiff, however, next season is all about survival rather than expansion. It promises to be quite a challenge, even allowing for the fact that they have been the team to catch in the Championship ever since the end of November and have a wealthy benefactor behind them. Vincent Tan, the club's Malaysian owner, has vowed to spend £25m in the Premier League, which is significantly more than Reading invested after winning the Championship last season but considerably less than Southampton, who secured the other automatic promotion berth, splurged in the summer.</p><p>For a blueprint for success in the Premier League, Tan believes Cardiff need to look no further than Swansea. \"I think it is a model that we should emulate,\" he said in February, when outlining his vision for Cardiff in the top flight. \"We should study more carefully and see how we can follow such a model. We can invest a bit more money than Swansea. They have managed to strategise well, so we would like to strategise well too.</p><p>\"But finally we would like to have some lucky breaks. We would like to buy, for example, someone along the Michu model. We would like to pay £2m and [the player] do very well for us, or pay £5m and do very well for us. But not pay £20m or £30m. We're not going to buy a Fernando Torres for £50m who doesn't score a goal for you. So we have got to be moderate, reasonable and hope for a good break.\"</p><p>Cardiff, in truth, have little in common with Swansea on and off the field.</p><p>In terms of the finances, Cardiff made a £13.6m loss in 2012 and have debts of £83m. Swansea, in contrast, reported a £15.9m profit for the six months up until the end of November 2012 and operate in the black. At Swansea there is supporter representation on the board. At Cardiff the fans have no say in the running of the club and were powerless to stop Tan from changing the kit colour from blue to red last summer.</p><p>When it comes to how things shape up on the pitch, Cardiff have more Premier League experience in their squad than Swansea did when they won promotion in 2011, although age is arguably against many of those players.</p><p>Tommy Smith will be 33 next month, Craig Bellamy turns 34 in July and Heidar Helguson, the club's top scorer with nine league goals, will be 36 in August. Fraizer Campbell, 25, has played in the top flight for three different clubs but he has scored only seven goals in 70 games at that level. Andrew Taylor, the former Middlesbrough left-back, is just about the only Cardiff player who is in his prime and has been a Premier League regular in the past.</p><p>Although Swansea lacked proven Premier League quality in their first season in the top flight, they had a way of playing – monopolising possession combined with a high intensity pressing game – that caused opponents plenty of problems and proved to be a major asset under the management of Brendan Rodgers, who also used the loan market well in that campaign. Cardiff, on the other hand, are much more functional; their success largely built on being solid defensively with a strong work ethic.</p><p>There is, of course, always the potential for unheralded players to blossom at the higher level, in the same way that Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Leon Britton and Joe Allen did for Swansea last season. Within the Cardiff ranks, David Marshall, whom Mackay rates as the best goalkeeper in the Championship, Mark Hudson, the captain, and the South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung, who has showed some nice touches in midfield, feel like the most likely candidates to catch the eye. We will also discover whether Peter Whittingham, who has been one of the most consistent performers in the Championship for several years, can make the step up.</p><p>Elsewhere, though, it feels as if Mackay has plenty of work to do to strengthen Cardiff's squad, despite what Tan said a couple of months ago, when he was asked whether the core of the team was strong enough to survive in the Premier League. \"I think it should be all right,\" he said. \"We also want to give the existing team the opportunity to play in the Premier League.

The owner, Vincent Tan, thought the club would thrive on the field and in the Asian market if they played in red and wore a dragon on their shirt. </em></p><p><em>Some fans were pragmatic enough to accept the changes. They have gone on to enjoy the uptake in the team's form that culminated in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/cardiff-celebrate-promotion-premier-league\">Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League on Tuesday night</a>. Other supporters, such as Scott Thomas, thought the bargain was not worth it. After 30 years of following the club, Thomas walked away from Cardiff City last summer. Here he explains his decision. </em></p><p>\"I don't watch Cardiff City games any more but, when I saw a picture of Craig Bellamy holding a red scarf emblazoned with dragons and the word 'Cardiff' rather than the club's proper name, it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. It confirmed that I made the right decision. I was surprisingly sanguine about the promotion. Cardiff City didn't go up last night; Cardiff City died last summer.</p><p>\"Seeing fans celebrate on the pitch during a news bulletin felt like watching the plug being pulled from a life-support machine that has been keeping an old relative alive. It was just another day at the office for club I no longer recognise. They are just another team now, not the one I supported for decades.</p><p>\"I never dreamed that Cardiff City would make it to the top flight and I wouldn't be there to see it. But the club I supported disappeared when a Malaysian businessman with no previous links to the city and no interest in its football took over Cardiff City and made it literally unrecognisable. The club I followed had history and traditions that went back 100 years, but now its future is subject to the whims of a single man.</p><p>\"I began supporting the club when my uncle and cousin took me to a match against Sheffield Wednesday in the 1975-76 season. I followed them to over 60 grounds in the fourth, third and second tiers with 25 friends I picked up over the years. I'm proud to say only a few of those guys renewed their season tickets for this season and some of them will not be renewing for next year.</p><p>\"It was big decision to walk away. Every fan has their own tipping point, but I knew immediately that I couldn't support a franchise. I wouldn't support a business like Tesco or Sainsbury's, and that's what Cardiff City have become. The club is no longer a community asset; it's just a football team that happens to play in the city. Cardiff City are one step away from MK Dons.</p><p>\"Many supporters stayed and many more will join now – people love a bandwagon – but a lot of the old-timers go less regularly and with less passion. More would have left, but a perfect storm of circumstances whipped fans into a demented reaction. They were desperate for success after so many near-misses and couldn't bear to see Swansea City do so well up the road.</p><p>\"I hate to admit it – old habits die hard – but Swansea City are a model club in many ways. Fan ownership has to be the way forward, but the Football Association aren't going protect the historical identity of clubs. The FA are just a booking agent for Wembley Stadium these days, as shown by the announcement of a 5.15pm kick-off time for this year's Cup final.</p><p>\"Even the national team are inferior to Premier League clubs now. Owners with money – or the promise of money – can do as they please. The FA didn't prevent Newcastle from rebranding their stadium and they didn't save Wimbledon, so they weren't going to save Cardiff City. We have listed buildings in this country, but football clubs are a free for all.</p><p>\"I could never support another club, but I've enjoyed watching other teams and other sports. I went to Wales's game in Scotland at Hampden last month, then to the Six Nations at Murrayfield and then to see Rangers play a few days later. Going to the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as rugby and boxing has been refreshing. On balance, it's better to be away from the venal, soul-destroying situation at Cardiff City.\"</p><p><em>Scott Thomas was speaking to Paul Campbell</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Twelve teams started into the first season on September 8 1888, which would produce Preston North End as their very first champions.</p><p>We've crunched the numbers of all 113 top flight seasons (1888-1892: Football League, 1892-1992: First Division, 1992-today: Premier League). Eleven seasons had been suspended during the first and second world wars.</p><p>Since the foundation of the Football League, a total of 64 teams have played at least one season in the respective top flight of English football. Everton, one of the twelve founding members, is currently playing its 110th season in the top league, having missed only four for two spells in the second division. It is topping the list of most seasons played in the top flight.</p><p>23 teams have been crowned champions at least once, Manchester United (19 titles), Liverpool (18) and Arsenal (13) being the most successful collectors of silverware. </p><p>If we combine the two metrics – championships won and seasons played in the top league – we can calculate an efficiency index in winning tropies when in the race. Which puts Huddersfield Town right in the top group along the above serial winners.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>From a geographical perspective, London might have been and still be the city with by far the most teams, but its the North-Western cities that picked up most of the trophies to date. Our map shows how the 113 championship trophies have been spread across the country.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Over all 113 completed seasons, the average number of goals scored is just above three per game. It has been the highest in the very beginning, at 4.63 in the second season. After being at a steady low for the past fourty years, average goals scored per game have been rising again in the past three seasons. They are now – at a current 2.83 goals per game – on course to finish higher than in any other season since 1967-68.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Finally, if we count every single game played in England's top league since it was founded towards one table, this is what it would look like as of April 14 2013. Points are counted as they were awarded at the time, so two points for a win until 1981, three afterwards (did you know that the initial idea of the founders was to award points for wins only, so that it would make no difference if you drew or lost a game?).</p><p>What can you do with this data?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/davidbauer.ch/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au5EaQXOeZRGdHZDalp4elMyUEgybDhmeGJDOWFwSHc#gid=0\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a><br />• SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.myfootballfacts.com/All-TimeTopFlightPointsTable1888-89to2010-11.html\">Myfootballfacts.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/about/history.html 15:56\">Premier League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/PastWinnersDetail/0,,10794~475363,00.html \">Football League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1888-89.html\">Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation</a></p><h2>NEW!

Under the steady hand of Malky Mackay, the Red Dragons (nee: Bluebirds) secured the point they needed against Charlton Athletic last night, prompting the kind of raucous carousing and celebrating last witnessed in the Welsh capital on the night of Charlotte Church's 21st birthday party.</p><p></p><p>The reaction to the Komodos' success has been mixed, with some supporters of other clubs appearing quite sniffy about the notion that in a romantic age when most successful British football clubs are owned by benevolent local mill owners eager to provide cheap entertainment for grateful workers to enjoy in their downtime, Cardiff have somehow 'cheated' by pumping millions into their club and changing the colour of their shirts in a bid to 'buy' success. The fact of the matter is, however, that like their Cardiff counterparts, most of these fans would happily wear pink replica shirts with a dancing cartoon Malayan tiger above a bowl of Nasi Goreng on the crest if they thought it would increase their club's chances of mixing it with the big boys and winning a trophy.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm very proud of the football club, the people of this club have had a lot of disappointment,\" said Mackay, who may well face disappointment of his own if chairman Vincent Tan decides further rebranding is required around the training ground. \"They have been through some tough times. The people of Cardiff have waited a long time to be back in the top division and they've never been in the Premier League. They've backed me and they've backed this football team and for that I will be forever grateful.\"</p><p></p><p>Among the locals celebrating on the pitch at the final whistle last night was a heavily tattooed young ruffian named Craig Bellamy, who signed permanently for his home-town club last August after leaving Liverpool for personal reasons. \"This is where we're from; we wear our heart on my sleeve,\" said Bellers, rather confusingly, who also famously wears an indelible depiction of the 1402 Battle of Pilleth, won by Owain Glyndwr, on his sleeve. \"I feel so privileged to have done it here, where the people I love most are nearby. I spoke to my father after the game, and he told me that he would now die a happy man.\"</p><p></p><p>With the Premier League fixtures to be announced on Wednesday 19 June, all eyes will now turn to Cardiff's two matches with Welsh rivals Swansea City, mouthwatering fixtures for which both clubs may well rebrand their club crests to incorporate cartoon dust-clouds with assorted fists, boots and 'oof!' noises emerging from them.

I did not go out to attack a horse. I love animals – I've got three dogs, a fish pond out the back and I feed foxes across the road. For some reason people are more upset about the fact that I hit a horse than a policewoman getting hurt. But I would like to apologise to the horse, to all the mounted section, to people of the north-east\" – Newcastle fan and animal-lover Barry Rogerson says sorry for swinging a haymaker at a police horse during the violence that erupted after Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. Rogerson went on to say he was wearing a scarf around his face at the time because it was \"cold\".</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"I note with some curiosity the almost complete lack of reaction to the FA's decision not to punish Sergio Agüero retrospectively for what appeared to be a concerted attempt to emasculate David Luiz from an unusual angle on Sunday. Oliver Holt tweeted at the time that 'there may have been a case for a straight red', presumably he meant with two-footed studs-up lunges at other players' upper thighs being such a disciplinary grey area. When compared to the universal outrage and debates about 'that type of player' that followed Callum McManaman's recent trangression being unpunished, the difference was stark. On the one hand it may be a positive sign that the English sporting press is finally progressing past the xenophobia that among other things has routinely seen foreign players roundly criticised for diving, while Tabloid Wayne and particularly $tevie Mbe's regular tangles with the invisible man go unremarked. On the other, it could just be the usual witless inconsistency of journalism born of populism writ large. Yeah, it's the other, isn't it\" – Jason Tew.</p><p></p><p>\"So … the FA suits continue to slavishly appease their television paymasters by shunting the FA Cup final forward two and a quarter hours to 5.15pm (yesterday's Quote of the Day). While it is no surprise that they show scant disregard for the travelling faithful from England's north-west, what about us poor Poms over here in Australia? The traditional midnight kick-off (Australian time) for this showpiece event was never ideal, but at least 'do-able'. Now the fan who is not in possession of a video recorder is faced with three choices: 1) go to bed super-early on Saturday night and set the alarm to be up super-early on Sunday morning; 2) go to bed super-late on Sunday morning and sleep in till late Sunday afternoon; or 3) sleep at a normal civilised hour and have a 'Likely Lads' day on Sunday, avoiding all contact with the outside world until such time as a televised re-run can be watched ostensibly live. Hang on … I've just thought of a fourth, even better, option: don't bother at all\" – Allastair McGillivray.</p><p></p><p>\"David McKee (yesterday's Fiver letters) cites 'double editions being sent, poor journalism, inaccurate score predictions and lack of humour' as 'recent incompetence' from the Fiver.

As I was in Florida, my experience of that incident was via that combustible mix of absurdity, bleakly cynical wit and outrage that ripples out in the form of Twitter fragments, whether in the aftermath of that crowd trouble in Newcastle, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/14/millwall-fa-wembley-wigan\">Milwall fans fighting among themselves at Wembley</a>, or, closer to home, the FC Dallas player George John being struck by a bottle thrown from <em>his own supporter's section</em>, after scoring an 88th minute winning goal against Los Angeles Galaxy — all incidents that occurred this weekend and that collectively gave the two days a surreally ugly quality. They're moments where disgust at the actual violence involved is mixed with a head-shaking disbelief at apparently grown adults who appear unable to grasp the fundamentally symbolic nature of sport, even when they're just there to watch. </p><p>In the George John case, for better or worse, the action seemed to be an isolated incident rather than a representation of typical behavior from a supporters group, or part of a pattern of crowd disturbances. That said, quite rightly the incident is being taken seriously by the club and MLS, and <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\">with reports of an attack on a Portland Timbers fan by San Jose supporters</a> this weekend, MLS reputation as a generally family friendly league is under scrutiny.</p><p><em></em></p><p>To take the John incident first, the player headed in the goal then appeared to many in the crowd to collide with the post and lie on the ground clutching the back of his head. The Dallas bench were initially unclear what had happened, and even the player didn't know what had struck him at first. When I spoke to the NBC team who were covering the game, Kyle Martino, who covers the games from between the team benches, confirmed that it was only when he started getting feedback over his headphones from the outside broadcast truck, about the replays showing the hurled bottle, that Dallas FC staff were alerted and began looking for the perpetrator. John, who'd come into the game as a doubt after receiving a concussion a week earlier, completed the game and actually joked with the broadcast team in interviews afterwards that next time the fans should drink the beer and not throw it, before leaving the scene for treatment on a nasty gash. </p><p>At time of writing neither MLS or FC Dallas owners had reached a decision on further action, though the two were in dialogue on Tuesday and an announcement was expected by Wednesday to indicate what action would follow from the club owners in the wake of the incident. In the meantime the club issued this short statement:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It is always unacceptable to throw anything onto the field of play because it endangers the safety of all players and personnel. In this specific incident, we have identified the individual and we are proceeding according to protocol with FC Dallas Stadium security, Frisco Police and Major League Soccer.</p></blockquote><p>To be clear, all of the Dallas Supporters group reps I spoke to, including our regular Guardian commenter Gina Zippilli, were genuinely mortified by the incident. The section of the ground the bottle was thrown from is a supporter group section, though admission to the section is not controlled by the supporter groups, and the particular individual involved is not believed to have been affiliated to any supporter group. Zippilli described a process of going through their member list and comparing photographs to NBC footage to try and identify the perpetrator, and talked about the \"idiot who turned a win into what felt like a loss, for how it would reflect on us.\" Zippilli is a member of the Inferno supporters group, some of whom were seated in the area, along with members of the Dallas Beer Guardians (a pun on the over-21 Beer Garden section of the stadium where the bottle was thrown from). </p><p>There have been sporadic similar incidents in the past in MLS: Sporting KC goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZjQhjmEP3c\">Jimmy Nielsen was struck by a bobblehead doll</a> during a game against Portland Timbers in 2011, and Houston Dynamo fans were punished by MLS for throwing objects during the MLS cup final in the same year. Each incident brings up questions about MLS supporter culture — which at its best melds elements of the constant singing of South American fans, the wit and chants of British fans, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jun/28/portland-timbers-seattle-sounders-tifo-display\">the conspicuous displays of the<em> tifosi</em></a> in an entertaining American hybrid. Lurking behind all of this appropriation and reinvention of course (and an ever present balancing act for MLS, clubs and even the formal supporter groups themselves) is the fear that certain fans might appropriate or imitate other less desirable cultural forms such as hooliganism, as misplaced marks of an authentic supporter culture. </p><p>For this reason, potentially as disturbing as the John incident, and perhaps more so (given the collective nature of it), were<a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\"> the reports that a Portland fan was set upon by a group of San Jose fans the next evening</a>. If true, that represents a rather more worrying development — sections of the San Jose support enjoy a somewhat mixed reputation among their peers as it is, and there have been previous incidents with rival LA groups when the two have met, but any suggestion that that behavior was bleeding into city centers at any scale will do little for the reputation of the league. </p><p>Somewhat encouragingly, the organized San Jose supporter groups such as the 1906 Ultras have been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1906Ultras?fref=ts\">quick to distance themselves from the perpetrators</a> and have suggested that if it transpires that any of their members were implicated, they will be expelled and the victims compensated. But in a week where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/16/nbc-premier-league-match-of-the-day\">NBC announced blanket coverage of the Premier League</a>, and in the wake of ESPN's expanded English language coverage of the Mexican league, it was disheartening to see any part of MLS participate in any form in the darker side of the culture of the sport, as it continues its slow, but seemingly inexorable globalizing push into the wider US consciousness.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls\">MLS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">US sports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fcdallas\">FC Dallas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/san-jose-earthquakes\">San Jose Earthquakes</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graham-parker\">Graham Parker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The little striker's stock-in-trade move had brought his first goal at club level of the year. And with the crowd at fever pitch, another substitute, Tom Huddlestone, released Bale, who exploded clear of his City shackles before clipping a delightful finish over Joe Hart.</p><p>City could not believe it. They might have been fortunate to avoid seeing Nasri sent off in the eighth minute for a terrible challenge on Kyle Walker but they deserved more from their general contribution to the spectacle. Instead, as has been the theme of their championship defence, they were left with regrets. There had been no doubt about which club needed these points the most but the manner in which Tottenham seized them was breathtaking.</p><p>Roberto Mancini's intent had been plain at the start, with two men up front and menace in midfield, and his team crafted the early marker. There appeared to be little on as Carlos Tevez scuttled to win the ball and hold it up by the corner flag, with Jan Vertonghen at his back. But Tevez worked a little room, turned and slipped a pass inside the ball-watching Scott Parker for the on-rushing Gareth Barry. His pull-back invited Nasri to guide a volley into the corner of the net. For the former Arsenal player, it was a sweet moment.</p><p>City's form has come too late for their title defence but they have regularly been good to watch in recent weeks and there was a lot to like about their game here. Tevez was relentless, epitomising the team's collective work ethic and he dovetailed seamlessly with Edin Dzeko, who scored four times in this fixture last season. It was possible to fear for Tottenham every time City swept forward in the first half. Nasri was elusive in a good way, although his studs-up, over-the-ball connection with Walker's shin was an ugly moment. The only conclusion to draw about the lack of censure was that the referee, Lee Mason, could not have seen it.</p><p>The game ought to have been over at the interval. Pablo Zabaleta and Tevez combined to release Nasri and, as white shirts converged, he poked narrowly wide of the far post while Hugo Lloris twice made excellent saves. First, after Tevez had set Dzeko in between the Tottenham centre-halves, the goalkeeper flung out his right hand to block and then, from Tevez's header, his reflexes were first-rate.</p><p>Tottenham did have first-half chances. Dempsey weighted a pass inside Nasri for Walker but Hart left his line quickly to make the target sufficiently small – Walker's shot flew off him – while Dempsey directed a free header over the crossbar from a 44th-minute corner.</p><p>The second half had felt seismic from the outset for Tottenham. If they were to make a statement regarding their Champions League aspirations, it surely needed to come here. City pressed and stifled and, for so long, Villas-Boas's players appeared to have few options in possession. Where could the inspiration come from?</p><p>The answer was obvious. Bale was peripheral for most of the match, struggling to exert an influence from his starting central role and, for the first part of the second half, on the right flank. The home crowd feared the worst and they had taken to outlandish appeals for penalties when Bale, suddenly, helped to turn the game on its head. His assist for Dempsey was the spark; his ice-cool finish the clinching moment.

One player, Kidderminster's Lee Vaughan, was punched before the referee, Michael Bull, intervened to take both teams off the pitch.</p><p>The incident comes a week after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/13/millwall-fa-cup-violence-wembley\" title=\"\">crowd trouble marred the FA Cup semi-final between Millwall and Wigan</a> at Wembley, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/15/newcastle-embarrassed-violence-sunderland-loss\" title=\"\">clashes between Newcastle fans and police</a> following their Premier League defeat to Sunderland.</p><p>Speaking after the game, a 4-0 win for Kidderminster which relegated Stockport, Vaughan called the fan who assaulted him a \"disgrace\", adding: \"I am glad they are going down and I hope they go down again.

Instead, proper football has recently taken up residence on ITV4 HD in a programme called <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/the-big-match-revisited\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Match Revisited</em></a>. I pre-recorded about 10 of them, for I have discovered that they provide the perfect accompaniment to a 3am kebab after a midweek networking event. Sometimes, they are ideal in that twilight hour on an early Saturday evening after the vigil mass has ended and before the Bacardi bacchanal begins.</p><p>The <em>Big Match Revisited</em> has been transporting us these last few weeks back to the spring of 1979 and, in particular, to the closing stages of a very tight English Second Division promotion race. Thus we have been treated to Terry Venables's fledgling and gifted young Crystal Palace side and matches between Sunderland and Wrexham featuring players such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_McNeil\" title=\"\">Dixie McNeil</a> playing on glaury surfaces and making the sort of challenges that afterwards have their opponents counting their balls rather than merely rubbing them. \"Going in like a cancan dancer,\" is how the <em>Sunday Post</em>'s late, and much lamented, Doug Baillie would have described these tackles. The shows were usually presented by the ineffable Brian Moore and sometimes by a dapper wee chap called Elton Welsby, who always looked like he was auditioning to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/may/19/smalltalk.sportinterviews\" title=\"\">Dickie Davies</a> on ITV's flagship, and rather salty, <em>World of Sport</em>.</p><p>Last week, though, we got extended <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_92fHskQCo\" title=\"\">highlights</a> of the 1979 FA Cup final between Manchester United and Arsenal, which the London side won in a 3-2 thriller. This was the one where three goals were scored in the last three minutes and the old Wembley looked serene and majestic. Of the 22 players who started the match, only seven were English. The rest of the players were gathered from each of the other four British Isles nations, six of whom – Arthur Albiston, Gordon McQueen, Martin Buchan, Joe Jordan, Lou Macari, Willie Young – were Scots.</p><p>In the 34 years that have passed since then, we find that England's ability at football has not changed much; they still can't get young native talent into their top teams and are as far away as ever from winning a serious international tournament. Five of those Scottish players had been regulars in an international team that was in Europe's top 10. The other, Willie Young, was a member of the infamous Copenhagen Five in 1975, the last time Scotland ever caused serious mischief away from home either on or off the park. In 2013, Scotland is a third world football nation and now takes its place alongside the Faroes, the San Marinos and the Liechtensteins of European football. Burkino Faso, Sierra Leone and the Cape Verde Islands are all ahead of us in Fifa's international rankings.</p><p>Last month, we became the first team in Europe to be knocked out of the race to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil. Our best hope of ever qualifying for this event before the end of the 21st century may have to rest within the loins of a specially chosen battalion of vigorous young Scots, tasked with attending Rio next year and having some carnal behaviour with local women. This will be a sacred mission.</p><p>Scotland's footballing demise over the past 20 years or so has been slow and inexorable. Yet what has occurred this season makes you wonder how we could have offended the Almighty so much. Until last Monday, the only circus in town was the one at Rangers, forced to start again in football's fourth tier following liquidation and screaming silently as speculators still play dice with each other over what remains of the club. Rangers' downfall is hurting Scottish football, including their great rivals, Celtic, who are playing regularly to half-empty stadiums in the only competition in world football where the outcome is known before a ball has been kicked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In order to reconfigure Scottish football and nurse it back to something approaching rude health, the authorities attempted a league reconstruction that generous-minded souls might have described as \"fanciful\". It involved creating a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2259101/A-new-dawn-SFA-chief-Regan-hails-new-dawn-Scotland-set-radical-restructuring.html\" title=\"\">12-12-18</a> three-league structure that would metamorphose into something else two-thirds into the season. At some point, the top six (or the bottom six) all do the hokey cokey and turn around (anticlockwise). To make sense of it, you would need to feed it into the Large Hadron Collider. Last week, the plan was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22210069\" title=\"\">jettisoned</a>. This led to the sort of anger displayed by Steve Carell's character in the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\"><em>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</em></a>.</p><p>In a nation of 5.2 million souls, we have 42 senior football clubs, several of which are a fortnight away from the knacker's yard. There are three separate management bodies to oversee the game, each presided over by a superannuated cost accountant type with a salary and responsibility utterly disproportionate, it would seem, to his ability. England (pop: 53 million) has 92 senior teams.</p><p>Football in Scotland is being sunk by the combined weight of its bureaucracy and needs to be run by a single body. I acknowledge that the number of redundancies resulting from this among the blazerati would need an enterprise zone all to itself but, well… cruel to be kind and all that. And the only reconstruction should be that forced upon Scottish clubs to ensure that a minimum number of Scots must feature in their first team.</p><p>There are, though, some faint traces of light piercing the darkness. Last November, I watched Scotland's under-16 team play their England counterparts at Burton Albion's ground.

Instead, proper football has recently taken up residence on ITV4 HD in a programme called <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/the-big-match-revisited\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Match Revisited</em></a>. I pre-recorded about 10 of them, for I have discovered that they provide the perfect accompaniment to a 3am kebab after a midweek networking event. Sometimes, they are ideal in that twilight hour on an early Saturday evening after the vigil mass has ended and before the Bacardi bacchanal begins.</p><p>The <em>Big Match Revisited</em> has been transporting us these last few weeks back to the spring of 1979 and, in particular, to the closing stages of a very tight English Second Division promotion race. Thus we have been treated to Terry Venables's fledgling and gifted young Crystal Palace side and matches between Sunderland and Wrexham featuring players such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_McNeil\" title=\"\">Dixie McNeil</a> playing on glaury surfaces and making the sort of challenges that afterwards have their opponents counting their balls rather than merely rubbing them. \"Going in like a cancan dancer,\" is how the <em>Sunday Post</em>'s late, and much lamented, Doug Baillie would have described these tackles. The shows were usually presented by the ineffable Brian Moore and sometimes by a dapper wee chap called Elton Welsby, who always looked like he was auditioning to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/may/19/smalltalk.sportinterviews\" title=\"\">Dickie Davies</a> on ITV's flagship, and rather salty, <em>World of Sport</em>.</p><p>Last week, though, we got extended <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_92fHskQCo\" title=\"\">highlights</a> of the 1979 FA Cup final between Manchester United and Arsenal, which the London side won in a 3-2 thriller. This was the one where three goals were scored in the last three minutes and the old Wembley looked serene and majestic. Of the 22 players who started the match, only seven were English. The rest of the players were gathered from each of the other four British Isles nations, six of whom – Arthur Albiston, Gordon McQueen, Martin Buchan, Joe Jordan, Lou Macari, Willie Young – were Scots.</p><p>In the 34 years that have passed since then, we find that England's ability at football has not changed much; they still can't get young native talent into their top teams and are as far away as ever from winning a serious international tournament. Five of those Scottish players had been regulars in an international team that was in Europe's top 10. The other, Willie Young, was a member of the infamous Copenhagen Five in 1975, the last time Scotland ever caused serious mischief away from home either on or off the park. In 2013, Scotland is a third world football nation and now takes its place alongside the Faroes, the San Marinos and the Liechtensteins of European football. Burkino Faso, Sierra Leone and the Cape Verde Islands are all ahead of us in Fifa's international rankings.</p><p>Last month, we became the first team in Europe to be knocked out of the race to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil. Our best hope of ever qualifying for this event before the end of the 21st century may have to rest within the loins of a specially chosen battalion of vigorous young Scots, tasked with attending Rio next year and having some carnal behaviour with local women. This will be a sacred mission.</p><p>Scotland's footballing demise over the past 20 years or so has been slow and inexorable. Yet what has occurred this season makes you wonder how we could have offended the Almighty so much. Until last Monday, the only circus in town was the one at Rangers, forced to start again in football's fourth tier following liquidation and screaming silently as speculators still play dice with each other over what remains of the club. Rangers' downfall is hurting Scottish football, including their great rivals, Celtic, who are playing regularly to half-empty stadiums in the only competition in world football where the outcome is known before a ball has been kicked.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In order to reconfigure Scottish football and nurse it back to something approaching rude health, the authorities attempted a league reconstruction that generous-minded souls might have described as \"fanciful\". It involved creating a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2259101/A-new-dawn-SFA-chief-Regan-hails-new-dawn-Scotland-set-radical-restructuring.html\" title=\"\">12-12-18</a> three-league structure that would metamorphose into something else two-thirds into the season. At some point, the top six (or the bottom six) all do the hokey cokey and turn around (anticlockwise). To make sense of it, you would need to feed it into the Large Hadron Collider. Last week, the plan was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22210069\" title=\"\">jettisoned</a>. This led to the sort of anger displayed by Steve Carell's character in the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\"><em>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</em></a>.</p><p>In a nation of 5.2 million souls, we have 42 senior football clubs, several of which are a fortnight away from the knacker's yard. There are three separate management bodies to oversee the game, each presided over by a superannuated cost accountant type with a salary and responsibility utterly disproportionate, it would seem, to his ability. England (pop: 53 million) has 92 senior teams.</p><p>Football in Scotland is being sunk by the combined weight of its bureaucracy and needs to be run by a single body. I acknowledge that the number of redundancies resulting from this among the blazerati would need an enterprise zone all to itself but, well… cruel to be kind and all that. And the only reconstruction should be that forced upon Scottish clubs to ensure that a minimum number of Scots must feature in their first team.</p><p>There are, though, some faint traces of light piercing the darkness. Last November, I watched Scotland's under-16 team play their England counterparts at Burton Albion's ground. The young Scots lost <a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-u16s/News/2012/scotland-burton-albion-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0</a> against players schooled at the English Premier League's richest academies but not before they outplayed their opponents for prolonged periods of the match.</p><p>I also saw something long forgotten in these parts: the sight of footballers in Scotland shirts, two-footed, technically adept and passing at tempo. I have often watched the recording to remind myself that it actually happened.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/scotland\">Scotland</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland\">Scotland</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kevin-mckenna\">Kevin McKenna</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He told the crowd last Monday that the two most important words in the English language are \"Me mum\". Sitting in a wheelchair in the crowd was the redoubtable force that was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/18/hillsborough-campaigner-anne-williams-dies1\" title=\"\">Anne Williams</a> whose son, Kevin, had been killed at Hillsborough, in 1989, aged 15. Anne, 62, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last autumn. On Thursday, she died.</p><p>She did so with the knowledge that she had obtained justice for her son and 95 other victims after a battle that had taken her and her fellow campaigners almost a quarter of a century. Last December, the original inquest verdict of accidental death was quashed. Kevin had not died before 3.15pm, as Sheffield coroner Dr Stefan Popper had originally ruled, but at 4pm. He might have been saved. His final word was \"Mum\". Anne had initiated the long, slow process that has yet to reveal the full extent of the shameful establishment cover-up.</p><p>This week also sees the 20th anniversary of the racist murder of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/20/stephen-lawrence-archbishop-of-york-fight-racism\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence</a>. In the <em>New Review</em>, his courageous mother, Doreen, describes the years of struggle before she successfully obtained the 1999 judicial review that led to the Metropolitan police being forced to address its ingrained institutional racism. Doreen, born in Jamaica in 1952, had worked in a bank before marrying at 20 and, two years later, having Stephen, who planned to be an architect.</p><p>Anne, the daughter of a farm labourer, left school at 15, became a secretary and then a part-time barmaid. Both women come from a tradition of mothers who are \"ordinary\" only in that they begin as amateurs in the fields of law, forensic science, police investigation (or the lack of it), the judiciary and systematic malpractice. Propelled by grief and a deep sense of injustice, they graduate to become highly professional truth-seekers, sacrificing much of their normal lives in the process.</p><p>Fathers, too, embark on such crusades, but they face different hurdles. Women have long experience of highly qualified male experts telling them where they are going wrong, how they are misguided, the extent of how little they know – and especially so when it comes to the skills of parenting, as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24455.For_Her_Own_Good\" title=\"\">Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English</a> detail in <em>For Her Own Good</em>. Plenty of professionals, through the years and from a masculine point of view, have treated \"motherhood as pathology\". Women are too motherly \"enwombing\" or not maternal enough; over-involved or damagingly distant. Certainly, the ways in which Doreen Lawrence and Anne Williams were patronised for years by those they sought to hold to account would have come as no surprise to either. And still they triumphed.</p><p>We are constantly told that consumerism has spread its influence to the commodification of time (\"buying time\"), experience and even relationships.

He told the crowd last Monday that the two most important words in the English language are \"Me mum\". Sitting in a wheelchair in the crowd was the redoubtable force that was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/18/hillsborough-campaigner-anne-williams-dies1\" title=\"\">Anne Williams</a> whose son, Kevin, had been killed at Hillsborough, in 1989, aged 15. Anne, 62, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last autumn. On Thursday, she died.</p><p>She did so with the knowledge that she had obtained justice for her son and 95 other victims after a battle that had taken her and her fellow campaigners almost a quarter of a century. Last December, the original inquest verdict of accidental death was quashed. Kevin had not died before 3.15pm, as Sheffield coroner Dr Stefan Popper had originally ruled, but at 4pm. He might have been saved. His final word was \"Mum\". Anne had initiated the long, slow process that has yet to reveal the full extent of the shameful establishment cover-up.</p><p>This week also sees the 20th anniversary of the racist murder of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/20/stephen-lawrence-archbishop-of-york-fight-racism\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence</a>. In the <em>New Review</em>, his courageous mother, Doreen, describes the years of struggle before she successfully obtained the 1999 judicial review that led to the Metropolitan police being forced to address its ingrained institutional racism. Doreen, born in Jamaica in 1952, had worked in a bank before marrying at 20 and, two years later, having Stephen, who planned to be an architect.</p><p>Anne, the daughter of a farm labourer, left school at 15, became a secretary and then a part-time barmaid. Both women come from a tradition of mothers who are \"ordinary\" only in that they begin as amateurs in the fields of law, forensic science, police investigation (or the lack of it), the judiciary and systematic malpractice. Propelled by grief and a deep sense of injustice, they graduate to become highly professional truth-seekers, sacrificing much of their normal lives in the process.</p><p>Fathers, too, embark on such crusades, but they face different hurdles. Women have long experience of highly qualified male experts telling them where they are going wrong, how they are misguided, the extent of how little they know – and especially so when it comes to the skills of parenting, as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24455.For_Her_Own_Good\" title=\"\">Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English</a> detail in <em>For Her Own Good</em>. Plenty of professionals, through the years and from a masculine point of view, have treated \"motherhood as pathology\". Women are too motherly \"enwombing\" or not maternal enough; over-involved or damagingly distant. Certainly, the ways in which Doreen Lawrence and Anne Williams were patronised for years by those they sought to hold to account would have come as no surprise to either. And still they triumphed.</p><p>We are constantly told that consumerism has spread its influence to the commodification of time (\"buying time\"), experience and even relationships. But some bonds will always defy prevailing market values. We are all perhaps fortunate that mothers, who instinctively know what's right for their sons and daughters, are a strong part of where pure and powerful integrity presides.</p><p><em>•</em> Comments will be switched on later this morning</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hillsborough-disaster\">Hillsborough disaster</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/doreen-lawrence\">Doreen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/yvonneroberts\">Yvonne Roberts</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The latest disappointment came at home to Leicester who twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at Selhurst Park. \"We're disappointed with that having been in front twice but it's important to have got a point,\" said the Palace manager, Ian Holloway. \"I would have preferred two more but you've got to take what you can.\" Holloway promised that his team would \"tweak the nose of fear and stick an ice cube down the vest of terror\" over the remainder of the season.</p><p>Bolton overtook Leicester to move into the last play-off place thanks to a 2-1 win at home to Middlesbrough, all the goals coming in the space of 10 second-half minutes. \"What you've got is a group of players who have got a spirit you can't deny,\" said Dougie Freedman. \"No team I believe in the top six have got that right now.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wolves\">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/charltonathletic\">Charlton Athletic</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Fail to do so and Spurs will be unlikely to crack it, unless their main rivals – Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton – go off the scent too, which, of course, should not be ruled out in this most curious of pursuits.</p><p>Just over a month ago, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/03/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-match-report\" title=\"\">a 2-1 victory over Arsenal</a> put them comfortably in third place, seven points clear of their north London neighbours, Tottenham seemed well on track to reclaim the Champions League place they were so agonisingly denied last season when Chelsea gazumped them. But André Villas-Boas's team have picked up just four points from the last 12 available and are playing catch-up again. Some fans fret that the club is in the midst of the sort of late-season decline that afflicted them last term, but the dips have been spread more evenly throughout this see-saw season.</p><p>Spurs have lost 21 points from winning positions this season, more than any side in the Premier League other than Reading, Aston Villa and Southampton. The midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson believes the most costly slip-ups were the late goals conceded early in the campaign that led to home draws with West Bromwich Albion and Norwich and defeats against Newcastle and Wigan, which were followed by a late reverse at the Etihad against Sunday's opponents. \"We were not good enough at the beginning of the season,\" Sigurdsson said. \"We dropped too many points late in games.\"</p><p>At least that was understandable. After all, following the departures of influential players such as Luka Modric, Rafael van der Vaart and Ledley King, Spurs had to integrate a raft of new players this year, including Sigurdsson, and all under a new manager. \"It took a bit of time for everything to fall into place,\" explains Sigurdsson, who identifies the 3-2 win at West Ham in February – when Spurs rather than their opponents staged a late comeback – as the most formative so far for this new team. \"I think it was one of those games where you start to realise you've got something special,\" he says. \"It's a tough place to go to, as you saw with Manchester United drawing there this week, so to come from behind and win was very important for us.\"</p><p>Spurs beat Arsenal the following weekend. And then their latest stutter began so, lo and behold, they find themselves needing to come from behind again, having fallen to fifth place.

Fail to do so and Spurs will be unlikely to crack it, unless their main rivals – Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton – go off the scent too, which, of course, should not be ruled out in this most curious of pursuits.</p><p>Just over a month ago, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/03/tottenham-hotspur-arsenal-match-report\" title=\"\">a 2-1 victory over Arsenal</a> put them comfortably in third place, seven points clear of their north London neighbours, Tottenham seemed well on track to reclaim the Champions League place they were so agonisingly denied last season when Chelsea gazumped them. But André Villas-Boas's team have picked up just four points from the last 12 available and are playing catch-up again. Some fans fret that the club is in the midst of the sort of late-season decline that afflicted them last term, but the dips have been spread more evenly throughout this see-saw season.</p><p>Spurs have lost 21 points from winning positions this season, more than any side in the Premier League other than Reading, Aston Villa and Southampton. The midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson believes the most costly slip-ups were the late goals conceded early in the campaign that led to home draws with West Bromwich Albion and Norwich and defeats against Newcastle and Wigan, which were followed by a late reverse at the Etihad against Sunday's opponents. \"We were not good enough at the beginning of the season,\" Sigurdsson said. \"We dropped too many points late in games.\"</p><p>At least that was understandable. After all, following the departures of influential players such as Luka Modric, Rafael van der Vaart and Ledley King, Spurs had to integrate a raft of new players this year, including Sigurdsson, and all under a new manager. \"It took a bit of time for everything to fall into place,\" explains Sigurdsson, who identifies the 3-2 win at West Ham in February – when Spurs rather than their opponents staged a late comeback – as the most formative so far for this new team. \"I think it was one of those games where you start to realise you've got something special,\" he says. \"It's a tough place to go to, as you saw with Manchester United drawing there this week, so to come from behind and win was very important for us.\"</p><p>Spurs beat Arsenal the following weekend. And then their latest stutter began so, lo and behold, they find themselves needing to come from behind again, having fallen to fifth place. A couple of personnel comebacks could certainly help them today: Gareth Bale and Jermain Defoe are expected to return from injury, and Aaron Lennon may do so too. They are three crucial players for Spurs. And if Sergio Agüero and David Silva fail to regain fitness in time for City, then Tottenham will fancy their chances even more of being on the right side of the latest turnaround in their season.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/pauldoyle\">Paul Doyle</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By that point Guzan had already cleared his locker, bid farewell to his team-mates and was back in the United States wondering what the future held. The answer – being a leading contender to be named Villa's player of the year 11 months later – would never have entered his head.</p><p>Guzan looks a little embarrassed to be singled out for such praise, although when it comes to Villa's standout performer this season, it is a straightforward choice between the 28-year-old American goalkeeper and the striker Christian Benteke. Brought into the team for the third game of the season at Shay Given's expense, Guzan seized his chance and has fully justified Paul Lambert's faith in him. One statistic perfectly sums up his contribution in a turbulent season for the Midlanders: he is the only Premier League goalkeeper to have made more than 200 saves.</p><p>\"Football is so funny, you don't know what is going to happen,\" Guzan says, reflecting on last summer's events. \"I had said my goodbyes and technically I was released. I think there was a mutual respect where we said we'll continue to talk, but for me the most important thing was to be given a fair shake at it because under the last manager [Alex McLeish] it didn't feel that was going to be the situation. If [McLeish] had stayed, the writing was on the wall that I was going to have to go. I know my agent had spoken to other clubs.</p><p>\"But when the new manager was named, Terry [Gennoe], the goalkeeping coach, said [Lambert] wanted to have a chat. I spoke to the manager on the phone and said: 'I'd like to continue this conversation but I'd like to come to England.' Face to face you get a better vibe for what is being said. I got an overnight flight to Chicago on the Tuesday, flew into London on the Wednesday morning, had a two-hour drive to Birmingham, had the meeting, got back in the taxi to Heathrow and was back in Chicago on Wednesday night, all in less than 24 hours.</p><p>\"For me this was a big point in my career, the national team picture was starting to fade away, I hadn't played consistent club football for four years, so that [journey] was the least I could have done to give myself the best chance to make the right decision. At the meeting the manager said to me: 'Listen, everyone starts fresh. I don't make the decisions, the players do in terms of performances.' All things considered, I felt I could give it a real go.\"</p><p>While Guzan has relished the chance to establish himself as Villa's No1, after spending so much time in the shadow of Brad Friedel and then Given, it has been a challenging season facing the threat of relegation. Villa go into Monday's game at Manchester United in decent form, after picking up 10 points from their last five matches, but much of the campaign has been a struggle, in particular when they were knocked out of both cups by lower league opposition in January on the back of some humiliating defeats in the Premier League.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/23/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league\" title=\"\">8-0 hammering at Stamford Bridge</a>, where Guzan was praised for preventing Chelsea from racking up double figures, was as bad as it gets. \"On a day like that you don't want to talk about it, you kind of want to shut down,\" Guzan says. \"But, at the same time, you have to analyse it and look at it in the same way as if you won 1-0. You have to be man enough and say it was a shit day at the office. Unfortunately for us, a shit day at the office is not only in front of 40,000 fans but all over national television and all over the world.\"</p><p></p><p>When Villa lost their next two games at home, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/26/aston-villa-tottenham-match-report\" title=\"\">4-0 against Tottenham Hotspur </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/26/aston-villa-tottenham-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 to Wigan</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/27/brad-guzan-aston-villa-humblings\" title=\"\">flak was flying</a>. \"As a team, everyone criticised us and said we were terrible and we had no chance. But we never let it affect us,\" Guzan says. \"I have continually said: 'We understand the quality and the ability that we have in the dressing room and the belief and the confidence we have in each other.' And probably people looked at me as if I was talking rubbish. Now all of a sudden people are saying we have come out better for it. Well, we knew we would.\"</p><p>Guzan is a likable character, loquacious and generous with his time. Born in Illinois, he was a model student at school but always had a passion for football, so much so that he was happy to play anywhere on the pitch until well into his late teens. \"I played outfield in a national final when I was 18,\" he says. \"Afterwards I found out that the under-18 national team coach had heard about me as a goalkeeper and came to see me play. He said to my coach: 'I've come to see Brad.' My coach said: 'Right, well he's playing outfield today.'\"</p><p>He went on to study sport management at the University of South Carolina but left after two years to play in the MLS for Chivas USA, which was where he came to Villa's attention. Guzan signed for Villa in 2008 and was prepared to bide his time initially, picking up experience in cup games, where he made four penalty saves against Sunderland en route to Villa reaching the 2010 League Cup final. Having played in every round, Guzan was distraught when Martin O'Neill picked Friedel to start against Manchester United at Wembley.</p><p>\"It was a massive blow,\" he says. \"But as big a disappointment as it was, I could have used it one of two ways. I could have sulked and let everyone know about it.

His father-in-law was injured in the attack so hopefully he has pulled through some of the surgeries,\" Guzan says. \"I think he still needs prayers and well wishes.

By that point Guzan had already cleared his locker, bid farewell to his team-mates and was back in the United States wondering what the future held. The answer – being a leading contender to be named Villa's player of the year 11 months later – would never have entered his head.</p><p>Guzan looks a little embarrassed to be singled out for such praise, although when it comes to Villa's standout performer this season, it is a straightforward choice between the 28-year-old American goalkeeper and the striker Christian Benteke. Brought into the team for the third game of the season at Shay Given's expense, Guzan seized his chance and has fully justified Paul Lambert's faith in him. One statistic perfectly sums up his contribution in a turbulent season for the Midlanders: he is the only Premier League goalkeeper to have made more than 200 saves.</p><p>\"Football is so funny, you don't know what is going to happen,\" Guzan says, reflecting on last summer's events. \"I had said my goodbyes and technically I was released. I think there was a mutual respect where we said we'll continue to talk, but for me the most important thing was to be given a fair shake at it because under the last manager [Alex McLeish] it didn't feel that was going to be the situation. If [McLeish] had stayed, the writing was on the wall that I was going to have to go. I know my agent had spoken to other clubs.</p><p>\"But when the new manager was named, Terry [Gennoe], the goalkeeping coach, said [Lambert] wanted to have a chat. I spoke to the manager on the phone and said: 'I'd like to continue this conversation but I'd like to come to England.' Face to face you get a better vibe for what is being said. I got an overnight flight to Chicago on the Tuesday, flew into London on the Wednesday morning, had a two-hour drive to Birmingham, had the meeting, got back in the taxi to Heathrow and was back in Chicago on Wednesday night, all in less than 24 hours.</p><p>\"For me this was a big point in my career, the national team picture was starting to fade away, I hadn't played consistent club football for four years, so that [journey] was the least I could have done to give myself the best chance to make the right decision. At the meeting the manager said to me: 'Listen, everyone starts fresh. I don't make the decisions, the players do in terms of performances.' All things considered, I felt I could give it a real go.\"</p><p>While Guzan has relished the chance to establish himself as Villa's No1, after spending so much time in the shadow of Brad Friedel and then Given, it has been a challenging season facing the threat of relegation. Villa go into Monday's game at Manchester United in decent form, after picking up 10 points from their last five matches, but much of the campaign has been a struggle, in particular when they were knocked out of both cups by lower league opposition in January on the back of some humiliating defeats in the Premier League.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/23/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league\" title=\"\">8-0 hammering at Stamford Bridge</a>, where Guzan was praised for preventing Chelsea from racking up double figures, was as bad as it gets. \"On a day like that you don't want to talk about it, you kind of want to shut down,\" Guzan says. \"But, at the same time, you have to analyse it and look at it in the same way as if you won 1-0.

Football loves a sweeping narrative and in Bayern v Barça and Dortmund v Real there is a sense of certain shared sporting values that go beyond mere geography, a butterfly print of matching elites from which the committed Rorschach theorist might draw all manner of overheated conclusions. But if the significance of such moments of dominance can often be overstated – exhibit one: the unstoppable rise of the Premier League (sell-by date 2011) – there is still a starkness to this semi-final lineup, a sense of a greater historical ascent in play. Something is happening here. But what, exactly?</p><p>Perhaps the most striking element of this drift towards a Germano-Iberian duopoly is the feeling not of opposed and contrasting superpowers, but of convergence and consensus, of a fraternal similarity. The dawning of the age of Iberia may have been upon us for some time, but in the Bayern supremacy it finds an answering echo: if Germany and Spain are streets ahead when it comes to player development and tactical coherence, they appear to have skipped off around the corner more or less hand-in-hand.</p><p>There will, of course, be some tribal dissent – and to be fair Manchester United were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/05/manchester-united-real-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">smothering Real Madrid into submission before Nani's red card</a> – but it is worth noting the broad consensus is that these are inarguably Europe's top four teams this year. \"It's no coincidence,\" says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DietmarHamann\" title=\"\">Dietmar Hamann</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/may/26/match.acmilan\" title=\"\">winner of this competition with Liverpool in 2005</a>. \"The four best teams are in the semis, which has not really been the case for the last 10 years. They are here because they deserve it and I think all the other teams are behind these. I could see any one of these four winning the Champions League, but I haven't been able to see any of the English teams winning it at any stage this year.\"</p><p>Beyond this the Bundes-Liga semi‑final full-house fits a wider trend. The last four Champions League finals have featured either Barça or Bayern, while eight of the last 12 semi-finalists have been Spanish or German, eclipsing with surprising abruptness a similar run of late-stage hegemony for the Premier League. Albeit, we are of course talking about a small cartel of elite clubs here. The most obvious shared quality, beyond mere nationality, is the sheer scale and reach of three of the four clubs involved, the fiscal and geographical heft of Barcelona, Bayern and Real. These are collectively Europe's ascendant regional superpower clubs, brilliantly marketed to a captive nation-state fanbase and their attendant corporate backers.</p><p>Undoubtedly financial heft is the bedrock of this ascent: in Real and Barcelona the semi-finals host two of the three richest clubs around, and in Bayern the world's most prolific football merchandise machine. You don't have to be a peerless commercial powerhouse to become a part of football's oligarchical elite – but it helps.</p><p>This, though, is about more than just money. It is also a matter of style and content, a set of shared characteristics expressed within the confines of the pitch, and relating to things like tempo and texture and basic notions of how exactly a football team should go about its business. If you were to attempt to define a German and a Spanish style right now you would most likely end up with two differing but also seductively conjoined models. Spain, and in particular Barcelona, are of course the masters of the pass, a method based around the notion of tiny spaces picked apart through relentless high-spec shuttling of the point of possession. The basic approach is to treat the ball as though it is the final bullet in your revolver. This will be a lovingly crafted execution.</p><p>If German teams have a general point of contrast it is perhaps in their greater adherence to Joachim Löw's notion of football as a sport \"defined by a succession of sprints\". Both the national team and Bayern employ direct and purposeful bursts of intelligent movement: not running for runnings's sake, but concerted sprints, either in small pockets or across the pitch.

The evidence suggests a strong spine of home-reared domestic players is what separates the very best from those who merely have the outline, and deep pockets, of a European super-team. German and Spanish have been the most heavily represented nationalities in the last four Champions League finals, tribute in itself to their fecund academy systems.

Those few months at the age of 18-20 make a huge difference. You only get one chance at it.\"</p><p>There are sound fiscal incentives for Bundesliga clubs to make sure that chance is generously extended. The top two tiers combined spend more than €100m on their academies each year, with notable successes. Bayern boast the home-growns Thomas Müller, Toni Kroos, Holger Badstuber, Diego Contento, Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger, while across the Bundesliga 275 out of 525 players used in 2010-11 were domestic academy products. The situation is similar in Spain, where Athletic Bilbao have used 20 academy players this season, Real Sociedad 16, Barcelona 15 and even fiscally incontinent Madrid seven.</p><p>Plus, of course, the system is applied with progressive good sense. Simply having an academy isn't enough: it is the rigour, the centralised standards, and above all the willingness to accept that technique rather than physique are the essence of a good young player. If the field seems open here for a little Premier League-bashing, it is worth noting that this particular element, the home-reared core, also speaks to the recent era of Premier League success. The Manchester United teams that won the Champions League both contained six British outfield players in their starting eleven. Liverpool in 2005 were forged around the armature of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. Even last season's haphazardly concocted Chelsea triumph was, paradoxically, a team effort that drew its strength not from an endless drenching in imported exoticisms, but from a largely English spine that had been in place for almost a decade.</p><p></p><p>If this combination of a highly marketable regional identity married to a domestically forged footballing backbone appears to represent the perfect storm for European club success, it has broader benefits as well. The Champions League may have overtaken international football as the concentrated pinnacle of the game, but with its high‑end regional‑local successes it also feeds directly into Europe's creeping dominance at international level. This is nothing new. The story of the World Cup since 1950 has basically been Western Europe versus Brazil and Argentina. Since 1978 only Diego Maradona's single-handed brilliance has interrupted the Euro-Brazil dynamic, while the last two finals have been all-European affairs. It would be stretching a point however to suggest Spain and Germany have come close to establishing a twin-headed international supremacy: Germany remain curious underachievers given the depth of talent. Semi-finalists in every major competition since 2006, some still&nbsp;lament the absence of the more familiar ugly-football winning edge in these brilliantly mannered academy products. As Hamann says: \"It would be a travesty if this group of players came away without a title.\"</p><p>Argentina, with the La Masia-reared Messi in their ranks, will alongside Brazil provide powerful opposition next year. But Spain and Germany will be massing near the summit whatever happens, with victory in the Americas still the final frontier for Europe's expanding continental dominance.</p><p>Either way the Champions League is all set this week to provide a moment of dignity for what is right now – and by some distance – the concerted Eurozone force in world football: the high‑spec, beautifully engineered, Mercedes Benz‑football of Europe's emergent regional superpowers.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/borussiadortmund\">Borussia Dortmund</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\">Bayern Munich</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/germany\">Germany</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/barneyronay\">Barney Ronay</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Football loves a sweeping narrative and in Bayern v Barça and Dortmund v Real there is a sense of certain shared sporting values that go beyond mere geography, a butterfly print of matching elites from which the committed Rorschach theorist might draw all manner of overheated conclusions. But if the significance of such moments of dominance can often be overstated – exhibit one: the unstoppable rise of the Premier League (sell-by date 2011) – there is still a starkness to this semi-final lineup, a sense of a greater historical ascent in play. Something is happening here. But what, exactly?</p><p>Perhaps the most striking element of this drift towards a Germano-Iberian duopoly is the feeling not of opposed and contrasting superpowers, but of convergence and consensus, of a fraternal similarity. The dawning of the age of Iberia may have been upon us for some time, but in the Bayern supremacy it finds an answering echo: if Germany and Spain are streets ahead when it comes to player development and tactical coherence, they appear to have skipped off around the corner more or less hand-in-hand.</p><p>There will, of course, be some tribal dissent – and to be fair Manchester United were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/05/manchester-united-real-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">smothering Real Madrid into submission before Nani's red card</a> – but it is worth noting the broad consensus is that these are inarguably Europe's top four teams this year. \"It's no coincidence,\" says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DietmarHamann\" title=\"\">Dietmar Hamann</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/may/26/match.acmilan\" title=\"\">winner of this competition with Liverpool in 2005</a>. \"The four best teams are in the semis, which has not really been the case for the last 10 years. They are here because they deserve it and I think all the other teams are behind these. I could see any one of these four winning the Champions League, but I haven't been able to see any of the English teams winning it at any stage this year.\"</p><p>Beyond this the Bundes-Liga semi‑final full-house fits a wider trend. The last four Champions League finals have featured either Barça or Bayern, while eight of the last 12 semi-finalists have been Spanish or German, eclipsing with surprising abruptness a similar run of late-stage hegemony for the Premier League. Albeit, we are of course talking about a small cartel of elite clubs here. The most obvious shared quality, beyond mere nationality, is the sheer scale and reach of three of the four clubs involved, the fiscal and geographical heft of Barcelona, Bayern and Real. These are collectively Europe's ascendant regional superpower clubs, brilliantly marketed to a captive nation-state fanbase and their attendant corporate backers.</p><p>Undoubtedly financial heft is the bedrock of this ascent: in Real and Barcelona the semi-finals host two of the three richest clubs around, and in Bayern the world's most prolific football merchandise machine. You don't have to be a peerless commercial powerhouse to become a part of football's oligarchical elite – but it helps.</p><p>This, though, is about more than just money. It is also a matter of style and content, a set of shared characteristics expressed within the confines of the pitch, and relating to things like tempo and texture and basic notions of how exactly a football team should go about its business. If you were to attempt to define a German and a Spanish style right now you would most likely end up with two differing but also seductively conjoined models. Spain, and in particular Barcelona, are of course the masters of the pass, a method based around the notion of tiny spaces picked apart through relentless high-spec shuttling of the point of possession. The basic approach is to treat the ball as though it is the final bullet in your revolver. This will be a lovingly crafted execution.</p><p>If German teams have a general point of contrast it is perhaps in their greater adherence to Joachim Löw's notion of football as a sport \"defined by a succession of sprints\". Both the national team and Bayern employ direct and purposeful bursts of intelligent movement: not running for runnings's sake, but concerted sprints, either in small pockets or across the pitch. These two nations have taken the basic bonded elements of \"football\" and split them in two: Spain the nation of ball; Germany of the foot.</p><p>These are fine distinctions within the trend of broad similarity. Barcelona at their best are also a team of sprints, particularly in high-pressing defence. Similarly Real Madrid are a great counter-attacking force, with ball-carriers in Angel di María and Cristiano Ronaldo who can match anything Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm might produce. Dortmund swarm around opponents in possession with as much zeal as the original blitz-defence goblins of Catalonia. And Bayern killed the quarter-final by passing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/10/juventus-bayern-munich-match-report\" title=\"\">Juventus to death</a>, Barça-style, as the Italians chased the game.</p><p>It is a promiscuous stylistic overlap, the basic components of which are retention of the ball, hustling defence, attacking at speed when an opponent is destabilised, and a freewheeling approach to traditional formations, the breaking down of positional rigidity into the basic unit of the mobile, mutable modern footballer, able to perform a range of fluid roles.</p><p>It is a similarity that carries through into international football. Germany played the last round of World Cup qualifiers with a Vincente del Bosque (and also Craig Levein)-style 4-6-0 formation, while Löw's <em>Mannschaft</em> have to date managed to make more passes than Spain in the qualifying fixtures.</p><p>The style, the money, the ideologically coherent regional identity. There is a fourth component, too. The evidence suggests a strong spine of home-reared domestic players is what separates the very best from those who merely have the outline, and deep pockets, of a European super-team.

The Chelsea hierarchy supported their captain through his court case over the Anton Ferdinand affair – he was acquitted of racially abusing the QPR defender – and during the subsequent Football Association disciplinary process, dealing with the issue internally once Terry had been fined £220,000 and banned for four matches by the governing body.

And yet, by the end of the match Steffen Freund, prominent throughout in his capering managerial wingman role, could be seen pinching the cheeks of a junior Tottenham ballboy with such celebratory vigour that the ballboy was still rubbing them in discomfort as he walked down the tunnel a few minutes later. Behind him City's players, trudging off the White Hart Lane turf in watery spring sunshine, looked as through they could have done with a pinch or two of their own after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/21/tottenham-manchester-city-match-report\" title=\"\">one of the season's more improbable 3-1 defeats</a>.</p><p>And yet there was something oddly familiar too here, a temptation to see in City's glossily expert capitulation a cartoonish sense of a season in microcosm.

BSkyB is refusing to allow BT to advertise its new sports channels on Sky Sports, and BT has complained to Ofcom. Now leaving aside the fact that BT can (and does) advertise on any of BSkyB's other channels, and that BSkyB and BT have both previously declined advertising from direct competitors – so there is plenty of precedent for BSkyB's position – this dispute really is a storm in a teacup. What lies behind it, however, really couldn't be more serious and the key questions are all for BT.</p><p>BT has spent upwards of £1bn on sports rights – mainly 38 Premier League games a year, top-flight rugby and WTA tennis. When you throw in production and other costs some analysts' estimates put the total bill at nearly £450m annually. Sky has between five and six million sports subscribers and recent history with Setanta and latterly ESPN suggests that maybe a million of them will pay extra for the additional content BT will offer. Of course in addition to recruiting Sky customers BT will hope to attract new subscribers too, but even if it doubles that number to two million, simple arithmetic suggests it would have to charge them close to £30 per month just to cover costs.</p><p>Since no one seriously expects anyone to pay that much just for BT's sports channels – which are still no real match and certainly no substitute for Sky's – some analysts expect BT to lose in excess of £200m a year on them.</p><p>The only way of making sense of this from a BT investor's point of view is to see it not as a loss but as an investment in improving the position of BT's core business – broadband, and especially high-speed broadband. BT has been losing broadband market share to BSkyB – which from a standing start has gone to second in the market behind BT, the legacy operator, in just eight years.</p><p>The sharp end of that battle is the 2.5 million Sky TV customers who currently take their broadband from BT. Were BT to lose them, or even many of them – and on today's trends that could happen – the loss of revenue (line rentals and broadband fees) could top £700m a year. Which is why BT really wants to package up its sports offering with its broadband services. In other words, for BT this is not about sport or even pay-TV, it is about broadband.</p><p>Which brings us back to the current spat over advertising. After Ofcom's pay-TV review, BSkyB faced being compelled to wholesale its premium sports channels to BT at regulated prices. But with no obligation running the other way – on BT to wholesale to BSkyB – BT would then have been in the enviable position of promoting its YouView platform service as the only place to get all Premier League football. And that was the position last year when BT spent its £730m on football rights. But the Competition Appeals Tribunal decision to upend the Ofcom ruling means there is no obligation on BSkyB to wholesale its channels to BT at all.</p><p>BSkyB is now saying it will wholesale its premium sports channels to BT – allowing BT to sell them on to its customers – but only if BT will allow BSkyB the same arrangement with its sports channels. If such an arrangement was agreed, BSkyB would almost certainly drop its objection to BT running adverts on Sky Sports as the rivals would in effect be commercial partners.</p><p>But the problem for BT is that if BSkyB retails BT Sports as part of its offer to its customers, the telecoms company gets the money but not the customers – they belong to Sky.

BSkyB is refusing to allow BT to advertise its new sports channels on Sky Sports, and BT has complained to Ofcom. Now leaving aside the fact that BT can (and does) advertise on any of BSkyB's other channels, and that BSkyB and BT have both previously declined advertising from direct competitors – so there is plenty of precedent for BSkyB's position – this dispute really is a storm in a teacup. What lies behind it, however, really couldn't be more serious and the key questions are all for BT.</p><p>BT has spent upwards of £1bn on sports rights – mainly 38 Premier League games a year, top-flight rugby and WTA tennis. When you throw in production and other costs some analysts' estimates put the total bill at nearly £450m annually. Sky has between five and six million sports subscribers and recent history with Setanta and latterly ESPN suggests that maybe a million of them will pay extra for the additional content BT will offer. Of course in addition to recruiting Sky customers BT will hope to attract new subscribers too, but even if it doubles that number to two million, simple arithmetic suggests it would have to charge them close to £30 per month just to cover costs.</p><p>Since no one seriously expects anyone to pay that much just for BT's sports channels – which are still no real match and certainly no substitute for Sky's – some analysts expect BT to lose in excess of £200m a year on them.</p><p>The only way of making sense of this from a BT investor's point of view is to see it not as a loss but as an investment in improving the position of BT's core business – broadband, and especially high-speed broadband. BT has been losing broadband market share to BSkyB – which from a standing start has gone to second in the market behind BT, the legacy operator, in just eight years.</p><p>The sharp end of that battle is the 2.5 million Sky TV customers who currently take their broadband from BT. Were BT to lose them, or even many of them – and on today's trends that could happen – the loss of revenue (line rentals and broadband fees) could top £700m a year. Which is why BT really wants to package up its sports offering with its broadband services. In other words, for BT this is not about sport or even pay-TV, it is about broadband.</p><p>Which brings us back to the current spat over advertising. After Ofcom's pay-TV review, BSkyB faced being compelled to wholesale its premium sports channels to BT at regulated prices. But with no obligation running the other way – on BT to wholesale to BSkyB – BT would then have been in the enviable position of promoting its YouView platform service as the only place to get all Premier League football. And that was the position last year when BT spent its £730m on football rights. But the Competition Appeals Tribunal decision to upend the Ofcom ruling means there is no obligation on BSkyB to wholesale its channels to BT at all.</p><p>BSkyB is now saying it will wholesale its premium sports channels to BT – allowing BT to sell them on to its customers – but only if BT will allow BSkyB the same arrangement with its sports channels. If such an arrangement was agreed, BSkyB would almost certainly drop its objection to BT running adverts on Sky Sports as the rivals would in effect be commercial partners.</p><p>But the problem for BT is that if BSkyB retails BT Sports as part of its offer to its customers, the telecoms company gets the money but not the customers – they belong to Sky. And no customer data means no capacity to try to sell them broadband packages. Which defeats the strategic point of spending £1bn on sports rights. Which could lead investors to wonder what else BT might have done with all that cash.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bt-sport\">BT Sport</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bt-vision\">BT Vision</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television\">Television industry</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/btgroup\">BT</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bskyb\">BSkyB</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/britishskybroadcastinggroup\">BSkyB</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevehewlett\">Steve Hewlett</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It may well prove Suárez's final act of the season after he again showed his appetite for controversy by sinking his teeth into Branislav Ivanovic.</p><p>The Liverpool striker, supposedly a favourite for the PFA Player of the Year award according to his manager, Brendan Rodgers, bit the Chelsea defender on the bicep as the pair challenged for the ball in front of the Kop on 66 minutes. Suárez left Dutch football in disgrace after receiving a seven-match ban for biting Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax against PSV Eindhoven in November 2010.</p><p>Another lengthy suspension surely awaits the Uruguay international who, almost inevitably when he should have been off the pitch, headed Daniel Sturridge's cross beyond Petr Cech with the final touch of a fractious game to dent Chelsea's hopes of reclaiming third spot.</p><p>Benítez was not the only subject of an Anfield tribute. Anne Williams, the inspirational Hillsborough campaigner who died on Thursday, three days after defying doctor's orders to attend the 24th memorial service, and the victims of the Boston marathon bombing were honoured with a minute's ovation before kick off. 'RIP Anne You'll Never Walk Alone' read the banner along the front of the Kop.</p><p>Amid the shows of respect were predictable Kop jeers for Fernando Torres whenever the former Liverpool striker touched the ball or left his mark on their central defence. Daniel Agger landed awkwardly after a nudge from the Chelsea forward in the second minute, and was fortunate his left knee did not buckle, while Jamie Carragher received a flailing arm in the face when challenging for a high ball. Torres received a yellow card and, later on, a little retribution on the back of his calf.</p><p>Liverpool, despite a promising start, appeared preoccupied with the Benítez sideshow in the first half and their distribution, movement and solidity paled in comparison with that from Chelsea. The midfield contest was not worthy of the name as Ramires and Mikel John Obi intercepted and protected relentlessly while Oscar, Juan Mata and Eden Hazard bypassed Liverpool with ease. Carelessness in possession, with Jordan Henderson a frequent culprit, increased Anfield's irritation.</p><p>It was a surprise Chelsea led by only one set-piece goal by the interval. Oscar sent a glancing header beyond Pepe Reina's left hand from Mata's corner having escaped the attentions of both Agger, his initial marker, and Carragher, the defender covering the edge of the six-yard box. Reina almost compounded Liverpool's defensive brittleness when he dropped a David Luiz free-kick behind him, only to gather in front of the line.</p><p>Liverpool threatened only sporadically, Suárez forcing a routine save from Cech at the near post, and it was only after Sturridge replaced the anonymous Philippe Coutinho at the interval that Rodgers' team hauled themselves back into contention.</p><p>Sturridge was a man on a mission, creating a glorious chance for Steven Gerrard seconds after his introduction that Cech saved with his leg and then hitting the post with a venomous drive moments later. His inevitable goal arrived seven minutes after his introduction when he volleyed home from close range following a flowing Liverpool move involving Carragher, Stewart Downing and finally a wonderful chip over the Chelsea defence from Suárez.</p><p>The Uruguay international's afternoon, however, soon nose-dived. Three minutes later Suárez handled Mata's corner and denied Torres a header at the back post. The referee, Kevin Friend, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Hazard sent Reina the wrong way following a lengthy delay due to the usual arguments.</p><p>For reasons known only to himself Suárez then sank his teeth into Ivanovic as the pair tussled in front of the Kop. He may have then scored the last-gasp equaliser, but another stain on the Liverpool striker's character and a lengthy ban will surely follow.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andyhunter\">Andy Hunter</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Suárez left Dutch football in disgrace after receiving a seven-match ban for biting Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax against PSV Eindhoven in November 2010.</p><p>Another lengthy suspension surely awaits the Uruguay international who, almost inevitably when he should have been off the pitch, headed Daniel Sturridge's cross beyond Petr Cech with the final touch of a fractious game to dent Chelsea's hopes of reclaiming third spot.</p><p>Benítez was not the only subject of an Anfield tribute. Anne Williams, the inspirational Hillsborough campaigner who died on Thursday, three days after defying doctor's orders to attend the 24th memorial service, and the victims of the Boston marathon bombing were honoured with a minute's ovation before kick off. 'RIP Anne You'll Never Walk Alone' read the banner along the front of the Kop.</p><p>Amid the shows of respect were predictable Kop jeers for Fernando Torres whenever the former Liverpool striker touched the ball or left his mark on their central defence. Daniel Agger landed awkwardly after a nudge from the Chelsea forward in the second minute, and was fortunate his left knee did not buckle, while Jamie Carragher received a flailing arm in the face when challenging for a high ball. Torres received a yellow card and, later on, a little retribution on the back of his calf.</p><p>Liverpool, despite a promising start, appeared preoccupied with the Benítez sideshow in the first half and their distribution, movement and solidity paled in comparison with that from Chelsea. The midfield contest was not worthy of the name as Ramires and Mikel John Obi intercepted and protected relentlessly while Oscar, Juan Mata and Eden Hazard bypassed Liverpool with ease. Carelessness in possession, with Jordan Henderson a frequent culprit, increased Anfield's irritation.</p><p>It was a surprise Chelsea led by only one set-piece goal by the interval. Oscar sent a glancing header beyond Pepe Reina's left hand from Mata's corner having escaped the attentions of both Agger, his initial marker, and Carragher, the defender covering the edge of the six-yard box. Reina almost compounded Liverpool's defensive brittleness when he dropped a David Luiz free-kick behind him, only to gather in front of the line.</p><p>Liverpool threatened only sporadically, Suárez forcing a routine save from Cech at the near post, and it was only after Sturridge replaced the anonymous Philippe Coutinho at the interval that Rodgers' team hauled themselves back into contention.</p><p>Sturridge was a man on a mission, creating a glorious chance for Steven Gerrard seconds after his introduction that Cech saved with his leg and then hitting the post with a venomous drive moments later. His inevitable goal arrived seven minutes after his introduction when he volleyed home from close range following a flowing Liverpool move involving Carragher, Stewart Downing and finally a wonderful chip over the Chelsea defence from Suárez.</p><p>The Uruguay international's afternoon, however, soon nose-dived. Three minutes later Suárez handled Mata's corner and denied Torres a header at the back post. The referee, Kevin Friend, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Hazard sent Reina the wrong way following a lengthy delay due to the usual arguments.</p><p>For reasons known only to himself Suárez then sank his teeth into Ivanovic as the pair tussled in front of the Kop. He may have then scored the last-gasp equaliser, but another stain on the Liverpool striker's character and a lengthy ban will surely follow.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andyhunter\">Andy Hunter</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Both sets of wide players came inside quickly, while Edin Dzeko and Emmanuel Adebayor were largely isolated up front.</p><p>The major difference was the player \"in the hole\" on either side. Spurs used the fit-again Gareth Bale, who received the ball in dangerous positions in the opening moments, but gradually found his space restricted as City remained compact. With Clint Dempsey and, in particular, Gylfi Sigurdsson moving inside, City defended narrow and Bale was crowded out.</p><p>At the other end, Carlos Tevez showed greater positional intelligence throughout the first half, positioning himself between the lines, and constantly drifting to the flanks to overload Tottenham in wide areas. His pass to James Milner in the build-up to Samir Nasri's opener was sublime, and the Argentine also created chances for Nasri and Dzeko with clever touches after finding himself unmarked.</p><p>Villas-Boas made a subtle change at half-time: Bale swapping with Dempsey and moving to the right flank. This unwittingly played into City's hands, however – Roberto Mancini had been forced to replace the injured Milner with Aleksandar Kolarov, who went to the left flank. In tandem with Gaël Clichy, City shut down Bale's space easily.</p><p>After an hour, Villas-Boas changed things more dramatically, moving from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3. Tom Huddlestone replaced Parker and sat solidly in the holding role, tracking Tevez across the pitch, and spraying some excellent forward passes into attack.

Both sets of wide players came inside quickly, while Edin Dzeko and Emmanuel Adebayor were largely isolated up front.</p><p>The major difference was the player \"in the hole\" on either side. Spurs used the fit-again Gareth Bale, who received the ball in dangerous positions in the opening moments, but gradually found his space restricted as City remained compact. With Clint Dempsey and, in particular, Gylfi Sigurdsson moving inside, City defended narrow and Bale was crowded out.</p><p>At the other end, Carlos Tevez showed greater positional intelligence throughout the first half, positioning himself between the lines, and constantly drifting to the flanks to overload Tottenham in wide areas. His pass to James Milner in the build-up to Samir Nasri's opener was sublime, and the Argentine also created chances for Nasri and Dzeko with clever touches after finding himself unmarked.</p><p>Villas-Boas made a subtle change at half-time: Bale swapping with Dempsey and moving to the right flank. This unwittingly played into City's hands, however – Roberto Mancini had been forced to replace the injured Milner with Aleksandar Kolarov, who went to the left flank. In tandem with Gaël Clichy, City shut down Bale's space easily.</p><p>After an hour, Villas-Boas changed things more dramatically, moving from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3. Tom Huddlestone replaced Parker and sat solidly in the holding role, tracking Tevez across the pitch, and spraying some excellent forward passes into attack. Meanwhile, Lewis Holtby replaced Sigurdsson, and alongside Dembélé helped overpower Barry and Touré with sheer energy.</p><p>Once Jermain Defoe had replaced the ineffectual Adebayor 10 minutes later, Spurs were playing in a completely different fashion. Their first half attacks were slow and involved various players crowding the centre – now, with Bale higher up the pitch and looking for balls in behind, an approach Defoe instinctively replicated, they could attack directly at speed. Forward passes were combined with clever runs, and Spurs were superb for the final 20 minutes and Mancini failed to respond tactically.</p><p>With Spurs in a powerful 4-3-3 and Bale out on the right, cutting inside on to his left foot in the manner of Brazilian forward Hulk, Spurs were reminiscent of Villas-Boas's Porto side that won the Portuguese league unbeaten and the Europa League in 2010-11.</p><p>The impression that Tottenham have rediscovered their 'vertical' style of play, the fact that Villas-Boas himself was a crucial part of the victory, and the small matter of three points against a quality side at such a crucial stage of the season, means this win might one day be considered pivotal in Spurs' evolution under their Portuguese tactician.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-tactics\">Football tactics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cox\">Michael Cox</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Inspired by Gareth Bale and three highly effective substitutions by André Villas-Boas, Tottenham scored three goals in seven minutes to reignite a top-four dream that appeared to have faded.</p><p>As Villas-Boas looked ahead to Tottenham's final five matches, with the decisive one to come at Chelsea, Mancini was left to reflect on his players' desire, which he suggested had to be the problem as there was nothing to choose between them and United in technical terms.</p><p>\"We don't have a gap [to United],\" said Mancini, the City manager. \"The last two or three years … every time we have played United, we have played better, also when we have lost the game. We lost in the last minute [earlier in the season]. Last year, we beat them easily. The reason there is a gap like today [in the league] … probably there is more attitude, they wanted. They started the season and they wanted to win after last year. There are many reasons why we lose but I repeat, they deserve to win it.\"</p><p>Mancini was asked whether he thought City had gifted Untied the title. \"Sometimes, we probably did,\" he replied. \"I&nbsp;think the 13- or 15-point gap is not reality for this championship. They are not a better team but they deserve to win this title because we lost a lot of points in games we probably didn't deserve to lose. United won a lot of games in a row with goals and they deserve to win the title.</p><p>\"The race was finished three or four weeks ago. Will I watch the Villa game? If&nbsp;I am at home, why not? It will mean nothing to us. We wanted to win this championship. What can we do? We can maybe say only congratulations to them. When you win, you deserve to win it. You&nbsp;always need a bit of luck in football. It is like life.&nbsp;But they did not win by luck. They had a better attitude because they lost last year.\"</p><p>Mancini appeared to revisit an old grievance when he spoke of United buying \"some new players in the summer and they scored a lot of goals.\" He had been determined to sign the striker Robin Van Persie from Arsenal, only for the Dutchman to join United and deliver 21 league goals so far this season.</p><p>\"I'm not happy because I like to win the championship,\" Mancini added. \"This was our target. I'm not happy with the season because I want always the maximum. But we have another chance to win the FA Cup and I think the FA Cup is important. And we can be in second position. If that is not good enough, then every manager should be sacked.\"</p><p>Villas-Boas highlighted Clint Dempsey's 75th minute equaliser as the turning point and he said that his players' confidence had been restored. \"We still have to reach our objectives for this season to be considered a full success,\" he said. \"Hopefully we are able to achieve it. We are in control because we have the game in hand but it is against Chelsea, and it's a difficult game at Stamford Bridge.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/roberto-mancini\">Roberto Mancini</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They had a better attitude because they lost last year.\"</p><p>Mancini appeared to revisit an old grievance when he spoke of United buying \"some new players in the summer and they scored a lot of goals.\" He had been determined to sign the striker Robin Van Persie from Arsenal, only for the Dutchman to join United and deliver 21 league goals so far this season.</p><p>\"I'm not happy because I like to win the championship,\" Mancini added. \"This was our target. I'm not happy with the season because I want always the maximum. But we have another chance to win the FA Cup and I think the FA Cup is important. And we can be in second position. If that is not good enough, then every manager should be sacked.\"</p><p>Villas-Boas highlighted Clint Dempsey's 75th minute equaliser as the turning point and he said that his players' confidence had been restored. \"We still have to reach our objectives for this season to be considered a full success,\" he said. \"Hopefully we are able to achieve it. We are in control because we have the game in hand but it is against Chelsea, and it's a difficult game at Stamford Bridge.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/roberto-mancini\">Roberto Mancini</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur\">Tottenham Hotspur</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
