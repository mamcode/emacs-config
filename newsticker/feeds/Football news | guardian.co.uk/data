Ferguson, who felt that his team had stood up like champions, suggested that the referee, Lee Probert, was not strong enough, but his West Ham counterpart, Sam Allardyce, also tore into the officials.</p><p>Television replays showed that Robin van Persie was in an offside position when Shinji Kagawa's 77th-minute shot hit both posts before breaking for the striker to score United's second equaliser of the evening. The assistant referee Harry Lennard did not flag. Allardyce said that West Ham had been robbed of a \"famous victory\" and in the row over Carroll's challenge on De Gea, he took issue with Ferguson.</p><p>\"It was a red card, there is no doubt about that,\" Ferguson said. \"The referee did see it but he didn't see it as a red card. We know how West Ham play, it's ball-in-the-air most of the time and you've got to defend those things. They are very, very aggressive as we've seen tonight. You hope there's a strong referee. I'm not so sure we got that tonight.</p><p>\"We had to stand up to a lot there but we kept going, our players, down twice, came back . They played like champions. They were magnificent in terms of determination and courage to play, so I was pleased with the result.\"</p><p>Allardyce was not. \"Can I get my anger out first?\" he said. \"This was a famous victory for us and when we play like that and score one of the best goals of the season [through Mohamed Diamé] ... the job of the assistant referee is to give the decision. Van Persie is two yards offside.</p><p>\"He has taken a famous victory from us. To draw this game by default is a bitter pill to swallow. We were outstanding. If my players make those mistakes, they get dropped, so should they. Our fans [should] go home with 41 points, knowing that we are safe. There is £60m, £70m, £80m riding on it.</p><p>\"This level of football has to be equalled by the level of the officials. [Lennard's] coaches have to coach him properly and coach him into getting better – that is why they are professional these days.\"</p><p>Carroll said that he had gone for the ball in the collision that left De Gea poleaxed. \"I was running straight in and I couldn't stop at that moment,\" he said. Allardyce backed him up, with a nod towards the stopping distances in the Highway Code.</p><p>\"As you'll know from your code, when you are travelling at 60mph, it takes 300 yards to stop,\" he said. \"When Andy is travelling at 15mph, he can't stop. I don't agree [with Ferguson]. It was a yellow at worst. You can't commit for a header and then suddenly stop. We're just bitterly disappointed with the result, although it's another precious point against the team who are going to be champions.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chilean, who has coached at Real Madrid and enjoyed a successful spell with Villarreal, took Málaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League this term despite continuing financial problems at the Spanish club, before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/09/borussia-dortmund-malaga-champions-league\" title=\"\">they lost to Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p><p>The 59-year-old speaks good English and is renowned as a disciplinarian who has implemented a brand of attractive, attacking football. His contract with Málaga expires at the end of next season but includes a buy-out clause believed to be set at around £3.4m, though it remains to be seen whether he can be persuaded to swap Spain for Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Chelsea, who appointed Benítez on a seven-month contract to succeed Roberto Di Matteo, intend to make a formal offer to their preferred candidate only once it is clear whether they have qualified for the Champions League. They are sounding out potential managers, with Pellegrini high on their shortlist.</p><p>José Mourinho is another possibility and has made clear his desire to return to London if, as expected, he leaves Real Madrid in the summer. David Moyes, whose contract at Everton expires in June, and the Atlético Madrid coach, Diego Simeone, have also made an impression, while Gianfranco Zola's progress at Watford has been noted even if these remain early&nbsp;days in the Italian's managerial career.</p><p>Benítez's hopes of leaving Chelsea with Champions League football were boosted by a first away success in the league since mid-January, the recalled John Terry scoring twice to defeat Fulham and remind the interim manager of his qualities. Regardless, the former England captain is likely to return to the bench for Sunday's trip to Liverpool. \"The important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"Every player wants to play every game, but they have to realise they can't do that and be 100% in each game.</p><p>\"As for the Champions League, I said a long time ago that the race for the top four would go until the end for the season. It'll be like this and I don't think any of the clubs up there, including Everton, is out of it. Things can change with every game. We have to keep winning our games and keep going.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/malaga\">Málaga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/laligafootball\">La Liga</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They also remember precisely what they said. On 14 May 1995, a spring's afternoon at Upton Park and Andy Cole, confronted by Ludek Miklosko, has the last-gasp chance to win the Premier League title for United. \"Just lift it, Andy,\" they shouted. Or words to that effect. But Cole hits it low at Miklosko, who saves. United draw and Blackburn Rovers are the champions.</p><p>That was when title races were title races, when they went to the wire or, at the very least, made it into May. United's canter to their 20th championship has been a very different story, one that has been marked by a remarkable absence of stress. The demons of Upton Park will always gnaw away at Sir Alex Ferguson but when they threatened to reappear here, after West Ham United scored wonderful goals, United swatted them away. The truth was that even a defeat would hardly have mattered.</p><p>United have come to trade in extreme end-of-season luxuries. Their target now is not only to win but to do so in historic style and despite these dropped points, they could still better Chelsea's record 95 points from 2004-05. When they stand to be crowned is also on the agenda. It could be on Sunday week at Arsenal, which would be particularly sweet for Robin van Persie. United roll on, remorselessly.</p><p>West Ham have enjoyed their own sort of comfort this season. The script for newly promoted teams, particularly those that wriggle up via the play-offs, calls for frayed nerves and regular dips in and out of the relegation plunge pool. But West Ham, perhaps surprisingly for a club with a recent addiction to chaos, have remained above the relegation battle, barely once being mentioned as candidates to slip down.</p><p>Allardyce merits credit for overseeing the steadiness. Before the play-off final against Blackpool at the end of his first season in charge, there had been the genuine feeling among the West Ham support that he should be sacked if the team lost. But he got the job done and these days he has the fans' acceptance, at the very least, if not their outright love for his style.</p><p>If many of his players fit a particular profile, they are certainly united behind him. They talk glowingly of his attention to detail and it was evident in his set-up here, in a tactical duel that he would have relished against his hero Ferguson. He pushed Mohamed Diamé and Kevin Nolan high on to United's defensive midfielders, Phil Jones and Michael Carrick, and his team carried the fight. Allardyce has made West Ham competitive.</p><p>United expected an aerial bombardment and balls up to Andy Carroll were a feature of the West Ham strategy. The tall striker put it about with Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and, shudderingly so, David De Gea.</p><p>Ferguson jabbed his finger as he advanced his protest to the fourth official, Andre Marriner, after De Gea had been cleaned out by Carroll following a 45th-minute corner.</p><p>The home team's finesse, though, was apparent, whether in Carroll's early threaded shot that kissed the outside of the far post or the sight of Ricardo Vaz Te tricking outrageously out of a tight spot inside his own area. Their opening goal was not bad, when they broke from the edge of their box. There was the drive of Diamé; a stop-start move from Matt Jarvis to flummox Ferdinand; Carroll's aerial power and Vaz Te's anticipation. And the second, from Diamé's left-footed curler, was a peach.</p><p>Carroll's future is a pressing issue for West Ham and his all-action display provided further evidence as to why. His willingness to battle against the hardest centre-halfs not only endears him to supporters. His team-mates relish the out-ball to him and his hold-up work allows them to squeeze up the pitch. His loan from Liverpool expires at the end of the season and Allardyce has suggested that his wage demands, allied to financial fair play, could make it impossible to make the move permanent.</p><p>And what of Allardyce, who has still to sign his contract extension? The club maintain that there will be no problems, that it is merely a matter of time and yet it has dragged and Allardyce says that he has to be sure of his ability to compete in the summer transfer market before he commits. There has also been the notion that he has wanted to wait until West Ham have 40 points. That could happen here on Saturday against Wigan.</p><p>United's focus was formidable. It has sustained them this season and on each occasion that they fell behind their response bristled with conviction. Shinji Kagawa's balance to tee up Antonio Valencia's goal was beautiful and the second equaliser had been extensively trailed, even if Van Persie might have been marginally offside before he struck his 25th of the season. There was no dramatic finale for United. The job had been done.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It goes without saying that one club will drop points.</p><p>Ramsey, though, is focused on what Arsenal have to do and he says that if they can win at Fulham on Saturday, to end a key week with seven points from an available nine, they would be in a commanding position. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/13/arsenal-norwich-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal beat Norwich City at home last Saturday</a> and the draw against Everton extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to five matches.</p><p>\"It was important for us not to lose against Everton and we still have a lot of confidence,\" Ramsey said. \"We were quite nervous in the first half and our final ball let us down but, overall, we were quite solid. We're looking forward to the weekend. Tottenham and Chelsea still have to play each other. They still have tough games. The teams are still going to drop points so we're positive and confident that we can finish in the top four.</p><p>\"We always knew that this week was going to be a big week for us and hopefully now we can finish it off strongly and get a win at Fulham. That would put us in a really strong position.\"</p><p>Ramsey has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks and it is no coincidence that he is back to playing in central midfield. \"I'm delighted with the way I'm playing and how the team is playing,\" he said. \"It makes a big difference [being in central midfield]. That's my position and that's where I want to play.</p><p>\"At the beginning of the season, I was moving all over the pitch, playing left-wing, right-wing, right-back. I was asked to do a job in many positions, which I'm happy to do for the team. If the manager wants me to play there, I'm not going to say no to that. But I've got my place back in the middle and my performances have been showing what I'm capable of doing there.\"</p><p>The Football Association will take no action following the fracas between Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Everton's Kevin Mirallas on Tuesday. The pair clashed in the tunnel at half-time but the governing body is satisfied that it was nothing serious.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal\">Arsenal</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Wenger complained that the referee, Neil Swarbrick, had failed to dismiss Darron Gibson for a series of fouls in a fractious first half, and claimed the Merseysiders had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/arsenal-arsene-wenger-everton\" title=\"\">gone \"over the edge\" throughout</a> with their challenges in seeking to snuff out Arsenal's threat.</p><p>Asked if Everton had been particularly keen to unnerve their hosts, Baines said: \"It was not something that we'd spoken about. Wherever we go, the team we're up against know that they will be in for a game against us. The workrate the players put in is there to be seen. We are not a side people enjoy playing against at any level: we have a little bit about the team. We have workrate and ethic, and the togetherness and team spirit are inspirational at times.</p><p>\"Sometimes I look around and I can't believe what some people are doing, the effort they are putting in, people going above and beyond and playing with injuries. It is inspirational to see how hard they work. Mixed with the quality we have and show, we can't be an easy team to play against. This game was very bitty and scrappy in the first half, with both sides conceding fouls and giving the ball away, but I don't think they can have any complaints about the physical side of it. I don't think there was anything [over the top] in the whole game.\"</p><p>The draw left Everton four points from Arsenal and still chasing Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea for the last two Champions League places. \"We are definitely the outsiders,\" added the England defender. \"The other sides are teams who people would back to beat us to those positions, but we won't give up on it. We will keep trying to win games. We go to Sunderland and then have a home game [against Fulham], and if we can get six points from the next two games let's see what everyone else does. We can try and keep up the pressure, keep winning and keep ourselves in the mix. You never know. We might just nick it.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton\">Everton</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I have lost count how many games I used to go with him on a Tuesday night against some team, [with Dad] pulling me to the side, leaving 10 minutes before the end, and saying we would never go back.\"</p><p>\"Then on the Saturday we would be there again. For him to see that [promotion party], and for his son to play a part in that, makes it even more special. It hit home to me a little bit as well. He said he will die a happy man.\"</p><p>With Cardiff joining Swansea in the Premier League – the first time Wales has had two top-flight clubs – <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/blog/2013/apr/17/cardiff-city-promotion-premier-league-swansea\" title=\"\">Bellamy predicted there will be wider benefits</a> for the capital city and the country as a whole. \"The knock-on effect it can have on the national team, for young players coming through, this makes it so much more special as well,\" he said. \"We've seen what it has done for Swansea, we have seen what it has done for the city and the money it has brought in as well. We are the capital city, we are Cardiff City. What it will do for us will be immense and the knock-on effect it will have for Welsh football will only be positive.\"</p><p>Bellamy hailed Malky Mackay's contribution as manager as \"immense\" and said that, combined with the backing of the club's Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan, Cardiff have the perfect platform to achieve further success. \"Malky has really pushed us forward with his professionalism. Financially this club is going to grow and with him at the helm it will allow us to do it in the right manner. Hopefully there will be no limit to what he can succeed.\"</p><p>Asked about Cardiff's chances in the Premier League, Bellamy said: \"It is going to be a completely different stage. Are we going to sign players? I don't know. I've got to look after myself as well, so I hope we don't sign too many players, especially on the left wing. I don't think we need players there! No, of course we do. We need strength in depth everywhere but that is between the manager and owner.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/craig-bellamy\">Craig Bellamy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chelsea have thrust their way back into the Premier League's top three, eclipsing Fulham at a canter with players whose days at the club appear to be numbered thriving in the familiarity of a derby. Those crammed into the Putney End will have found reassurance in the sight of Frank Lampard and, in particular, John Terry excelling. This was a throwback, a saunter to enjoy on the banks of the Thames.</p><p>Both the veterans had sat out Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, a watershed given the significance of that occasion and the reality they have been permanent fixtures on the bigger stages when fit. The sheer weight of games has forced each into Rafael Benítez's policy of rotation though Lampard, his contract drifting to its conclusion, and Terry have started to feel more second-string than first-choice.</p><p>The 60th game of Chelsea's season offered a reminder of their qualities. When the team sought strength they rallied, albeit against opponents too wasteful to inflict their own wounds. A first away win in the league since mid-January was timely given the fixture clutter.</p><p>Lampard oozed calm authority on his 600th appearance for the club, even if he still seeks the two goals to equal Bobby Tambling's club record of 202. It was Terry who registered twice here, a header in either half puncturing Fulham's resistance, the captain ending the contest bare-chested and celebrating in front of the away support. \"I'm really pleased with his performance, but the most important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"They all know that. The players have to be ready to perform and on their toes every game.\" With Gary Cahill close to a return from a knee injury, Terry's alternate selections may well be prolonged but, regardless, he can make his mark on the run-in.</p><p>Benítez had required his captain's strong-arm presence here. The reality is Chelsea had needed a spark to ignite what had initially been another understandably leggy display. Fulham had created the early opportunities, Dimitar Berbatov orchestrating their play, with the visitors limited to flurries of possession before David Luiz tired of all the pretty approach-play. He collected the ball some 30 yards out and with Bryan Ruiz too half-hearted in his attempt to close him down, lashed a shot which caught the wind gusting around the arena and careered beyond Mark Schwarzer into the top corner.</p><p>It was a staggering goal to pep the visitors' resolve. Half-time was close when Lampard belted a free-kick from distance and tapped into the same flight path, the ball swerving in mid-air and thudding into Schwarzer's chest before dribbling behind. Fulham never recovered their composure from the resultant corner, Juan Mata eventually floating a deep cross to the far post where Terry leapt unchallengedbetween Sascha Riether and Philippe Senderos to power a header into the net.</p><p>That lead was never likely to be properly challenged thereafter, Chelsea's composure established. For all Fulham's huff and puff, there was little surprise when the revitalised Fernando Torres flicked on a corner and Terry, from virtually on the goal-line, nodded in a second 19 minutes from time.</p><p>Fulham stewed in their frustration. They are not used to yielding to their local rivals so readily in this arena, with this a first defeat in four years, though the exasperation was born more of an inability to take their own chances. Martin Jol's side had forged the clearer opportunities when the game was goalless only to be blunted by profligacy.</p><p>The tone had been set in the opening attack Riether – a player Jol hopes to secure on a long-term basis from Cologne in the summer after an excellent season on loan – crossing beyond David Luiz only for Ruiz, alone in front of goal, to poke an awkward volley over the bar.

That was until the 83rd minute when Aleksandar Kolarov fed Carlos Tevez whose finish from 20 yards came as a right-foot bullet which the visiting goalkeeper, Joel Robles, found impossible to stop.</p><p>That signalled the end of this phase of Wigan Athletic's relegation-dodging escape act that had previously yielded seven points from three games. As Manchester United drew at Upton Park, Tevez's winner made it a productive night for City – Roberto Mancini having previously stated their mission is to confirm second place and reduce the deficit to United.</p><p>City are now 13 points behind with a game in hand. For Mancini, this prompted a joke about Robin van Persie's contested late equaliser at West Ham. \"If they didn't score an offside probably we were nine [points behind if they win their extra game],\" he said.</p><p>There was a more mixed message for the returning Micah Richards whose serious knee injury had kept him out since 27 October. \"I'm happy because he came back to play but I thought that he was in better form because he trained and because we know true Richards,\" Mancini said. \"For this reason I think that he needs to work a lot. He played for 10 minutes, after [that] he went down because it's normal after six months. It's impossible he can play well for 70 minutes.\"</p><p>Wigan are now three points adrift of Aston Villa, Stoke City and Sunderland though they have also played one fewer match. \"I see it going down to the final game, we are playing Aston Villa,\" Roberto Martínez said. \"We talk about six pointers and it does not get bigger than that. That is something we would be happy about from where we came from but we have a lot of games before that.\"</p><p>City's recent displays in beating United and knocking Chelsea out of the FA Cup to reach the final had been evidence of a late-season return to form. Here, they took a while to wake from a soporific opening until the scoreboard flashed up that United had gone 1-0 down.</p><p>Suddenly Yaya Touré could be spied marauding through the middle, then Richards surged into space down the right but had strayed offside.</p><p>Next up, Sergio Agüero, playing to the left of the City trident behind the lone striker Tevez, made life awkward for Emmerson Boyce and Paul Scharner and flipped over a cross that was unlucky not to be met by a team-mate.</p><p>City, though, had to bless their fortune as Wigan, in their most convincing passage of play, pinned them back and in front of Joe Hart's goal Kolarov had to be alert to make a skied clearance that could have gone anywhere.</p><p>Next Arouna Koné's touch failed him when he had only Hart to beat – and the keeper then had to throw out his arms and legs in a star jump to save from Franco Di Santo after some slick footwork created an opening. Moments later Richards was forced to upend the same player as Di Santo looked to split the defence and the right-back was booked. To the relief of the home fans Wigan's free-kick was hit over the wall by the impressive Shaun Maloney and straight into Hart's hands.</p><p>Agüero, who scored the clinching goal in the 2-1 win over Chelsea at Wembley, did not emerge for the second half and was replaced by Edin Dzeko in a City reshuffle that switched to a three-man defence. If Mancini was hoping this new formation would galvanise his team he had to watch when, with hart beaten, Joleon Lescott positioned himself superbly to clear off the line from Maloney.</p><p>Just before the hour the Italian changed his personnel again. Javi García came off for James Milner as his manager reverted to his original back four, with Samir Nasri switching to the left wing and the England amidfielder taking his place on the right.</p><p>Sensing someone should wrest the initiative, Tevez blazed wide with only Robles to beat. While there were further chances for each side but no goals until the striker's pivotal intervention.</p><p>Mancini, who rested Gaël Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta and Matija Nastasic, believes Wigan will survive. \"They don't deserve to be relegated,\" he said. \"For 60 minutes they played better than us.\"</p><p>He and Martínez had perhaps been correct to suggest that no implications could be drawn from the contest regarding the Cup final. But, if it is as entertaining as this one, 11 May should be an invigorating occasion.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiejackson\">Jamie Jackson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sir Alex Ferguson's men twice had to come from behind but this is the resilience that is taking them to their 20th league championship and, in that context, they will not mind too much that their late, dramatic search for a winner could not concoct a decisive goal.</p><p>The damage is only superficial when a team have their advantage at the top of the league and, though the gap is trimmed to 13 points to Manchester City, everything still points to the game at Arsenal on Sunday week as the moment when they can confirm the handover. For Robin van Persie, the scorer of their 77th-minute equaliser, it must be a sweet prospect.</p><p>Van Persie had been offside for his goal and Sam Allardyce lamented at some length afterwards about the injustice his team has suffered. West Ham United took the lead in the 17th minute when Ricardo Vaz&nbsp;Tê finished a move that had begun on the edge of their own penalty area and the goal from Mohamed Diamé, 10 minutes into the second half, was one of the outstanding moments Upton Park has witnessed this season. In between, Antonio Valencia had scored his first goal of the season but the champions-elect had looked flat for long spells, with Wayne Rooney enduring a difficult and undistinguished night, and it was only after Van Persie's goal that West Ham suddenly looked vulnerable. Allardyce can complain too often about match officials but on this occasion he had a point.</p><p>The West Ham manager was not alone, though, in harbouring a few grievances, Ferguson arguing that Andy Carroll deserved an \"obvious red card\" for the flying leap into David de Gea that poleaxed the goalkeeper in the first half. Carroll had been a difficult opponent for the league leaders, particularly in the opening hour, when it was not just his size that the opposition defence found awkward to handle but his movement and ability to bring others into the game.</p><p>He was booked in the second half for a far more innocuous tussle with De Gea but the way the Spaniard handled the earlier battering was another reflection of United's durability this season. De Gea may not have suffered a more crashing challenge since arriving in England, even going back to those periods when opposition teams would routinely try to rough him up. Yet the Spaniard is no soft touch these days and it was telling how Ferguson's players did not feel it necessary to back him up when he gave a little back in the second half. De Gea can fight his own battles now.</p><p>Ferguson, however, was entitled to object and it was difficult afterwards to know which manager was the most annoyed. Both had legitimate grievances but Allardyce was right to say the lack of offside against Van Persie had the greater consequences. Kagawa's shot had flicked off James Collins and ricocheted off one post to the other. Van Persie turned in the loose ball, putting away a finish that was probably harder than he made it look, but it was an unmistakably bad call from the assistant referee. Allardyce described it as an \"easy&nbsp;decision\".</p><p>West Ham had to repel some concerted pressure for the remainder of the match, Ferguson's players passing the ball with greater speed and penetration. Yet the lingering memory will be what happened in the 55thminute after Vaz Tê and Guy&nbsp;Demel worked a little passing triangle with Diamé near the right-hand corner of the penalty area. The turn from Diamé to&nbsp;spin away from Rooney was wonderful in its own right. The curling left-foot shot, struck with equal measures of power and&nbsp;precision, made it a goal of sumptuous quality.</p><p>Vaz Tê's goal had not been too shabby either. This time, Rooney misplaced a pass on the edge of West Ham's penalty area. Diamé carried the ball forward then played it to the left for Matt Jarvis. Rio Ferdinand was turned far too easily and, when the cross was chipped up to the far post, Carroll had a clear height advantage over Patrice Evra. Vaz Tê had anticipated that Carroll's effort might come his way and applied the decisive touch with a stooping header. Rooney, unwittingly involved in both West Ham goals, looked forlorn when he was substituted and will remember the occasion with little fondness.</p><p>Ferguson's men had flickered only sporadically before an equaliser that was classy in its creation. Van Persie's pass sent Kagawa running through the inside-left channel. Winston Reid dived in too impulsively and Kagawa dropped his shoulder, turned to the byline then played the ball across the goalmouth to precisely where Valencia wanted it. From two yards, Valencia could hardly miss.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danieltaylor\">Daniel Taylor</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The last train to Manchester from Euston is at 9pm and the final train to Wigan from the same station departs at 8.31pm.</p><p>On Wednesday night the FA released a statement declaring that 5.15pm is \"a regular kick-off time in the football calendar\" and insisted that the majority of fans would use official coaches, run by the competition sponsor National Express, to attend the match. However, supporters say the claim that a small proportion will be travelling by train to London is \"absolute rubbish\" and that the FA's attitude leaves a \"sour taste\".</p><p>Kevin Parker, secretary of the Manchester City Supporters Club, said: \"Not only does it show that they don't care but it shows that they don't know. From where they're coming from in their offices in Soho or their hotels, a 5.15pm kick-off is no problem. But the reality is that a number of fans will be travelling by train and wanted to catch a train home at a sensible time.</p><p>\"What's going to happen now is that people have booked tickets for a 9pm train, the last that City fans can catch, and some of them might not get to see the end of the game – God forbid if it goes to extra time. I don't see any reason at all why this game couldn't have kicked off earlier.</p><p>\"The coaches are going to be in demand because they are all coming from the north west of England. It's unbelievably bad planning. Fans will work round it because that's what they do, but it's not going to be easy, it's going to be financially more difficult. It leaves a sour taste, you always look for the opportunity for the FA to get something right these days and they don't.\"</p><p>Asked if the FA's claim that a small percentage of fans will be travelling by train was correct, Parker added: \"That's absolute rubbish. Most people I know wouldn't dream of driving to London and almost all are catching the train.\"</p><p>Wigan and City met in the Premier League on Wednesday night, hours after the FA released a statement that has compounded an already controversial situation.</p><p>\"The FA would like to highlight that 5.15pm is a regular kick-off time in the football calendar,\" it said. \"This time was agreed with major stakeholders and broadcasters and has been used across the game for a number of years for televised matches. In terms of transportation, a small percentage of Cup final fans use the method of train travel.\"</p><p>Jason Taylor, spokesman for the Wigan Athletic Supporters Club, said: \"The FA don't think about stuff like young children of four or six years old potentially not getting home till 2am if they are travelling by coach. These people aren't going to be getting home till very, very late.</p><p>\"We're in the FA Cup final and we'll do whatever we can do get down there – the FA know that they've got us cornered. There's not many people coming down on the train, because we can't.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa\">The FA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup\">FA Cup</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Aston Villa captain, who was diagnosed with the disease in March last year, has undergone intensive bouts of chemotherapy treatment and is now in remission.</p><p>\"It was a very, very long year but now, after all this treatment, I can go back to a normal life,\" said Petrov, who paid a visit to Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground this week. \"I have finished all of the high intensity treatment and from now on I'll be on the softer treatment, which is two years on tablets. I can start doing things that I couldn't do in the last year. I can take the kids to school, I can come here [to the training ground], I can start doing a bit of work and losing a little bit of weight.\"</p><p>Petrov said that he thought he was suffering from \"just a cold, nothing serious\" before he was diagnosed. \"While the treatment was going on I was surprised how long things were dragging on, it kept dragging and I kept thinking: 'When is this going to finish?' But with a lot of patience and a lot of support from family and friends and everybody I managed to pull through. I had my hard moments but I had good moments as well. I can say I'm lucky because some people with this disease will die very quickly and I managed to keep battling and still be here, still standing. It's really good, that's a great thing.\"</p><p>The 33-year-old paid tribute to the players and staff at Villa and in particular the supporters, who have applauded in the 19th minute of every match, in recognition of Petrov's squad number. \"I don't know how I can thank the fans because it's been incredible,\" the Bulgaria international said. \"Sometimes I have a joke with some friends when they text me saying: 'You've still got that applause in the 19th minute, when are they going to stop?!' But it's been incredible.</p><p>\"I've got a great wife, a strong, great wife and she's been unbelievable, incredible in this journey. The kids as well, my mum and dad, my brother, my wife's mum, they've all been so strong and close beside me. To have support every single day from people who have their own problems and their own life but they keep finding the time to send you a message or call you, it's just unbelievable.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It had been mooted that the Football League would deem a deduction on an already relegated club to be no punishment at all, but it intends to implement the sanction during the current campaign once Portsmouth exit administration, which they expect to do this week.</p><p>\"We feel that although the punishment hasn't technically been activated yet, its effects have certainly been felt from day one of this season,\" said PST's Colin Farmery. \"We feel that we've served the punishment and that it has had an effect on our season, so the points ought to come off now.</p><p>\"We knew that they were going to come off – although we started the season on zero points, mentally everyone started on -10 points. If you are told that you will lose 10 points at some point during the season, you never budget for those points. If you look at it like that then we have been punished.</p><p>\"If we were to end up with a 10-point deduction next season it would feel like we are being punished twice for the same offence. We certainly feel that as a football club we can look in the eyes of a supporter from any other club and say we have been punished for the sins of others considerably over the last three years. We were in the Premier League and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/15/chelsea-portsmouth-fa-cup-final\" title=\"\">FA Cup final</a> – we've suffered three relegations and had 29 points taken off us.\"</p><p>Ashley Brown, the PST chairman, had previously said it would be \"devastating\" if the 10-point sanction was imposed next season, with Portsmouth's future now finally appearing stable despite a second successive relegation.</p><p>Pompey were playing in the Premier League three years ago and won the FA Cup in 2008, but have slid down the divisions due to catastrophic financial mismanagement by a number of owners. However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/10/portsmouth-future-fratton-park-ownership\" title=\"\">following an 11th-hour deal struck at the high court last week regarding the valuation of Fratton Park</a>, PST will&nbsp;become 51% shareholders under a new structure.</p><p>Once they exit administration Portsmouth are expected to appoint a new chief executive and confirm that the caretaker manager, Guy Whittingham, will take up the post on a full-time basis.</p><p>Farmery added: \"The really big challenge is about to begin and that's a really exciting. Everyone's been resigned to League Two football since January and the fact that we knew we were going to lose 10 points as well really put the tin lid on it. As a club we've played at this level in the past and while we feel we should be playing in a higher division because of our status, we're in the division we deserve to be in.</p><p>\"Once we come out of administration we can start functioning as a normal football club again. We've got a number of players on loans or short-term contracts and the ones that our new management team want to keep we should be able to provide the resources for.</p><p>\"We've been a pretty sick club for three or four years now but we've ended this season well and there is confidence that we can take into next year. We have a medium-to-long-term plan to get back into the Championship.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leagueonefootball\">League One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-finances\">Finances</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league\">Football League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cardiff City's long overdue promotion to the Premier League means that Welsh football, for the first time ever, will be home to two top-flight clubs next season, with Malky Mackay's side going toe-to-toe with Swansea City on the biggest stage.</p><p>How we would have laughed at that prospect a little while ago. Cardiff and Swansea have been through everything from winding up orders to administration, and for a snapshot of just how bleak their plight was in the not too distant past, the 1997-98 fourth-tier league table takes some beating. Five places off the bottom, in 88th position on the league ladder, were Swansea, just behind Darlington, Rochdale and Hartlepool. As for Cardiff, they were one rung lower, in 89th place. To give a guide as to the level of interest at that time, when the two clubs met at Ninian Park in 1997 the attendance was 6,459.</p><p>How times have changed. Decrepit old grounds have been replaced with all-seater stadiums that will be sold out almost without fail next season.</p><p>Swansea, who won the League Cup in February and remain on course for a top-10 finish in the Premier League, have already outgrown their new home and this week submitted plans to increase the capacity from 22,500 to 33,000, to cope with the increased demand.</p><p>For Cardiff, however, next season is all about survival rather than expansion. It promises to be quite a challenge, even allowing for the fact that they have been the team to catch in the Championship ever since the end of November and have a wealthy benefactor behind them. Vincent Tan, the club's Malaysian owner, has vowed to spend £25m in the Premier League, which is significantly more than Reading invested after winning the Championship last season but considerably less than Southampton, who secured the other automatic promotion berth, splurged in the summer.</p><p>For a blueprint for success in the Premier League, Tan believes Cardiff need to look no further than Swansea. \"I think it is a model that we should emulate,\" he said in February, when outlining his vision for Cardiff in the top flight. \"We should study more carefully and see how we can follow such a model. We can invest a bit more money than Swansea. They have managed to strategise well, so we would like to strategise well too.</p><p>\"But finally we would like to have some lucky breaks. We would like to buy, for example, someone along the Michu model. We would like to pay £2m and [the player] do very well for us, or pay £5m and do very well for us. But not pay £20m or £30m. We're not going to buy a Fernando Torres for £50m who doesn't score a goal for you. So we have got to be moderate, reasonable and hope for a good break.\"</p><p>Cardiff, in truth, have little in common with Swansea on and off the field.</p><p>In terms of the finances, Cardiff made a £13.6m loss in 2012 and have debts of £83m. Swansea, in contrast, reported a £15.9m profit for the six months up until the end of November 2012 and operate in the black. At Swansea there is supporter representation on the board. At Cardiff the fans have no say in the running of the club and were powerless to stop Tan from changing the kit colour from blue to red last summer.</p><p>When it comes to how things shape up on the pitch, Cardiff have more Premier League experience in their squad than Swansea did when they won promotion in 2011, although age is arguably against many of those players.</p><p>Tommy Smith will be 33 next month, Craig Bellamy turns 34 in July and Heidar Helguson, the club's top scorer with nine league goals, will be 36 in August. Fraizer Campbell, 25, has played in the top flight for three different clubs but he has scored only seven goals in 70 games at that level. Andrew Taylor, the former Middlesbrough left-back, is just about the only Cardiff player who is in his prime and has been a Premier League regular in the past.</p><p>Although Swansea lacked proven Premier League quality in their first season in the top flight, they had a way of playing – monopolising possession combined with a high intensity pressing game – that caused opponents plenty of problems and proved to be a major asset under the management of Brendan Rodgers, who also used the loan market well in that campaign. Cardiff, on the other hand, are much more functional; their success largely built on being solid defensively with a strong work ethic.</p><p>There is, of course, always the potential for unheralded players to blossom at the higher level, in the same way that Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Leon Britton and Joe Allen did for Swansea last season. Within the Cardiff ranks, David Marshall, whom Mackay rates as the best goalkeeper in the Championship, Mark Hudson, the captain, and the South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung, who has showed some nice touches in midfield, feel like the most likely candidates to catch the eye. We will also discover whether Peter Whittingham, who has been one of the most consistent performers in the Championship for several years, can make the step up.</p><p>Elsewhere, though, it feels as if Mackay has plenty of work to do to strengthen Cardiff's squad, despite what Tan said a couple of months ago, when he was asked whether the core of the team was strong enough to survive in the Premier League. \"I think it should be all right,\" he said. \"We also want to give the existing team the opportunity to play in the Premier League.

The owner, Vincent Tan, thought the club would thrive on the field and in the Asian market if they played in red and wore a dragon on their shirt. </em></p><p><em>Some fans were pragmatic enough to accept the changes. They have gone on to enjoy the uptake in the team's form that culminated in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/cardiff-celebrate-promotion-premier-league\">Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League on Tuesday night</a>. Other supporters, such as Scott Thomas, thought the bargain was not worth it. After 30 years of following the club, Thomas walked away from Cardiff City last summer. Here he explains his decision. </em></p><p>\"I don't watch Cardiff City games any more but, when I saw a picture of Craig Bellamy holding a red scarf emblazoned with dragons and the word 'Cardiff' rather than the club's proper name, it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. It confirmed that I made the right decision. I was surprisingly sanguine about the promotion. Cardiff City didn't go up last night; Cardiff City died last summer.</p><p>\"Seeing fans celebrate on the pitch during a news bulletin felt like watching the plug being pulled from a life-support machine that has been keeping an old relative alive. It was just another day at the office for club I no longer recognise. They are just another team now, not the one I supported for decades.</p><p>\"I never dreamed that Cardiff City would make it to the top flight and I wouldn't be there to see it. But the club I supported disappeared when a Malaysian businessman with no previous links to the city and no interest in its football took over Cardiff City and made it literally unrecognisable. The club I followed had history and traditions that went back 100 years, but now its future is subject to the whims of a single man.</p><p>\"I began supporting the club when my uncle and cousin took me to a match against Sheffield Wednesday in the 1975-76 season. I followed them to over 60 grounds in the fourth, third and second tiers with 25 friends I picked up over the years. I'm proud to say only a few of those guys renewed their season tickets for this season and some of them will not be renewing for next year.</p><p>\"It was big decision to walk away. Every fan has their own tipping point, but I knew immediately that I couldn't support a franchise. I wouldn't support a business like Tesco or Sainsbury's, and that's what Cardiff City have become. The club is no longer a community asset; it's just a football team that happens to play in the city. Cardiff City are one step away from MK Dons.</p><p>\"Many supporters stayed and many more will join now – people love a bandwagon – but a lot of the old-timers go less regularly and with less passion. More would have left, but a perfect storm of circumstances whipped fans into a demented reaction. They were desperate for success after so many near-misses and couldn't bear to see Swansea City do so well up the road.</p><p>\"I hate to admit it – old habits die hard – but Swansea City are a model club in many ways. Fan ownership has to be the way forward, but the Football Association aren't going protect the historical identity of clubs. The FA are just a booking agent for Wembley Stadium these days, as shown by the announcement of a 5.15pm kick-off time for this year's Cup final.</p><p>\"Even the national team are inferior to Premier League clubs now. Owners with money – or the promise of money – can do as they please. The FA didn't prevent Newcastle from rebranding their stadium and they didn't save Wimbledon, so they weren't going to save Cardiff City. We have listed buildings in this country, but football clubs are a free for all.</p><p>\"I could never support another club, but I've enjoyed watching other teams and other sports. I went to Wales's game in Scotland at Hampden last month, then to the Six Nations at Murrayfield and then to see Rangers play a few days later. Going to the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as rugby and boxing has been refreshing. On balance, it's better to be away from the venal, soul-destroying situation at Cardiff City.\"</p><p><em>Scott Thomas was speaking to Paul Campbell</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Twelve teams started into the first season on September 8 1888, which would produce Preston North End as their very first champions.</p><p>We've crunched the numbers of all 113 top flight seasons (1888-1892: Football League, 1892-1992: First Division, 1992-today: Premier League). Eleven seasons had been suspended during the first and second world wars.</p><p>Since the foundation of the Football League, a total of 64 teams have played at least one season in the respective top flight of English football. Everton, one of the twelve founding members, is currently playing its 110th season in the top league, having missed only four for two spells in the second division. It is topping the list of most seasons played in the top flight.</p><p>23 teams have been crowned champions at least once, Manchester United (19 titles), Liverpool (18) and Arsenal (13) being the most successful collectors of silverware. </p><p>If we combine the two metrics – championships won and seasons played in the top league – we can calculate an efficiency index in winning tropies when in the race. Which puts Huddersfield Town right in the top group along the above serial winners.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>From a geographical perspective, London might have been and still be the city with by far the most teams, but its the North-Western cities that picked up most of the trophies to date. Our map shows how the 113 championship trophies have been spread across the country.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Over all 113 completed seasons, the average number of goals scored is just above three per game. It has been the highest in the very beginning, at 4.63 in the second season. After being at a steady low for the past fourty years, average goals scored per game have been rising again in the past three seasons. They are now – at a current 2.83 goals per game – on course to finish higher than in any other season since 1967-68.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Finally, if we count every single game played in England's top league since it was founded towards one table, this is what it would look like as of April 14 2013. Points are counted as they were awarded at the time, so two points for a win until 1981, three afterwards (did you know that the initial idea of the founders was to award points for wins only, so that it would make no difference if you drew or lost a game?).</p><p>What can you do with this data?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/davidbauer.ch/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au5EaQXOeZRGdHZDalp4elMyUEgybDhmeGJDOWFwSHc#gid=0\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a><br />• SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.myfootballfacts.com/All-TimeTopFlightPointsTable1888-89to2010-11.html\">Myfootballfacts.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/about/history.html 15:56\">Premier League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/PastWinnersDetail/0,,10794~475363,00.html \">Football League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1888-89.html\">Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation</a></p><h2>NEW!

Under the steady hand of Malky Mackay, the Red Dragons (nee: Bluebirds) secured the point they needed against Charlton Athletic last night, prompting the kind of raucous carousing and celebrating last witnessed in the Welsh capital on the night of Charlotte Church's 21st birthday party.</p><p></p><p>The reaction to the Komodos' success has been mixed, with some supporters of other clubs appearing quite sniffy about the notion that in a romantic age when most successful British football clubs are owned by benevolent local mill owners eager to provide cheap entertainment for grateful workers to enjoy in their downtime, Cardiff have somehow 'cheated' by pumping millions into their club and changing the colour of their shirts in a bid to 'buy' success. The fact of the matter is, however, that like their Cardiff counterparts, most of these fans would happily wear pink replica shirts with a dancing cartoon Malayan tiger above a bowl of Nasi Goreng on the crest if they thought it would increase their club's chances of mixing it with the big boys and winning a trophy.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm very proud of the football club, the people of this club have had a lot of disappointment,\" said Mackay, who may well face disappointment of his own if chairman Vincent Tan decides further rebranding is required around the training ground. \"They have been through some tough times. The people of Cardiff have waited a long time to be back in the top division and they've never been in the Premier League. They've backed me and they've backed this football team and for that I will be forever grateful.\"</p><p></p><p>Among the locals celebrating on the pitch at the final whistle last night was a heavily tattooed young ruffian named Craig Bellamy, who signed permanently for his home-town club last August after leaving Liverpool for personal reasons. \"This is where we're from; we wear our heart on my sleeve,\" said Bellers, rather confusingly, who also famously wears an indelible depiction of the 1402 Battle of Pilleth, won by Owain Glyndwr, on his sleeve. \"I feel so privileged to have done it here, where the people I love most are nearby. I spoke to my father after the game, and he told me that he would now die a happy man.\"</p><p></p><p>With the Premier League fixtures to be announced on Wednesday 19 June, all eyes will now turn to Cardiff's two matches with Welsh rivals Swansea City, mouthwatering fixtures for which both clubs may well rebrand their club crests to incorporate cartoon dust-clouds with assorted fists, boots and 'oof!' noises emerging from them.

I did not go out to attack a horse. I love animals – I've got three dogs, a fish pond out the back and I feed foxes across the road. For some reason people are more upset about the fact that I hit a horse than a policewoman getting hurt. But I would like to apologise to the horse, to all the mounted section, to people of the north-east\" – Newcastle fan and animal-lover Barry Rogerson says sorry for swinging a haymaker at a police horse during the violence that erupted after Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. Rogerson went on to say he was wearing a scarf around his face at the time because it was \"cold\".</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"I note with some curiosity the almost complete lack of reaction to the FA's decision not to punish Sergio Agüero retrospectively for what appeared to be a concerted attempt to emasculate David Luiz from an unusual angle on Sunday. Oliver Holt tweeted at the time that 'there may have been a case for a straight red', presumably he meant with two-footed studs-up lunges at other players' upper thighs being such a disciplinary grey area. When compared to the universal outrage and debates about 'that type of player' that followed Callum McManaman's recent trangression being unpunished, the difference was stark. On the one hand it may be a positive sign that the English sporting press is finally progressing past the xenophobia that among other things has routinely seen foreign players roundly criticised for diving, while Tabloid Wayne and particularly $tevie Mbe's regular tangles with the invisible man go unremarked. On the other, it could just be the usual witless inconsistency of journalism born of populism writ large. Yeah, it's the other, isn't it\" – Jason Tew.</p><p></p><p>\"So … the FA suits continue to slavishly appease their television paymasters by shunting the FA Cup final forward two and a quarter hours to 5.15pm (yesterday's Quote of the Day). While it is no surprise that they show scant disregard for the travelling faithful from England's north-west, what about us poor Poms over here in Australia? The traditional midnight kick-off (Australian time) for this showpiece event was never ideal, but at least 'do-able'. Now the fan who is not in possession of a video recorder is faced with three choices: 1) go to bed super-early on Saturday night and set the alarm to be up super-early on Sunday morning; 2) go to bed super-late on Sunday morning and sleep in till late Sunday afternoon; or 3) sleep at a normal civilised hour and have a 'Likely Lads' day on Sunday, avoiding all contact with the outside world until such time as a televised re-run can be watched ostensibly live. Hang on … I've just thought of a fourth, even better, option: don't bother at all\" – Allastair McGillivray.</p><p></p><p>\"David McKee (yesterday's Fiver letters) cites 'double editions being sent, poor journalism, inaccurate score predictions and lack of humour' as 'recent incompetence' from the Fiver.

As I was in Florida, my experience of that incident was via that combustible mix of absurdity, bleakly cynical wit and outrage that ripples out in the form of Twitter fragments, whether in the aftermath of that crowd trouble in Newcastle, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/14/millwall-fa-wembley-wigan\">Milwall fans fighting among themselves at Wembley</a>, or, closer to home, the FC Dallas player George John being struck by a bottle thrown from <em>his own supporter's section</em>, after scoring an 88th minute winning goal against Los Angeles Galaxy — all incidents that occurred this weekend and that collectively gave the two days a surreally ugly quality. They're moments where disgust at the actual violence involved is mixed with a head-shaking disbelief at apparently grown adults who appear unable to grasp the fundamentally symbolic nature of sport, even when they're just there to watch. </p><p>In the George John case, for better or worse, the action seemed to be an isolated incident rather than a representation of typical behavior from a supporters group, or part of a pattern of crowd disturbances. That said, quite rightly the incident is being taken seriously by the club and MLS, and <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\">with reports of an attack on a Portland Timbers fan by San Jose supporters</a> this weekend, MLS reputation as a generally family friendly league is under scrutiny.</p><p><em></em></p><p>To take the John incident first, the player headed in the goal then appeared to many in the crowd to collide with the post and lie on the ground clutching the back of his head. The Dallas bench were initially unclear what had happened, and even the player didn't know what had struck him at first. When I spoke to the NBC team who were covering the game, Kyle Martino, who covers the games from between the team benches, confirmed that it was only when he started getting feedback over his headphones from the outside broadcast truck, about the replays showing the hurled bottle, that Dallas FC staff were alerted and began looking for the perpetrator. John, who'd come into the game as a doubt after receiving a concussion a week earlier, completed the game and actually joked with the broadcast team in interviews afterwards that next time the fans should drink the beer and not throw it, before leaving the scene for treatment on a nasty gash. </p><p>At time of writing neither MLS or FC Dallas owners had reached a decision on further action, though the two were in dialogue on Tuesday and an announcement was expected by Wednesday to indicate what action would follow from the club owners in the wake of the incident. In the meantime the club issued this short statement:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It is always unacceptable to throw anything onto the field of play because it endangers the safety of all players and personnel. In this specific incident, we have identified the individual and we are proceeding according to protocol with FC Dallas Stadium security, Frisco Police and Major League Soccer.</p></blockquote><p>To be clear, all of the Dallas Supporters group reps I spoke to, including our regular Guardian commenter Gina Zippilli, were genuinely mortified by the incident. The section of the ground the bottle was thrown from is a supporter group section, though admission to the section is not controlled by the supporter groups, and the particular individual involved is not believed to have been affiliated to any supporter group. Zippilli described a process of going through their member list and comparing photographs to NBC footage to try and identify the perpetrator, and talked about the \"idiot who turned a win into what felt like a loss, for how it would reflect on us.\" Zippilli is a member of the Inferno supporters group, some of whom were seated in the area, along with members of the Dallas Beer Guardians (a pun on the over-21 Beer Garden section of the stadium where the bottle was thrown from). </p><p>There have been sporadic similar incidents in the past in MLS: Sporting KC goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZjQhjmEP3c\">Jimmy Nielsen was struck by a bobblehead doll</a> during a game against Portland Timbers in 2011, and Houston Dynamo fans were punished by MLS for throwing objects during the MLS cup final in the same year. Each incident brings up questions about MLS supporter culture — which at its best melds elements of the constant singing of South American fans, the wit and chants of British fans, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jun/28/portland-timbers-seattle-sounders-tifo-display\">the conspicuous displays of the<em> tifosi</em></a> in an entertaining American hybrid. Lurking behind all of this appropriation and reinvention of course (and an ever present balancing act for MLS, clubs and even the formal supporter groups themselves) is the fear that certain fans might appropriate or imitate other less desirable cultural forms such as hooliganism, as misplaced marks of an authentic supporter culture. </p><p>For this reason, potentially as disturbing as the John incident, and perhaps more so (given the collective nature of it), were<a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\"> the reports that a Portland fan was set upon by a group of San Jose fans the next evening</a>. If true, that represents a rather more worrying development — sections of the San Jose support enjoy a somewhat mixed reputation among their peers as it is, and there have been previous incidents with rival LA groups when the two have met, but any suggestion that that behavior was bleeding into city centers at any scale will do little for the reputation of the league. </p><p>Somewhat encouragingly, the organized San Jose supporter groups such as the 1906 Ultras have been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1906Ultras?fref=ts\">quick to distance themselves from the perpetrators</a> and have suggested that if it transpires that any of their members were implicated, they will be expelled and the victims compensated. But in a week where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/16/nbc-premier-league-match-of-the-day\">NBC announced blanket coverage of the Premier League</a>, and in the wake of ESPN's expanded English language coverage of the Mexican league, it was disheartening to see any part of MLS participate in any form in the darker side of the culture of the sport, as it continues its slow, but seemingly inexorable globalizing push into the wider US consciousness.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls\">MLS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">US sports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fcdallas\">FC Dallas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/san-jose-earthquakes\">San Jose Earthquakes</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graham-parker\">Graham Parker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Although many clubs promote a telephone hotline, it is hoped that the app will allow fans to report racist, homophobic or antisemitic abuse as it occurs.</p><p>Like almost everything else Kick It Out does, the project has been developed on a shoestring, by calling in favours and relying on goodwill. As the Premier League debates how to divide its £5.5bn broadcasting windfall, there are fears that unless Kick It Out's budget is significantly increased it will be impossible for it to perform the wider, more proactive role demanded of it by those players who protested last October.</p><p>With a permanent staff of six who inhabit a small office four floors above a Pizza Express in London, Kick It Out receives £125,000 a year from the Football Association, the Premier League and the Professional Footballers' Association – all of which laud its work over the past two decades. Funding discussions are ongoing but the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, conceded it would find it hard to fulfil its remit on its current income. \"The level of funding they have at the moment makes it almost inevitable that black players operating at the cutting edge of this feel that it is not enough,\" he told the Guardian.</p><p>Those protests from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/25/jason-roberts-protest-kick-it-out\" title=\"\">Reading's Jason Roberts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/20/rio-ferdinand-kick-it-out-shirt\" title=\"\">Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand</a>, his brother Anton (then at Queens Park Rangers), Manchester City's Micah Richards and others were fuelled by anger over the Luis Suárez and John Terry affairs, the perceived inaction of the FA, Uefa and Fifa, and frustration that they were not being listened to by governing bodies or their union. The annual \"weeks of action\" held by Kick It Out, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and runs a range of programmes across football, provided a convenient platform for dissent.</p><p>\"I didn't agree with the T-shirt protests at the time,\" says Clarke Carlisle, the Northampton Town defender and PFA chairman. \"I wore mine because I thought Kick It Out was the wrong target. I told those players who weren't going to wear their T-shirts that I thought it should be aimed at the FA, at Uefa, at Fifa – the people who actually make the decisions.</p><p>\"But what came back to me was that players felt they didn't have the outlet to make their point and this was their opportunity. So when the explanation did come, people like myself had to acknowledge they'd made a very good point. It brought a lot of attention to what was happening and almost forced the hands of the PFA, the FA, of Kick It Out and subsequently the government to take a real forensic look at how they were addressing the issue.\"</p><p>Garth Crooks, the former Tottenham Hotspur striker turned broadcaster and campaigner, believes the protests were a \"seminal moment\" and a long overdue cry of frustration. He wants to see more players speak out. \"If you're a professional footballer, black or white, and you want to see the sport change for the better as far as race is concerned then put up or shut up,\" he says. \"Black players have a great opportunity to change the game today. And their silence is not helping the process, it's inhibiting it. If you say nothing, you make things worse. Stand up, speak up or shut up.\"</p><p>Clarke says the PFA's structure has been reshaped to enable it to respond better to the concerns of current players. \"It will make us more dynamic and allow us to react far more incisively to an issue that has evolved,\" he says. \"The issue of racism has evolved dramatically since the 1970s. We're not tackling the same facets that we were back then.\"</p><p>Kick It Out is developing a new players' panel and Andy Cole and Jason Euell have expressed an interest in being involved.</p><p>Chief among the concerns of those who protested was the feeling that a \"generation gap\" had emerged between the players who fought the brutal prejudice of the 1970s and 1980s and those today facing new battles for recognition as managers, coaches and administrators at all levels of the game.</p><p>\"The big problem we've got is dressing-room culture,\" says Kick It Out's chairman, Lord Ouseley. \"People put up with a lot and you'd never know. No one actually challenges that culture.</p><p>\"I think we've still got a problem with the way overall authorities run football. They pay lip service to the fact they support Kick It Out and other initiatives. That is great and we're able to make a limited contribution. But it's not enough. We have to get personal leadership at club level. One of the biggest problems in all of this is that the clubs take no responsibility. They defend the indefensible,\" he adds, still stung by Liverpool's behaviour during the Suárez affair, by Chelsea's backing for Terry, by the intervention of Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"We needed to clear the decks. The FA needed to make clear what happened, why it happened and set the tone to move forward. To this day, we haven't purged ourselves of the errors of that.\"</p><p>He was speaking on the sidelines of Kick It Out's Raise Your Game conference, where 200 young people were being matched with mentors from throughout the game. It is the sort of thing that the organisation wants to do more of but it is also pulled together on an impossibly tight budget. Nor can it fund research into just how wide the problem is or expand meaningfully into the Football League or Conference. Then there are other forms of discrimination – sexism, homophobia, antisemitism – to consider. \"The organisation is working with the same resources and yet it has all these new facets to its work,\" says Carlisle. \"It needs the funds, it needs the person power to go out and do all these things.\"</p><p>In the past six months the issue has barely been out of the news, from the depressing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/29/world-cup-2014-qualifiers-englandfootballteam\" title=\"\">\"bonfire song\" affair</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/29/robbie-rogers-coming-out-gay\" title=\"\">to the decision of the USA international Robbie Rogers to quit the game rather than remain in it as a gay man</a>. There are signs of progress amid the gloom and Ouseley says it also right to remember how far football has come.</p><p>In the wake of a government summit, the FA has produced a typically verbose 92-point plan, including a commitment to a 10% minimum quota for coaches and referees from ethnic minorities and a vow to use St George's Park as a catalyst for change, which has been given a cautious welcome by most.</p><p>But Ouseley – who quit the FA council in frustration at the glacial pace of change – remains profoundly concerned that until English football's dysfunctional governance structure is reformed, and the cultures within clubs, the FA and the Premier League transformed from the top down, real progress will remain slow. \"Right now, we're in a bit of a state of limbo,\" he says. \"The FA produced a 92-point plan, which could have been reduced to about six main points and should have been implemented already.

Although many clubs promote a telephone hotline, it is hoped that the app will allow fans to report racist, homophobic or antisemitic abuse as it occurs.</p><p>Like almost everything else Kick It Out does, the project has been developed on a shoestring, by calling in favours and relying on goodwill. As the Premier League debates how to divide its £5.5bn broadcasting windfall, there are fears that unless Kick It Out's budget is significantly increased it will be impossible for it to perform the wider, more proactive role demanded of it by those players who protested last October.</p><p>With a permanent staff of six who inhabit a small office four floors above a Pizza Express in London, Kick It Out receives £125,000 a year from the Football Association, the Premier League and the Professional Footballers' Association – all of which laud its work over the past two decades. Funding discussions are ongoing but the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, conceded it would find it hard to fulfil its remit on its current income. \"The level of funding they have at the moment makes it almost inevitable that black players operating at the cutting edge of this feel that it is not enough,\" he told the Guardian.</p><p>Those protests from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/25/jason-roberts-protest-kick-it-out\" title=\"\">Reading's Jason Roberts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/20/rio-ferdinand-kick-it-out-shirt\" title=\"\">Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand</a>, his brother Anton (then at Queens Park Rangers), Manchester City's Micah Richards and others were fuelled by anger over the Luis Suárez and John Terry affairs, the perceived inaction of the FA, Uefa and Fifa, and frustration that they were not being listened to by governing bodies or their union. The annual \"weeks of action\" held by Kick It Out, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and runs a range of programmes across football, provided a convenient platform for dissent.</p><p>\"I didn't agree with the T-shirt protests at the time,\" says Clarke Carlisle, the Northampton Town defender and PFA chairman. \"I wore mine because I thought Kick It Out was the wrong target. I told those players who weren't going to wear their T-shirts that I thought it should be aimed at the FA, at Uefa, at Fifa – the people who actually make the decisions.</p><p>\"But what came back to me was that players felt they didn't have the outlet to make their point and this was their opportunity. So when the explanation did come, people like myself had to acknowledge they'd made a very good point. It brought a lot of attention to what was happening and almost forced the hands of the PFA, the FA, of Kick It Out and subsequently the government to take a real forensic look at how they were addressing the issue.\"</p><p>Garth Crooks, the former Tottenham Hotspur striker turned broadcaster and campaigner, believes the protests were a \"seminal moment\" and a long overdue cry of frustration. He wants to see more players speak out. \"If you're a professional footballer, black or white, and you want to see the sport change for the better as far as race is concerned then put up or shut up,\" he says. \"Black players have a great opportunity to change the game today. And their silence is not helping the process, it's inhibiting it. If you say nothing, you make things worse. Stand up, speak up or shut up.\"</p><p>Clarke says the PFA's structure has been reshaped to enable it to respond better to the concerns of current players. \"It will make us more dynamic and allow us to react far more incisively to an issue that has evolved,\" he says. \"The issue of racism has evolved dramatically since the 1970s. We're not tackling the same facets that we were back then.\"</p><p>Kick It Out is developing a new players' panel and Andy Cole and Jason Euell have expressed an interest in being involved.</p><p>Chief among the concerns of those who protested was the feeling that a \"generation gap\" had emerged between the players who fought the brutal prejudice of the 1970s and 1980s and those today facing new battles for recognition as managers, coaches and administrators at all levels of the game.</p><p>\"The big problem we've got is dressing-room culture,\" says Kick It Out's chairman, Lord Ouseley. \"People put up with a lot and you'd never know. No one actually challenges that culture.</p><p>\"I think we've still got a problem with the way overall authorities run football. They pay lip service to the fact they support Kick It Out and other initiatives. That is great and we're able to make a limited contribution. But it's not enough. We have to get personal leadership at club level. One of the biggest problems in all of this is that the clubs take no responsibility. They defend the indefensible,\" he adds, still stung by Liverpool's behaviour during the Suárez affair, by Chelsea's backing for Terry, by the intervention of Roy Hodgson.</p><p>\"We needed to clear the decks. The FA needed to make clear what happened, why it happened and set the tone to move forward. To this day, we haven't purged ourselves of the errors of that.\"</p><p>He was speaking on the sidelines of Kick It Out's Raise Your Game conference, where 200 young people were being matched with mentors from throughout the game. It is the sort of thing that the organisation wants to do more of but it is also pulled together on an impossibly tight budget. Nor can it fund research into just how wide the problem is or expand meaningfully into the Football League or Conference. Then there are other forms of discrimination – sexism, homophobia, antisemitism – to consider. \"The organisation is working with the same resources and yet it has all these new facets to its work,\" says Carlisle. \"It needs the funds, it needs the person power to go out and do all these things.\"</p><p>In the past six months the issue has barely been out of the news, from the depressing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/29/world-cup-2014-qualifiers-englandfootballteam\" title=\"\">\"bonfire song\" affair</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/29/robbie-rogers-coming-out-gay\" title=\"\">to the decision of the USA international Robbie Rogers to quit the game rather than remain in it as a gay man</a>. There are signs of progress amid the gloom and Ouseley says it also right to remember how far football has come.</p><p>In the wake of a government summit, the FA has produced a typically verbose 92-point plan, including a commitment to a 10% minimum quota for coaches and referees from ethnic minorities and a vow to use St George's Park as a catalyst for change, which has been given a cautious welcome by most.</p><p>But Ouseley – who quit the FA council in frustration at the glacial pace of change – remains profoundly concerned that until English football's dysfunctional governance structure is reformed, and the cultures within clubs, the FA and the Premier League transformed from the top down, real progress will remain slow. \"Right now, we're in a bit of a state of limbo,\" he says. \"The FA produced a 92-point plan, which could have been reduced to about six main points and should have been implemented already. What we need is a clear idea of how to move on.</p><p>\"If those groups of players feel there is insufficient progress in visibly seeing more black people in prominent positions as coaches and managers, and other opportunities in football, those grievances might well surface again.\"The approach of the incoming FA chairman, Greg Dyke, who famously called the BBC \"hideously white\" as part of a proactive attempt to change the culture there, will be key.</p><p>Robertson, while welcoming the progress made since the catalyst of the T-shirt protests, agrees: \"This is also an issue tied up with the wider governance of the game in general. You maybe wouldn't need more funding for Kick It Out if there were more black faces on the Council, on the board and involved in the running of the game.\"</p><p>Yet while progress on wider reform remains frustratingly, teeth-grindingly slow, in the here and now it seems incongruous that amid wide support for the job done by Kick It Out and clear agreement that discrimination in all its guises - on the pitch, in the stands and at grassroots level - remains a major issue, that a sport about to bank £5.5bn in TV cash over the next three years cannot afford to properly fund efforts to fight it.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/kick-it-out\">Kick It Out</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race\">Race issues</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez\">Luis Suárez</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/john-terry\">John Terry</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Unfortunately you can't please all the people all the time and, as usual, the announcement has been greeted by predictable chuntering about those who have not made the cut.</p><p>It is, for instance, hard to see what more Michu might have achieved in his debut season in the Premier League. Signed for a mere £2m from Rayo Vallecano, the Spanish forward has been a revelation for Swansea City, scoring 21 goals in all competitions and helping Michael Laudrup's side win the Capital One Cup, which was their first major trophy.</p><p>Combining effortless cool with ruthless precision in front of goal, Michu started with two goals against QPR on his debut, opened the scoring in the 2-0 win at Chelsea in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final and produced a brilliant toe-poked finish in the 5-0 win over Bradford City in the final. He was also Swansea's match-winner when they won 2-0 at Arsenal in November, keeping his cool to score twice in the closing minutes, and also earned the Welsh side a point against Manchester United in December. He has scored every type of goal – headers, tap-ins, one-on-ones, long-rangers – and has been a creative force, too. His absence is difficult to justify.</p><p>Everton fans are probably wondering whether a clerical error has led to the omission of Leighton Baines, whose link-up play with Steven Pienaar on the left flank has been as good as ever, although Marouane Fellaini has perhaps failed to hit the heights he reached when United were beaten 1-0 at Goodison Park on the opening day of the season. The preposterous 35-yard free-kick that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX6_JZ7-is\" title=\"\">Baines scored against Newcastle</a> in January was one of the moments of the season and his seven goals have maintained Everton's push for a place in the top four.</p><p>Of all the names on the list, Eden Hazard's is perhaps the most surprising. That is not to say that he has not enjoyed an impressive season for Chelsea but like Arsenal's Santi Cazorla, he suffered a dip in form after a strong start. Hazard's team-mate Juan Mata has been far more consistent, although that is to be expected from a player who is two years older and flourishing in his second season in England. The Spaniard has 18 goals and has made 32 assists in all competitions.</p><p>Despite those awesome figures, Mata is unlikely to win the award. The bookie's favourite is Bale, whose jaw-dropping performances mean that all of Europe's top clubs are likely to be entering into a battle of wills with Tottenham's chairman, Daniel Levy, this summer. Bale has been as close as it gets to a one-man team, even if such a tag does a disservice to his team-mates, and there have been times when it has felt like he has won games on his own for Spurs.</p><p>He is not quite in the same league as either player, but Bale has hit free-kicks like Cristiano Ronaldo and scored solo goals that have been reminiscent of Lionel Messi. The stabbed shot against Swansea at the end of March, struck before Michel Vorm had even had time to think and past the goalkeeper in a flash, could have been included in a Messi showreel.</p><p>It could be argued, though, that Bale packed his finest work into a two-month period and similar accusations will be thrown at Robin van Persie, who has been sluggish since the middle of January. The Dutchman recently went 10 games without a goal for Manchester United and missed crucial chances during the defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League. But by then his work in the league had been done. Without his 21 goals, such as the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyNSBnOerrQ\" title=\"\"> last-minute winner in the Manchester derby in December</a>, United would not be 13 points clear of Manchester City.</p><p>He has benefited, too, from the way that Michael Carrick has pulled the strings in midfield. Having been the object of much scorn for so long, largely because he has been unable to compete with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta in two Champions League finals, people are finally starting to appreciate Carrick's true worth. He remains an 80-1 longshot though, and will not win.</p><p>Brendan Rodgers has repeatedly been making the case for Luis Suárez and if the award is based on consistency rather than trophies, it should go to the Liverpool striker. Unlike Van Persie and Bale he has been imperious throughout, and has scored hat-tricks against Norwich and Wigan. The Uruguayan is not a flat-track bully, though. Despite playing in an inferior team, there have been goals against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, Everton, United and Tottenham.

Unfortunately you can't please all the people all the time and, as usual, the announcement has been greeted by predictable chuntering about those who have not made the cut.</p><p>It is, for instance, hard to see what more Michu might have achieved in his debut season in the Premier League. Signed for a mere £2m from Rayo Vallecano, the Spanish forward has been a revelation for Swansea City, scoring 21 goals in all competitions and helping Michael Laudrup's side win the Capital One Cup, which was their first major trophy.</p><p>Combining effortless cool with ruthless precision in front of goal, Michu started with two goals against QPR on his debut, opened the scoring in the 2-0 win at Chelsea in the first leg of their League Cup semi-final and produced a brilliant toe-poked finish in the 5-0 win over Bradford City in the final. He was also Swansea's match-winner when they won 2-0 at Arsenal in November, keeping his cool to score twice in the closing minutes, and also earned the Welsh side a point against Manchester United in December. He has scored every type of goal – headers, tap-ins, one-on-ones, long-rangers – and has been a creative force, too. His absence is difficult to justify.</p><p>Everton fans are probably wondering whether a clerical error has led to the omission of Leighton Baines, whose link-up play with Steven Pienaar on the left flank has been as good as ever, although Marouane Fellaini has perhaps failed to hit the heights he reached when United were beaten 1-0 at Goodison Park on the opening day of the season. The preposterous 35-yard free-kick that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX6_JZ7-is\" title=\"\">Baines scored against Newcastle</a> in January was one of the moments of the season and his seven goals have maintained Everton's push for a place in the top four.</p><p>Of all the names on the list, Eden Hazard's is perhaps the most surprising. That is not to say that he has not enjoyed an impressive season for Chelsea but like Arsenal's Santi Cazorla, he suffered a dip in form after a strong start. Hazard's team-mate Juan Mata has been far more consistent, although that is to be expected from a player who is two years older and flourishing in his second season in England. The Spaniard has 18 goals and has made 32 assists in all competitions.</p><p>Despite those awesome figures, Mata is unlikely to win the award. The bookie's favourite is Bale, whose jaw-dropping performances mean that all of Europe's top clubs are likely to be entering into a battle of wills with Tottenham's chairman, Daniel Levy, this summer. Bale has been as close as it gets to a one-man team, even if such a tag does a disservice to his team-mates, and there have been times when it has felt like he has won games on his own for Spurs.</p><p>He is not quite in the same league as either player, but Bale has hit free-kicks like Cristiano Ronaldo and scored solo goals that have been reminiscent of Lionel Messi. The stabbed shot against Swansea at the end of March, struck before Michel Vorm had even had time to think and past the goalkeeper in a flash, could have been included in a Messi showreel.</p><p>It could be argued, though, that Bale packed his finest work into a two-month period and similar accusations will be thrown at Robin van Persie, who has been sluggish since the middle of January. The Dutchman recently went 10 games without a goal for Manchester United and missed crucial chances during the defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League. But by then his work in the league had been done. Without his 21 goals, such as the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyNSBnOerrQ\" title=\"\"> last-minute winner in the Manchester derby in December</a>, United would not be 13 points clear of Manchester City.</p><p>He has benefited, too, from the way that Michael Carrick has pulled the strings in midfield. Having been the object of much scorn for so long, largely because he has been unable to compete with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta in two Champions League finals, people are finally starting to appreciate Carrick's true worth. He remains an 80-1 longshot though, and will not win.</p><p>Brendan Rodgers has repeatedly been making the case for Luis Suárez and if the award is based on consistency rather than trophies, it should go to the Liverpool striker. Unlike Van Persie and Bale he has been imperious throughout, and has scored hat-tricks against Norwich and Wigan. The Uruguayan is not a flat-track bully, though. Despite playing in an inferior team, there have been goals against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, Everton, United and Tottenham. Liverpool might only be seventh, but who knows where they might have been without Suárez who has Stewart Downing for company instead of, say, Mata.</p><p>Bale and Hazard are also on the shortlist for the Young Player of the Year – whether they should feature on both is debatable – and the former is being tipped to win both awards. Christian Benteke would be a better choice. His goals could keep Aston Villa up and there are bigger clubs who are kicking themselves for not spotting him last summer. Romelu Lukaku has also made a strong impression during his loan spell at West Bromwich.</p><p>However there are surely more deserving candidates than Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck. The former has not truly caught the imagination, while the latter has only scored twice despite playing up front for the champions-elect. If you could combine Welbeck and Javier Hernández, you would have the perfect forward but that remains a problem for a mad scientist to solve. Southampton's Luke Shaw, Manchester City's Matija Nastasic and Wigan's James McCarthy can all feel aggrieved not to have been shortlisted.</p><p>It's just a bit of fun though, nothing to get too worked up over.

As you'll see below, our regular Revs commenter Julie Kumor, was touched by the league-wide support for a club that was still processing the news of Kevin Alston's leukemia when Monday's tragedy happened. Players Matt Reis and Chris Tierney had loved-ones injured in the blast, and while sport is indeed a pretty trivial distraction at a time like this, the <strong>Revs</strong> will perhaps be glad of any such distraction as they visit <strong>New York</strong> on Saturday and try to get back to some sense of normality.</p><p>Before that game takes place <strong>Toronto</strong> will start the day off welcoming a <strong>Houston</strong> team who now stand alone in holding the longest unbeaten home record in the league. Though they're not at home this week, they're in Toronto — where the hosts have discovered the joys of scoring rather than conceding late, hauling back a 2-0 deficit in the last five minutes in their last home game against Supporters Shield leaders Dallas. <strong>Dallas</strong> will be back in action on Saturday against <strong>Vancouver</strong>, in their first of two successive games against the 'Caps. We may know more about both sides' long term credentials after that series, though we may also know a little more than we'd wished to about seating arrangements at the home stadium, as the club concludes their investigation into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/17/george-john-fc-dallas-bottle-head\">the incident that saw George John hit by a beer bottle last weekend</a>.</p><p><strong>Seattle</strong> would settle for the rather more prosaic activity of hitting the net - yet to win, the Sounders take their travails to <strong>Colorado</strong>, who checked the Chivas express last week and who have inched their stretched squad to within goal difference of the early playoff frontrunners. The Sounders aren't the only team who've been struggling for goals, though <strong>Chicago</strong> have rather broken their drought by scoring four in their last two. Not enough to get anything from their last game though, and they host a <strong>Crew</strong> side solidly tucked in behind the frontrunners, and who held the Impact to a 1-1 scoreline last week.</p><p><strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> continue to labor a little, though a point in Vancouver last time out was a decent result. They host a <strong>Chivas</strong> side who failed to really show up in their home loss to Colorado last week. For a Salt Lake team still in that dread phase of \"transition\", a similarly subdued perfromance from the goats would be very welcome. Don't count on it though. Meanwhile the <strong>Galaxy</strong> will try to get their disappointing result against Dallas out of the way when they host a <strong>Sporting KC</strong> side who are steadily easing into their stride. One thing the Galaxy have in their favor is that Sporting played in New York on Wednesday night, though the encouragement of a win that took them to the familiar summit of the Eastern standings may give the visitors some momentum on the long journey across the country to the Home Depot Center.</p><p>Two games on Sunday. An officially struggling<strong> DC</strong> take on a <strong>Philadelphia</strong> team unbeaten since a lackluster trip to New York last month, and coming off a rest week, though in the interests of balance it should be noted they haven't actually won a game since squeezing past New England 1-0 on March 16th. That game could be tight whatever way it goes. Finally, <strong>Portland</strong> travel to <strong>San Jose</strong> on Sunday night for what could be a fractious affair, after former Timber Alan Gordon landed <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/04/16/san-jose-earthquakes-forward-alan-gordon-gets-three-game-suspension-homophob\">a three match ban for homophobic comments</a> made during last week's game. Portland got the better of last week's game all round, after Will Johnson curled in a great free kick to win it, but back at San Jose, and with players coming back from injury, the Earthquakes may believe that Gordon or no Gordon, they can reverse the result. </p><p>As always, we've asked our usual cast of fan reps and writers to give us their take on the big stories at their clubs this week. See what they have to say below then give us your take on the week's events and what you think will happen this weekend. And we'll be back on Monday with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned\">Five things we learned</a>.</p><p>All game times ET</p><h2>Toronto FC vs Houston Dynamo </h2><p>Sat 4:00PM, BMO Field (TSN)</p><p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>:</p><p>Toronto FC is not its own worst enemy. It's not the backline that kills the team, nor inconsistency of unmarked opposing players or the killer stoppage-time-equalizing-goal. No, Toronto's biggest enemy is the city's train system.<br />You see, trains depart from the stadium almost on the hour; therefore the train's schedule does not coincide with the length of a soccer game. In other words, if a game at BMO Field starts on the hour, those who take the GO Train either leave early or having to wait another full 60 minutes for the next train. And in bad weather, after a bad game, that can be a long 60 minutes.</p><p>However, the fans that chose comfort over the final whistle are doing themselves a disservice, as the most exciting part of a Toronto FC game is the last ten minutes. And this season, sometimes those exciting moments actually come from TFC.</p><p>In their last home again against FC Dallas, Toronto came back to draw 2–2 in the final minutes. Not only were there goals, but also bad calls, missed handballs, and general hullabaloo from the crowd. The last ten minutes of the game had more energy, emotion, and singing than the previous 80 combined. Of course, the complete opposite happened in their next game against Philadelphia Union. The lesson? On Saturday, stay for the whole match when they face Houston at BMO Field; Toronto FC will make it worth your while (disclaimer: no guarantee it will be in a positive way). </p><p><strong>Stephen Eastepp</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p><p>The Houston Dynamo secured a spot in the MLS history books with a big win over the Chicago Fire last weekend. With the win, they are now unbeaten in 35 straight home matches which is a pretty impressive feat. While there hasn't been incredible hype around the feat in Houston, the fans certainly were all over it and it really was a special moment for all of them.</p><p>Now the Dynamo turn their attention to the enemy – a road game. It really doesn't matter the opponent at this point, Houston just can't seem to figure out their problems away from BBVA Compass Stadium. This time, they'll travel to BMO Field to face Toronto FC who are hungry for a win after three straight draws.</p><p>Last time the Dynamo visited Toronto, they walked off the pitch with a 2-0 shutout win and their first ever victory at BMO Field. Hopefully some of that luck will carry over to Saturday's match. We're likely to see the same starting lineup that was fielded against Chicago, with Boniek Garcia still nursing an injury. I've been told Garcia will make the trip, but may be limited on playing time. Will Bruin and Giles Barnes are beginning to gel up front and I wouldn't be surprised to see both of them get on the scoreboard Saturday. The Dynamo defense will have their hands full with Robert Earnshaw and pulling of a win won't be easy. </p><h2>Colorado Rapids vs Seattle Sounders</h2><p>Sat 6:00PM, Dick's Sporting Goods Park</p><p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, <a href=\"http://c38sg.com\">Centennial 38 Supporters</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p><p>The Sounders are coming to town this weekend for a game that's already being dubbed the Cannabis Cup, as the two sides are in states where legalization has happened, and evidence that someone at MLS scheduling might have a sense of humor the game is being played on 4/20. </p><p>Even more bizarrely, the Rapids are on a streak - unbeaten in three and winning the last two, the second choice #rapkids are getting the job done. So much so that captain Drew Moor came back from suspension only as far as the bench last week, and with the way that rookie goalkeeper Clint Irwin is playing there's no guarantee Matt Pickens will come straight back into the team when he eventually returns from injury. Irwin has faced an MLS record 4 penalties in his first four games - going the right way on all of them and saving two (and four points with them). The Sounders have been having trouble scoring and against all the odds with all the injuries, the Rapids aren't conceding. We're even seeing light at the end of the tunnel with the injuries. Anthony Wallace is back after two years out, and Mastroeni and Rivero are back in full training.</p><p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.sounderatheart.com/\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p><p>Sounders FC has problems right now. The easy way to look at it is that they have yet to win an MLS game. Slightly deeper is to notice that they are not scoring goals, but the defense is still decent (Best XI Defensive Mids will do that). Taking it even deeper still is that they are getting shots at a mere average rate. Lastly, maybe the most worrisome stat is that is that Sigi Schmid has tried nine different players at forward.</p><p>There is some good news. The two of those forwards that are supposed to be the best — if salary equals talent — are both practicing again. A team that has trouble scoring goals that gets to reinsert Obafemi Martins and Eddie Johnson should get better at finding chances and converting chances to elusive goals.</p><p>Because that's what Seattle needs right now, probably even more than a win. A couple of goals would start to resurrect the meaning to a season that is teetering. The brink of a nothing year is right there. To pull away from that edge the club will need to take on a Colorado Rapids side that is also struggling and prone to weaknesses in the same areas where Seattle is strong. Three points would be best, but at this point a couple of goals may mean more.</p><h2>New York Red Bulls vs New England Revolution</h2><p>Sat 7:00PM, Red Bull Arena</p><p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p><p>The Red Bulls wrap up a three-game week on Saturday at home against the New England Revolution. New York will be feeling the after effects of a shutout loss against Kansas City on Wednesday, but there's really no shame in that given Sporting KC's performance as of late. The real issue is that head coach Mike Petke will again have to reshuffle the deck. Inconsistency is the only consistency with the Metros right now, through no fault of Petke's own. Defender and shock Golden Boot candidate Jamison Olave left Wednesday's game early with a hamstring issue. Juninho joined Olave in the locker room before full time after deciding that the one thing missing from Jimmy Nielsen's face was a driven soccer ball. Tack on Thierry Henry's arthritic knees and the short turnaround, and it may come down to picking eleven names from a hat and hoping for the best. If there is a time for a 'get healthy' game, it could be against the Revs, who come into Harrison having scored just one goal through five games. </p><p>As for New England, it's been a hard week. Please support Boston as best you can. If that includes financially, I recommend <a href=\"http://OneFundBoston.org\">OneFundBoston.org</a> or <a href=\"http://BosFireCU.com\">BosFireCU.com</a></p><p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p><p>Last week was a rough week for the entire New England Revolution family. With the news that Kevin Alston was diagnosed with Leukemia, I felt the warm embrace of the MLS community. I was overwhelmed with how other teams and players responded to the news, and hoped Kevin would get well. Saturday I went back to rooting for those guys on the field in Seattle. </p><p>Then Monday happened. As the news spread through my Boston friends, we were in shock. Again I heard from my fellow soccer fans from all over the country, and for the second time in two weeks, I felt the love and respect from my fellow fans, there was that embrace again. I reminded my friends back home that I was safe in Cambridge, this big old university doesn't get the day off, so I was a river away from the finish line. I was okay. </p><p>As the day played out, I heard stories of the injured and friends that had just been in the area moments before, it didn't seem real. Then it was. When the Revs confirmed that Matt Reis' father in law was among the critically injured, suddenly I wasn't okay. My soccer family was hurt directly by this tragedy. </p><p>I have spent more of the 2013 season rooting for my boys off the field, and hope the healing starts on Saturday when 200 us travel to Red Bull Arena. We can finally cheer for our boys on the field away from home, show our soccer family we are strong.</p><h2>FC Dallas vs Vancouver Whitecaps</h2><p>Sat 8:30PM, FC Dallas Stadium</p><p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p><p>The main story all week would have to be \"Beergate\". I really wish it was beating LA but it's not. Obviously <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/17/george-john-fc-dallas-bottle-head\">I spoke to the Guardian earlier this week</a> about how embarrassing it is for us as fans that this happened — the one silver lining being that it turned out that the culprit was not a member of any of the supporters' groups. He can count himself lucky George John didn't press charges and all he got was a charge of public intoxication, but as of right now the club hasn't confirmed what they're going to do in response other than getting rid of aluminum bottles (which the supporters group leaders themselves said were a bad idea at the start of the season).</p><p>To try and move on to the soccer, it was a hard fought, tense win against LA, but a really important one in proving we're genuine challengers. Now we go into the first part of a home and away sequence against Vancouver, and I'm hoping we ride some momentum from the LA game, because the Canadian sides have really improved this season. Toronto gave us a hard time at BMO Field and Vancouver look solid again. But I think we'll keep the run going.</p><p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/CapsOffside\">@CapsOffside</a>:</p><p>It's all squad issues all the time here in Vancouver of late. Martin Rennie probably didn't think he'd run into this issue so early in the season, but you can't plan for injuries and form. An extended injury absence has made the fans' hearts grow very fond of Kenny Miller. He's out again for our trip to Dallas, which could mean trouble for the team, but we've looked pretty good of late, even though we haven't racked up a ton of points. </p><p>Our midfield is a point of contention, with everyone championing their favourite combination of players. Canadian Soccer Jesus Russell Teibert has come in and impressed, but that has pushed fan favourite Gershon Koffie to the bench. Meanwhile Davidson has come under fire. Will Rennie look at something different on the road in Dallas? Not likely.</p><p>Up front we have another squad issue, with new starter Corey Hertzog injured. That likely means a place back in the starting line-up for Darren Mattocks, who hasn't impressed lately.</p><p>At least we know that our backline and keeper will be the same. And that's a good thing, as they'll have to function extremely well as a team in order to keep out Dallas' potent attack, which comes from all directions. Not a great time for uncertainty in the squad. At this point I'm just hoping for some luck.</p><h2>Chicago Fire vs Columbus Crew</h2><p>Sat 8:30PM, Toyota Park</p><p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://fuegodemivida.com\">Fuego de mi Vida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p><p>The big news out of Fireland this week is word of an injury setback for German center back Arne Friedrich. There was an audible collective groan from the fans at this news and for good reason. The Fire have had a lot of injuries in the back this season and results have reflected this, with one win and 12 goals conceded. No team so far this season has let in more goals or has a worse goal difference. Friedrich makes everyone else around him better and his presence is sorely missed at the moment.</p><p>Against Houston last week, the Fire gave up two soft goals, with one clearly being the fault of poor marking from a cross. Luckily for the Fire, Brad Davis doesn't play for Columbus, but they have other strengths. The speed of Dom Oduro will be an interesting challenge for the Fire's defense. He will want to stick it to the Fire coaching staff for trading him in the offseason; a move I still agree with even though Oduro has 3 goals to his name this season. This isn't a must win, but another loss at home, especially against a conference rival, would mean that alarm bells would start ringing.</p><p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p><p>The biggest debate in Crewville continues to be who should start up top. Most supporters feel that it was wrong that Jairo Arrieta lost his starting spot after returning from national team duty a few weeks ago. However, no one can deny that Dominic Oduro has performed well since moving from the wing to the top of the formation. Last week's fantastic upper-ninety finish makes it hard to call for him to move back to the wing (especially as Ben Speas continues to play well out wide). One has to wonder if Coach Warzycha will consider changing the formation to incorporate two strikers so that the Crew can get its best eleven players on the field at once.</p><p>Heading into Chicago this weekend, may seem like a good time to try something new as the Fire are struggling greatly at the start of the season, managing only one win while amassing a negative 7 goal differential. However, the Crew have a history of terrible play in the Windy City with their last win at Toyota Park coming nearly seven years ago (6 loses and 3 ties during that time). I suspect we'll continue to see a defensive posture that uses Oduro's speed to create quick counter attacks. The result will likely be lackluster play from both teams resulting in a draw.</p><h2>Real Salt Lake vs Chivas USA</h2><p>Sat 9:00pm Rio Tinto Stadium</p><p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslperspective.com/\">RSL Perspective</a>:</p><p>After failing to get a result in Vancouver last weekend, Real Salt Lake will look to rebound in a major way with 3 straight home matches after starting out the season with 5 of their first 7 on the road. In the early season RSL has faced lost minutes from names like Alvaro Saborio, Robbie Findley, Kyle Beckerman, Javier Morales, Chris Wingert, and Nat Borchers. Now most of those players have either returned to full action or are close, and while it can take time to gain match fitness and sharpness, the extended home stand could help out.</p><p>Even with a 2-3-2 record, RSL haven't really been seriously outplayed in any of their matches and the last time at home they were simply electric against the Seattle Sounders in what has been the most exciting match I have seen in all of MLS so far this season. Chivas USA and RSL have a history of tough matches and the rivalry of both clubs joining MLS in the 2005 season. Last year RSL was dealt a 1-0 home loss by Chivas early in the season, but RSL was able to win both of the away matches in impressive style (3-0 & 4-0). This is a very different Chivas USA, but the question remains if they are as good as their early record (3-2-1) might suggest or is this just smoke and mirrors of a new coach and a lot of new players who are unprepared for the long haul that is the MLS season? I expect a tough match but RSL should be able to pick up a solid 2-0 win on Saturday.</p><p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p><p>The main story at Chivas USA this week has been the fallout from Saturday's 1-0 loss to the Colorado Rapids. It was probably the Goats' worst performance so far this season, and while they had a chance for a draw via a 1st half penalty kick, they blew it. As a result, the question is whether Chivas USA have been found out, or whether this was just a blip in what has otherwise been a strong start. I think the inclination among fans has been that this was likely a blip, since Chivas just didn't do the things they have been doing well so far this season: pressing opponents, making passage through the midfield difficult, and converting their chances. Missing Juan Agudelo for most of this match due to a hamstring injury certainly set the attack back. The hope heading into the next game is that Agudelo may perhaps be healthier (that is currently unclear) and also that another available striker can start producing, since both Jose Correa and Tristan Bowen have been among the only players to really struggle for the team.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Chivas play Real Salt Lake on the road this week. It won't be easy, and could make for another rough night, but RSL hasn't been invincible, and Chivas hasn't been as abject as in the past, so the Goats certainly have a shot. I think fans want to see an improved performance, and we'll go from there.</p><h2>LA Galaxy vs Sporting KC</h2><p>Sat 10:30PM, The Home Depot Center (NBCSN)</p><p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p><p>This weekend against Sporting KC it will be up to a defense that will have to play without Leonardo (Red Card Suspension) and an offense that may be forced to play without Irish international Robbie Keane (Left ankle injury). </p><p>The defense will be reinforced with either AJ DeLaGarza making the switch from right back to central defense or 2012 MLS Playoff standout Tommy Meyer. Injuries to Todd Dunivant in the CCL may preclude him from anchoring the left back role. In his absence expect Bryan Gaul or Greg Cochrane to fill in. </p><p>Ultimately it will come down to finishing. And finishing is something that has been greatly lacking in both losses to Monterrey and their last MLS loss to FC Dallas. Landon's form has been marginal since his return to the field and McBean and Villarreal have been putting shots on target but haven't found the net. Many feel that LA is looking for the perfect shot instead of just shooting. The Galaxy also need to maximize their advantage on set pieces with Omar Gonzalez. His height and his scoring ability should be utilized throughout every game. </p><p>With Juninho and Marcelo Saravas to lean upon the Galaxy midfield should be up to the task of keeping Sporting Kansas City from easily transitioning from the middle of the field. But in order to be successful they will need to find an answer for Graham Zusi and company on the wings.</p><p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p><p>Wednesday's win over New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena took Sporting KC top of the table in the Eastern Conference. It was an edge of your seat second half, with NYRB having several opportunities going just wide of goal. Sporting's back line proved it's worth once more, and goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen celebrated his 37th shut out, tying the club record with Tony Meola. Defender Aurelien Collin had a great game but not the best we've seen from him. Nonetheless, he made key tackles and scored the game's only goal. NYRB appeared frustrated, and Juninho made it clear when he kicked a ball at Nielsen's face after a dead play earning him a red card in stoppage time.</p><p>Sporting KC will now travel across the country to face LA Galaxy in Los Angeles. The Galaxy has been losing points left and right but have had a week to rest after loses to FC Dallas and Mexican side Monterrey in CONCACAF Champions League. Hungry for points, the Galaxy will present a test for Sporting, as it will work to breakdown the backline. Given that LA's defense has had several ball-watching episodes lately, Sporting KC may want to go on the attack, which will make for an exciting dynamic in the midfield. </p><h2>DC United vs Philadelphia Union</h2><p>Sun 5pm RFK Stadium (ESPN2)</p><p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p><p>Lost: United's offense, if found please return it to RFK or the nearest MLS facility. Bill Hamid revealed he was merely human, and United couldn't muster much against New York, and now the Ben Olsen has started to talk about it. Could it be unfair to not have faith in the offense with DeRosario only appearing in a handful of matches (he entered in the second half last week)? Maybe, but it seems as though United is looking hard at Casey Townsend who was acquired during the Chivas USA garage sale. Townsend, a local college product, has been on loan to the Richmond Kickers as part of the USL agreement, and scored twice there last week. So at least SOMEONE in the organization is scoring. So Olsen will start pushing buttons to find the attack. But will he find the right buttons and balance? United takes on Philadelphia in Sunday afternoon matchup. There's a rivalry spark in this game, too and marks the first time that the teams meet since the final pre-season game that had the DeRo/Cruz altercation that led to DeRo's two game suspension.</p><p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.phillysoccerpage.com\">Philly Soccer Page</a>, Philadelphia:</p><p>Union manager John Hackworth still hasn't played his best 11 together. Last Saturday, he started forwards Conor Casey, Jack McInerney, and Sebastien Le Toux together for the first time, with Le Toux deployed at left midfield. The three didn't flourish together, but blame likely lies less on them, as Hackworth said Wednesday, and than the midfield.</p><p>Philadelphia's midfield has lacked fluidity all season and looked no better Saturday, when their four most technically adept midfielders started the game on the bench.</p><p>The Union's primary problem may be poor play from the flanks. Danny Cruz has started five games at right midfield and impressed in none. Union fans admire his hustle and fearless play but have lost patience with the subpar technical ability and positional sense he's shown since arriving in Philadelphia last season. On the left, Le Toux showed once again that he's a far better striker than midfielder.</p><p>Twins Michael and Gabriel Farfan started Saturday's game on the bench but have routinely proved to be the team's best outside midfielders, though neither always plays there. Center midfielder Keon Daniel has played better when paired with the Farfans, as they offer more short passing options and one-on-one dribbling ability than Le Toux or Cruz, whose styles are based on runs behind defenders.</p><p>Hackworth continues to experiment with his lineup while balancing that by keeping his back six unchanged. Look for more of this Sunday against rivals D.C. United, when he could start newly acquired midfielder Kleberson for the first time.</p><h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Portland Timbers</h2><p>Sun 11:00PM, Buck Shaw Stadium (UniMas)</p><p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p><p>A week everyone associated with the San Jose Earthquakes wishes to forget from the President, Coach, Players and Fans. Quakes put out their Three-Headed Monster and it was tamed by the Timbers but not before Alan Gordon said an Anti-Gay slur to Will Johnson and summarily got a second yellow to be shown his marching orders to an early shower. The Quakes proceeded to lose not only the game but the reserve squad ended up losing to Portland too. During the latter match, the Quakes backup keeper David Bingham came up lame and had to be subbed out. On top of all this, the Portland Police are now looking for video/picture evidence of Quakes fans having an altercation with a Timbers' Army member which led to over $1000 worth of damage to his car and another black eye on the San Jose team. As for Alan Gordon, he immediately released an apology for his language (as did Quakes President Dave Kaval) and Don Garber quickly sentenced Gordon to sitting out an additional 3 matches, an undisclosed fine, and more Diversity and Sensitivity Training. </p><p>But all is not blight; injured Steven Beitashour played a full 45 minutes in the reserve match! The Honduran midfielder Pery Martinez notched his first goal in MLS for the Quakes during that 2 – 1 loss to Portland's reserve squad. And now mumblings out of training sounds as if recovering speedster Marvin Chavez might be ready to play this weekend too! Here's hoping for a quiet win!</p><p><strong>Michael Orr</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.maofootball.wordpress.com\">Mao Football</a>, host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/soccer-made-in-portland/\">Soccer made in PDX</a> podcast:</p><p>The Alan Gordon furore overshadowed everything else this week, with a lot of Timbers Army fans turning on him after his homophobic insult was caught on camera. Gordon's a former Timber and he's remembered fondly here for the occasional hat trick and grabbing the chainsaw to cut the log to celebrate his own goal. I think he's fundamentally a good guy and people will come round eventually if he's sincere in his apology and how he carries himself in the future, but for now his reputation is definitely tarnished.</p><p>The other story that's rather been overlooked is the Timbers' defense. Before the season started I think people would have thought Futty Danso would have been around number six or seven at best as a starting central defender, but there he was last week in a back line that's looking pretty thin. Silvestre played despite being listed as \"doubtful\" last week, and Andrew Jean-Baptiste was out. They could be down to Danso, who they don't seem to fancy that much, or possibly the rookie Tucker-Gangnes. It wasn't such a problem in Portland last week, but it might be the difference in San Jose with the Earthquakes getting more of their attacking players back from injury.</p><h2><a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&CTID=56\">MLS standings</a></h2><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls\">MLS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">US sports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/torontofc\">Toronto FC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/houstondynamo\">Houston Dynamo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/coloradorapids\">Colorado Rapids</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/seattle-sounders\">Seattle Sounders</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newyorkredbulls\">New York Red Bulls</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newenglandrevolution\">New England Revolution</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fcdallas\">FC Dallas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/vancouver-whitecaps\">Vancouver Whitecaps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/chicago-fire\">Chicago Fire</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/columbus-crew\">Columbus Crew</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realsaltlake\">Real Salt Lake</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chivasusa\">Chivas USA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/losangelesgalaxy\">LA Galaxy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sporting-kansas-city\">Sporting Kansas City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/dcunited\">DC United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/philadelphia-union\">Philadelphia Union</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/san-jose-earthquakes\">San Jose Earthquakes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/portland-timbers\">Portland Timbers</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graham-parker\">Graham Parker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As you'll see below, our regular Revs commenter Julie Kumor, was touched by the league-wide support for a club that was still processing the news of Kevin Alston's leukemia when Monday's tragedy happened. Players Matt Reis and Chris Tierney had loved-ones injured in the blast, and while sport is indeed a pretty trivial distraction at a time like this, the <strong>Revs</strong> will perhaps be glad of any such distraction as they visit <strong>New York</strong> on Saturday and try to get back to some sense of normality.</p><p>Before that game takes place <strong>Toronto</strong> will start the day off welcoming a <strong>Houston</strong> team who now stand alone in holding the longest unbeaten home record in the league. Though they're not at home this week, they're in Toronto — where the hosts have discovered the joys of scoring rather than conceding late, hauling back a 2-0 deficit in the last five minutes in their last home game against Supporters Shield leaders Dallas. <strong>Dallas</strong> will be back in action on Saturday against <strong>Vancouver</strong>, in their first of two successive games against the 'Caps. We may know more about both sides' long term credentials after that series, though we may also know a little more than we'd wished to about seating arrangements at the home stadium, as the club concludes their investigation into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/17/george-john-fc-dallas-bottle-head\">the incident that saw George John hit by a beer bottle last weekend</a>.</p><p><strong>Seattle</strong> would settle for the rather more prosaic activity of hitting the net - yet to win, the Sounders take their travails to <strong>Colorado</strong>, who checked the Chivas express last week and who have inched their stretched squad to within goal difference of the early playoff frontrunners. The Sounders aren't the only team who've been struggling for goals, though <strong>Chicago</strong> have rather broken their drought by scoring four in their last two. Not enough to get anything from their last game though, and they host a <strong>Crew</strong> side solidly tucked in behind the frontrunners, and who held the Impact to a 1-1 scoreline last week.</p><p><strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> continue to labor a little, though a point in Vancouver last time out was a decent result. They host a <strong>Chivas</strong> side who failed to really show up in their home loss to Colorado last week. For a Salt Lake team still in that dread phase of \"transition\", a similarly subdued perfromance from the goats would be very welcome. Don't count on it though. Meanwhile the <strong>Galaxy</strong> will try to get their disappointing result against Dallas out of the way when they host a <strong>Sporting KC</strong> side who are steadily easing into their stride. One thing the Galaxy have in their favor is that Sporting played in New York on Wednesday night, though the encouragement of a win that took them to the familiar summit of the Eastern standings may give the visitors some momentum on the long journey across the country to the Home Depot Center.</p><p>Two games on Sunday. An officially struggling<strong> DC</strong> take on a <strong>Philadelphia</strong> team unbeaten since a lackluster trip to New York last month, and coming off a rest week, though in the interests of balance it should be noted they haven't actually won a game since squeezing past New England 1-0 on March 16th. That game could be tight whatever way it goes. Finally, <strong>Portland</strong> travel to <strong>San Jose</strong> on Sunday night for what could be a fractious affair, after former Timber Alan Gordon landed <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/04/16/san-jose-earthquakes-forward-alan-gordon-gets-three-game-suspension-homophob\">a three match ban for homophobic comments</a> made during last week's game. Portland got the better of last week's game all round, after Will Johnson curled in a great free kick to win it, but back at San Jose, and with players coming back from injury, the Earthquakes may believe that Gordon or no Gordon, they can reverse the result. </p><p>As always, we've asked our usual cast of fan reps and writers to give us their take on the big stories at their clubs this week. See what they have to say below then give us your take on the week's events and what you think will happen this weekend. And we'll be back on Monday with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/mls-five-things-we-learned\">Five things we learned</a>.</p><p>All game times ET</p><h2>Toronto FC vs Houston Dynamo </h2><p>Sat 4:00PM, BMO Field (TSN)</p><p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>:</p><p>Toronto FC is not its own worst enemy. It's not the backline that kills the team, nor inconsistency of unmarked opposing players or the killer stoppage-time-equalizing-goal. No, Toronto's biggest enemy is the city's train system.<br />You see, trains depart from the stadium almost on the hour; therefore the train's schedule does not coincide with the length of a soccer game. In other words, if a game at BMO Field starts on the hour, those who take the GO Train either leave early or having to wait another full 60 minutes for the next train. And in bad weather, after a bad game, that can be a long 60 minutes.</p><p>However, the fans that chose comfort over the final whistle are doing themselves a disservice, as the most exciting part of a Toronto FC game is the last ten minutes. And this season, sometimes those exciting moments actually come from TFC.</p><p>In their last home again against FC Dallas, Toronto came back to draw 2–2 in the final minutes. Not only were there goals, but also bad calls, missed handballs, and general hullabaloo from the crowd. The last ten minutes of the game had more energy, emotion, and singing than the previous 80 combined. Of course, the complete opposite happened in their next game against Philadelphia Union. The lesson? On Saturday, stay for the whole match when they face Houston at BMO Field; Toronto FC will make it worth your while (disclaimer: no guarantee it will be in a positive way). </p><p><strong>Stephen Eastepp</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p><p>The Houston Dynamo secured a spot in the MLS history books with a big win over the Chicago Fire last weekend. With the win, they are now unbeaten in 35 straight home matches which is a pretty impressive feat. While there hasn't been incredible hype around the feat in Houston, the fans certainly were all over it and it really was a special moment for all of them.</p><p>Now the Dynamo turn their attention to the enemy – a road game. It really doesn't matter the opponent at this point, Houston just can't seem to figure out their problems away from BBVA Compass Stadium. This time, they'll travel to BMO Field to face Toronto FC who are hungry for a win after three straight draws.</p><p>Last time the Dynamo visited Toronto, they walked off the pitch with a 2-0 shutout win and their first ever victory at BMO Field. Hopefully some of that luck will carry over to Saturday's match. We're likely to see the same starting lineup that was fielded against Chicago, with Boniek Garcia still nursing an injury. I've been told Garcia will make the trip, but may be limited on playing time. Will Bruin and Giles Barnes are beginning to gel up front and I wouldn't be surprised to see both of them get on the scoreboard Saturday. The Dynamo defense will have their hands full with Robert Earnshaw and pulling of a win won't be easy. </p><h2>Colorado Rapids vs Seattle Sounders</h2><p>Sat 6:00PM, Dick's Sporting Goods Park</p><p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, <a href=\"http://c38sg.com\">Centennial 38 Supporters</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p><p>The Sounders are coming to town this weekend for a game that's already being dubbed the Cannabis Cup, as the two sides are in states where legalization has happened, and evidence that someone at MLS scheduling might have a sense of humor the game is being played on 4/20. </p><p>Even more bizarrely, the Rapids are on a streak - unbeaten in three and winning the last two, the second choice #rapkids are getting the job done. So much so that captain Drew Moor came back from suspension only as far as the bench last week, and with the way that rookie goalkeeper Clint Irwin is playing there's no guarantee Matt Pickens will come straight back into the team when he eventually returns from injury. Irwin has faced an MLS record 4 penalties in his first four games - going the right way on all of them and saving two (and four points with them). The Sounders have been having trouble scoring and against all the odds with all the injuries, the Rapids aren't conceding. We're even seeing light at the end of the tunnel with the injuries. Anthony Wallace is back after two years out, and Mastroeni and Rivero are back in full training.</p><p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.sounderatheart.com/\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p><p>Sounders FC has problems right now. The easy way to look at it is that they have yet to win an MLS game. Slightly deeper is to notice that they are not scoring goals, but the defense is still decent (Best XI Defensive Mids will do that). Taking it even deeper still is that they are getting shots at a mere average rate. Lastly, maybe the most worrisome stat is that is that Sigi Schmid has tried nine different players at forward.</p><p>There is some good news. The two of those forwards that are supposed to be the best — if salary equals talent — are both practicing again. A team that has trouble scoring goals that gets to reinsert Obafemi Martins and Eddie Johnson should get better at finding chances and converting chances to elusive goals.</p><p>Because that's what Seattle needs right now, probably even more than a win. A couple of goals would start to resurrect the meaning to a season that is teetering. The brink of a nothing year is right there. To pull away from that edge the club will need to take on a Colorado Rapids side that is also struggling and prone to weaknesses in the same areas where Seattle is strong. Three points would be best, but at this point a couple of goals may mean more.</p><h2>New York Red Bulls vs New England Revolution</h2><p>Sat 7:00PM, Red Bull Arena</p><p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p><p>The Red Bulls wrap up a three-game week on Saturday at home against the New England Revolution. New York will be feeling the after effects of a shutout loss against Kansas City on Wednesday, but there's really no shame in that given Sporting KC's performance as of late. The real issue is that head coach Mike Petke will again have to reshuffle the deck. Inconsistency is the only consistency with the Metros right now, through no fault of Petke's own. Defender and shock Golden Boot candidate Jamison Olave left Wednesday's game early with a hamstring issue. Juninho joined Olave in the locker room before full time after deciding that the one thing missing from Jimmy Nielsen's face was a driven soccer ball. Tack on Thierry Henry's arthritic knees and the short turnaround, and it may come down to picking eleven names from a hat and hoping for the best. If there is a time for a 'get healthy' game, it could be against the Revs, who come into Harrison having scored just one goal through five games. </p><p>As for New England, it's been a hard week. Please support Boston as best you can. If that includes financially, I recommend <a href=\"http://OneFundBoston.org\">OneFundBoston.org</a> or <a href=\"http://BosFireCU.com\">BosFireCU.com</a></p><p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p><p>Last week was a rough week for the entire New England Revolution family. With the news that Kevin Alston was diagnosed with Leukemia, I felt the warm embrace of the MLS community. I was overwhelmed with how other teams and players responded to the news, and hoped Kevin would get well. Saturday I went back to rooting for those guys on the field in Seattle. </p><p>Then Monday happened. As the news spread through my Boston friends, we were in shock. Again I heard from my fellow soccer fans from all over the country, and for the second time in two weeks, I felt the love and respect from my fellow fans, there was that embrace again. I reminded my friends back home that I was safe in Cambridge, this big old university doesn't get the day off, so I was a river away from the finish line. I was okay. </p><p>As the day played out, I heard stories of the injured and friends that had just been in the area moments before, it didn't seem real. Then it was. When the Revs confirmed that Matt Reis' father in law was among the critically injured, suddenly I wasn't okay. My soccer family was hurt directly by this tragedy. </p><p>I have spent more of the 2013 season rooting for my boys off the field, and hope the healing starts on Saturday when 200 us travel to Red Bull Arena. We can finally cheer for our boys on the field away from home, show our soccer family we are strong.</p><h2>FC Dallas vs Vancouver Whitecaps</h2><p>Sat 8:30PM, FC Dallas Stadium</p><p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p><p>The main story all week would have to be \"Beergate\". I really wish it was beating LA but it's not. Obviously <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/apr/17/george-john-fc-dallas-bottle-head\">I spoke to the Guardian earlier this week</a> about how embarrassing it is for us as fans that this happened — the one silver lining being that it turned out that the culprit was not a member of any of the supporters' groups. He can count himself lucky George John didn't press charges and all he got was a charge of public intoxication, but as of right now the club hasn't confirmed what they're going to do in response other than getting rid of aluminum bottles (which the supporters group leaders themselves said were a bad idea at the start of the season).</p><p>To try and move on to the soccer, it was a hard fought, tense win against LA, but a really important one in proving we're genuine challengers. Now we go into the first part of a home and away sequence against Vancouver, and I'm hoping we ride some momentum from the LA game, because the Canadian sides have really improved this season. Toronto gave us a hard time at BMO Field and Vancouver look solid again. But I think we'll keep the run going.</p><p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/CapsOffside\">@CapsOffside</a>:</p><p>It's all squad issues all the time here in Vancouver of late. Martin Rennie probably didn't think he'd run into this issue so early in the season, but you can't plan for injuries and form. An extended injury absence has made the fans' hearts grow very fond of Kenny Miller. He's out again for our trip to Dallas, which could mean trouble for the team, but we've looked pretty good of late, even though we haven't racked up a ton of points. </p><p>Our midfield is a point of contention, with everyone championing their favourite combination of players. Canadian Soccer Jesus Russell Teibert has come in and impressed, but that has pushed fan favourite Gershon Koffie to the bench. Meanwhile Davidson has come under fire. Will Rennie look at something different on the road in Dallas? Not likely.</p><p>Up front we have another squad issue, with new starter Corey Hertzog injured. That likely means a place back in the starting line-up for Darren Mattocks, who hasn't impressed lately.</p><p>At least we know that our backline and keeper will be the same. And that's a good thing, as they'll have to function extremely well as a team in order to keep out Dallas' potent attack, which comes from all directions. Not a great time for uncertainty in the squad. At this point I'm just hoping for some luck.</p><h2>Chicago Fire vs Columbus Crew</h2><p>Sat 8:30PM, Toyota Park</p><p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://fuegodemivida.com\">Fuego de mi Vida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p><p>The big news out of Fireland this week is word of an injury setback for German center back Arne Friedrich. There was an audible collective groan from the fans at this news and for good reason. The Fire have had a lot of injuries in the back this season and results have reflected this, with one win and 12 goals conceded. No team so far this season has let in more goals or has a worse goal difference. Friedrich makes everyone else around him better and his presence is sorely missed at the moment.</p><p>Against Houston last week, the Fire gave up two soft goals, with one clearly being the fault of poor marking from a cross. Luckily for the Fire, Brad Davis doesn't play for Columbus, but they have other strengths. The speed of Dom Oduro will be an interesting challenge for the Fire's defense. He will want to stick it to the Fire coaching staff for trading him in the offseason; a move I still agree with even though Oduro has 3 goals to his name this season. This isn't a must win, but another loss at home, especially against a conference rival, would mean that alarm bells would start ringing.</p><p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p><p>The biggest debate in Crewville continues to be who should start up top. Most supporters feel that it was wrong that Jairo Arrieta lost his starting spot after returning from national team duty a few weeks ago. However, no one can deny that Dominic Oduro has performed well since moving from the wing to the top of the formation. Last week's fantastic upper-ninety finish makes it hard to call for him to move back to the wing (especially as Ben Speas continues to play well out wide). One has to wonder if Coach Warzycha will consider changing the formation to incorporate two strikers so that the Crew can get its best eleven players on the field at once.</p><p>Heading into Chicago this weekend, may seem like a good time to try something new as the Fire are struggling greatly at the start of the season, managing only one win while amassing a negative 7 goal differential. However, the Crew have a history of terrible play in the Windy City with their last win at Toyota Park coming nearly seven years ago (6 loses and 3 ties during that time). I suspect we'll continue to see a defensive posture that uses Oduro's speed to create quick counter attacks. The result will likely be lackluster play from both teams resulting in a draw.</p><h2>Real Salt Lake vs Chivas USA</h2><p>Sat 9:00pm Rio Tinto Stadium</p><p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslperspective.com/\">RSL Perspective</a>:</p><p>After failing to get a result in Vancouver last weekend, Real Salt Lake will look to rebound in a major way with 3 straight home matches after starting out the season with 5 of their first 7 on the road. In the early season RSL has faced lost minutes from names like Alvaro Saborio, Robbie Findley, Kyle Beckerman, Javier Morales, Chris Wingert, and Nat Borchers. Now most of those players have either returned to full action or are close, and while it can take time to gain match fitness and sharpness, the extended home stand could help out.</p><p>Even with a 2-3-2 record, RSL haven't really been seriously outplayed in any of their matches and the last time at home they were simply electric against the Seattle Sounders in what has been the most exciting match I have seen in all of MLS so far this season. Chivas USA and RSL have a history of tough matches and the rivalry of both clubs joining MLS in the 2005 season. Last year RSL was dealt a 1-0 home loss by Chivas early in the season, but RSL was able to win both of the away matches in impressive style (3-0 & 4-0). This is a very different Chivas USA, but the question remains if they are as good as their early record (3-2-1) might suggest or is this just smoke and mirrors of a new coach and a lot of new players who are unprepared for the long haul that is the MLS season? I expect a tough match but RSL should be able to pick up a solid 2-0 win on Saturday.</p><p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p><p>The main story at Chivas USA this week has been the fallout from Saturday's 1-0 loss to the Colorado Rapids. It was probably the Goats' worst performance so far this season, and while they had a chance for a draw via a 1st half penalty kick, they blew it. As a result, the question is whether Chivas USA have been found out, or whether this was just a blip in what has otherwise been a strong start. I think the inclination among fans has been that this was likely a blip, since Chivas just didn't do the things they have been doing well so far this season: pressing opponents, making passage through the midfield difficult, and converting their chances. Missing Juan Agudelo for most of this match due to a hamstring injury certainly set the attack back. The hope heading into the next game is that Agudelo may perhaps be healthier (that is currently unclear) and also that another available striker can start producing, since both Jose Correa and Tristan Bowen have been among the only players to really struggle for the team.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Chivas play Real Salt Lake on the road this week. It won't be easy, and could make for another rough night, but RSL hasn't been invincible, and Chivas hasn't been as abject as in the past, so the Goats certainly have a shot. I think fans want to see an improved performance, and we'll go from there.</p><h2>LA Galaxy vs Sporting KC</h2><p>Sat 10:30PM, The Home Depot Center (NBCSN)</p><p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p><p>This weekend against Sporting KC it will be up to a defense that will have to play without Leonardo (Red Card Suspension) and an offense that may be forced to play without Irish international Robbie Keane (Left ankle injury). </p><p>The defense will be reinforced with either AJ DeLaGarza making the switch from right back to central defense or 2012 MLS Playoff standout Tommy Meyer. Injuries to Todd Dunivant in the CCL may preclude him from anchoring the left back role. In his absence expect Bryan Gaul or Greg Cochrane to fill in. </p><p>Ultimately it will come down to finishing. And finishing is something that has been greatly lacking in both losses to Monterrey and their last MLS loss to FC Dallas. Landon's form has been marginal since his return to the field and McBean and Villarreal have been putting shots on target but haven't found the net. Many feel that LA is looking for the perfect shot instead of just shooting. The Galaxy also need to maximize their advantage on set pieces with Omar Gonzalez. His height and his scoring ability should be utilized throughout every game. </p><p>With Juninho and Marcelo Saravas to lean upon the Galaxy midfield should be up to the task of keeping Sporting Kansas City from easily transitioning from the middle of the field. But in order to be successful they will need to find an answer for Graham Zusi and company on the wings.</p><p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p><p>Wednesday's win over New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena took Sporting KC top of the table in the Eastern Conference. It was an edge of your seat second half, with NYRB having several opportunities going just wide of goal. Sporting's back line proved it's worth once more, and goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen celebrated his 37th shut out, tying the club record with Tony Meola. Defender Aurelien Collin had a great game but not the best we've seen from him. Nonetheless, he made key tackles and scored the game's only goal. NYRB appeared frustrated, and Juninho made it clear when he kicked a ball at Nielsen's face after a dead play earning him a red card in stoppage time.</p><p>Sporting KC will now travel across the country to face LA Galaxy in Los Angeles. The Galaxy has been losing points left and right but have had a week to rest after loses to FC Dallas and Mexican side Monterrey in CONCACAF Champions League. Hungry for points, the Galaxy will present a test for Sporting, as it will work to breakdown the backline. Given that LA's defense has had several ball-watching episodes lately, Sporting KC may want to go on the attack, which will make for an exciting dynamic in the midfield. </p><h2>DC United vs Philadelphia Union</h2><p>Sun 5pm RFK Stadium (ESPN2)</p><p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p><p>Lost: United's offense, if found please return it to RFK or the nearest MLS facility. Bill Hamid revealed he was merely human, and United couldn't muster much against New York, and now the Ben Olsen has started to talk about it. Could it be unfair to not have faith in the offense with DeRosario only appearing in a handful of matches (he entered in the second half last week)? Maybe, but it seems as though United is looking hard at Casey Townsend who was acquired during the Chivas USA garage sale. Townsend, a local college product, has been on loan to the Richmond Kickers as part of the USL agreement, and scored twice there last week. So at least SOMEONE in the organization is scoring. So Olsen will start pushing buttons to find the attack. But will he find the right buttons and balance? United takes on Philadelphia in Sunday afternoon matchup. There's a rivalry spark in this game, too and marks the first time that the teams meet since the final pre-season game that had the DeRo/Cruz altercation that led to DeRo's two game suspension.</p><p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.phillysoccerpage.com\">Philly Soccer Page</a>, Philadelphia:</p><p>Union manager John Hackworth still hasn't played his best 11 together. Last Saturday, he started forwards Conor Casey, Jack McInerney, and Sebastien Le Toux together for the first time, with Le Toux deployed at left midfield. The three didn't flourish together, but blame likely lies less on them, as Hackworth said Wednesday, and than the midfield.</p><p>Philadelphia's midfield has lacked fluidity all season and looked no better Saturday, when their four most technically adept midfielders started the game on the bench.</p><p>The Union's primary problem may be poor play from the flanks. Danny Cruz has started five games at right midfield and impressed in none. Union fans admire his hustle and fearless play but have lost patience with the subpar technical ability and positional sense he's shown since arriving in Philadelphia last season. On the left, Le Toux showed once again that he's a far better striker than midfielder.</p><p>Twins Michael and Gabriel Farfan started Saturday's game on the bench but have routinely proved to be the team's best outside midfielders, though neither always plays there. Center midfielder Keon Daniel has played better when paired with the Farfans, as they offer more short passing options and one-on-one dribbling ability than Le Toux or Cruz, whose styles are based on runs behind defenders.</p><p>Hackworth continues to experiment with his lineup while balancing that by keeping his back six unchanged. Look for more of this Sunday against rivals D.C. United, when he could start newly acquired midfielder Kleberson for the first time.</p><h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Portland Timbers</h2><p>Sun 11:00PM, Buck Shaw Stadium (UniMas)</p><p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p><p>A week everyone associated with the San Jose Earthquakes wishes to forget from the President, Coach, Players and Fans. Quakes put out their Three-Headed Monster and it was tamed by the Timbers but not before Alan Gordon said an Anti-Gay slur to Will Johnson and summarily got a second yellow to be shown his marching orders to an early shower. The Quakes proceeded to lose not only the game but the reserve squad ended up losing to Portland too. During the latter match, the Quakes backup keeper David Bingham came up lame and had to be subbed out. On top of all this, the Portland Police are now looking for video/picture evidence of Quakes fans having an altercation with a Timbers' Army member which led to over $1000 worth of damage to his car and another black eye on the San Jose team. As for Alan Gordon, he immediately released an apology for his language (as did Quakes President Dave Kaval) and Don Garber quickly sentenced Gordon to sitting out an additional 3 matches, an undisclosed fine, and more Diversity and Sensitivity Training. </p><p>But all is not blight; injured Steven Beitashour played a full 45 minutes in the reserve match! The Honduran midfielder Pery Martinez notched his first goal in MLS for the Quakes during that 2 – 1 loss to Portland's reserve squad. And now mumblings out of training sounds as if recovering speedster Marvin Chavez might be ready to play this weekend too! Here's hoping for a quiet win!</p><p><strong>Michael Orr</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.maofootball.wordpress.com\">Mao Football</a>, host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/soccer-made-in-portland/\">Soccer made in PDX</a> podcast:</p><p>The Alan Gordon furore overshadowed everything else this week, with a lot of Timbers Army fans turning on him after his homophobic insult was caught on camera. Gordon's a former Timber and he's remembered fondly here for the occasional hat trick and grabbing the chainsaw to cut the log to celebrate his own goal. I think he's fundamentally a good guy and people will come round eventually if he's sincere in his apology and how he carries himself in the future, but for now his reputation is definitely tarnished.</p><p>The other story that's rather been overlooked is the Timbers' defense. Before the season started I think people would have thought Futty Danso would have been around number six or seven at best as a starting central defender, but there he was last week in a back line that's looking pretty thin. Silvestre played despite being listed as \"doubtful\" last week, and Andrew Jean-Baptiste was out. They could be down to Danso, who they don't seem to fancy that much, or possibly the rookie Tucker-Gangnes. It wasn't such a problem in Portland last week, but it might be the difference in San Jose with the Earthquakes getting more of their attacking players back from injury.</p><h2><a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&CTID=56\">MLS standings</a></h2><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls\">MLS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">US sports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/torontofc\">Toronto FC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/houstondynamo\">Houston Dynamo</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/coloradorapids\">Colorado Rapids</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/seattle-sounders\">Seattle Sounders</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newyorkredbulls\">New York Red Bulls</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newenglandrevolution\">New England Revolution</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fcdallas\">FC Dallas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/vancouver-whitecaps\">Vancouver Whitecaps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/chicago-fire\">Chicago Fire</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/columbus-crew\">Columbus Crew</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realsaltlake\">Real Salt Lake</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chivasusa\">Chivas USA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/losangelesgalaxy\">LA Galaxy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sporting-kansas-city\">Sporting Kansas City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/dcunited\">DC United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/philadelphia-union\">Philadelphia Union</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/san-jose-earthquakes\">San Jose Earthquakes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/portland-timbers\">Portland Timbers</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graham-parker\">Graham Parker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was jovial – people were happy, clapping – and getting to a point where it gets a little boring as a photographer. And then we heard this explosion.\" These words are from Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki, who has covered more than 20 marathons in his home city. The joyous, celebratory, almost party-like finish area was suddenly transformed into a scene of devastation and destruction. This made me think: for more than 20 years I have been photographing the London Marathon finish; how would I react to a similar scenario? </p><p>The Boston bombings happened exactly 24 years to the day after another sporting occasion was transformed into a scene of death and carnage – the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989. At the time I was about to leave college; a year later, and I may have been covering that match. At the time I was about to leave college – a year later and I may have been at that match. But, ever since that day, I have wondered what I would have done as a photographer when the match was stopped and the horror in the Leppings Lane End unfolded. </p><p>I have revisited some of the pictures taken at Hillsborough. They are shocking. Time hasn't lessened their impact, especially the images of dying fans pinned up against the fencing. At the time there was quite a debate over these pictures and whether they should have been taken and eventually seen in public. Some photographers were heavily criticised for taking pictures there. But later some of the images were used in the Taylor Report that brought an end to terracing and the fencing-in of supporters. The FBI have asked for photos taken in the aftermath of the bombs on Monday to help in their investigation. If the photographers can't actually help in some way, be it first-aid or similar, then shouldn't they document the scenes and then pass the decision of whether to publish them on to their editors?</p><p>I am mainly a sports photographer and I go to events with a predetermined mindset. Even though I don't know exactly what is going to happen, I have a rough idea. Just as a war or news photographer should be mentally attuned to what they are likely to see, I am similarly prepared. I am certainly not ready for bombs and violence to erupt in the arenas where I work. I don't go to work in a bulletproof vest and helmet, I go with a fishing stool and a 500m lens (not the best lens in a riot). </p><p>But I am employed by a newspaper and I realise that I have to be adaptable, so there has been the odd time when I have stepped over the line and into hard news. In 1996 I was called away from snooker at Wembley to get to the IRA Canary Wharf bombing – quite a mood shift there. In Marseille at the World Cup of 1998, I found myself, regrettably without an anti-teargas mask, in the middle of a full-scale riot between French police, local Tunisians and visiting England fans. On the day Princess Diana died, my football match was cancelled and I was sent down to Harrods to see people laying flowers, where I was spat at and blamed for her death: possession of a large pro camera marked me down as \"paparazzi scum\". But with all these examples I had some time to prepare for what I was going to see. With Boston and Hillsborough that would not have been the case.</p><p>I suppose it may come down to instinct. As Tlumacki said on Monday: \"My instinct was: no matter what it is, you're a photographer first; that's what you are doing.\" In a similar vein, another photographer at the Boston marathon, Bill Hoenk, mentioned going \"into a zone\". He continued: \"I was horrified by what I was seeing, but there was some sort of instinct that said: 'Don't worry about that, just keep shooting.'\"</p><p>So, what would my instinct be in such a situation? I feel it's a fine dividing line, achieving a delicate balance between helping someone in need but also recording the situation without exploiting it. Under extreme pressure that sort of call is very hard to make.

It wasn't nominated for anything, per se, even though there was a category for The Least Funny Tea-time Email, and it wasn't invited, per se, but it still went to one. Admittedly it had to wear a cunning disguise – no one recognises the Fiver in a suit, unless it's in court – to sneak past the heavies on the door and it was later chucked out after staging a one-man protest when the gongs were being handed out, but still, what a night 8 November 1997 was! With that in mind, the Fiver understands all too well how Gareth Bale, Michael Carrick, Eden Hazard, Juan Mata, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie are feeling after they were named on the PFA's shortlist for Player of the Year. Panicked. They've got to get new suits, practise their acceptance speech, unless they're Michael Carrick, and practise their rictus grin/grudging applause combo if they lose, especially if they're Michael Carrick.</p><p></p><p>That's harsh on Carrick, isn't it? He's been excellent. He's not going to win, and nor are Eden Hazard and Juan Mata. It's between Gareth Bale, the star of Gareth Bale and The Hotspurs, Robin van Persie and Luis Suárez. Suárez? Boo! Hiss! However unlike Sports Personality of the Year, the PFA doesn't dish this one out based on who has the best personality, which would see Mata win. It's who's had the best season and, after careful consideration which consisted of closing its eyes and picking a name out of a hat, The Fiver has decided to give Suárez its imaginary vote and Liverpool's manager, Brentan Rodgers, is backing his player too. \"There isn't a club in the country who wouldn't want Suárez in their team. He'd be the favourite for me,\" said Rodgers, somehow resisting the urge to say \"myself\" instead of \"me\".</p><p></p><p>Some have claimed that Suárez's past misdemeanours mean that the quality of his football shouldn't be recognised, which is clearly total pish, and he has been defended by the PFA's head honcho Gordon Taylor. \"Sometimes controversy travels with players,\" said Taylor. \"Sometimes it is in their very nature. Sometimes it is that very intensity that causes a problem also makes sure they win.\" Admittedly that doesn't quite excuse the diving and the eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 but can't we all just get along? This isn't meant to be a popularity contest, although it should be pointed out that Suárez's intensity has only allowed Liverpool to win 13 of their 33 league matches. And when you put it like that, it's a disgrace that nice, useless Fernando Torres hasn't been nominated.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"He said we should go on holiday, making a gesture with his hand\" – Jorge Pellicier, manager of the Chilean champions Huachipato, is irked by the hitherto little-known go-on-holiday hand gesture of Grêmio head coach Verderlei Luxemburgo after the sides' Copa Libertadores fixture <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2013/apr/19/copa-libertadores-brawl-gremio-huachipato-video\" title=\"\">ended in this right old ruckus</a>.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"I would like to add a second tier of pedantry to Jamie Milne's letter on a suitable Cardiff mascot today (yesterday's Letters).

An ideal mascot for crowd 'banter'\" – James Marsden.</p><p></p><p>\"All the chat about Indonesia and Malaysia in the first two pedantgrams (yesterday's Letters) made me read 'gargantuan error' as 'orangutan error' and assume you'd managed to hire some higher-calibre recruits to the Fiver's writing team to join your infinite number of monkeys. I was disappointed when I realised my mistake, but thought I'd pass it on anyway in case you're looking for tips when you're next hiring\" – Jon Gerrard.</p><p></p><p>\"As I was sat reading yesterday's Fiver over a large plate of nasi goreng in Kuala Lumpur I came across a letter from a Rob Jordan claiming that said dish was Indonesian! Bahasa is spoken in both Malaysia and Indonesia (albeit with differences) but without doubt nasi goreng (meaning fried rice) is Malaysian.

It wasn't nominated for anything, per se, even though there was a category for The Least Funny Tea-time Email, and it wasn't invited, per se, but it still went to one. Admittedly it had to wear a cunning disguise – no one recognises the Fiver in a suit, unless it's in court – to sneak past the heavies on the door and it was later chucked out after staging a one-man protest when the gongs were being handed out, but still, what a night 8 November 1997 was! With that in mind, the Fiver understands all too well how Gareth Bale, Michael Carrick, Eden Hazard, Juan Mata, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie are feeling after they were named on the PFA's shortlist for Player of the Year. Panicked. They've got to get new suits, practise their acceptance speech, unless they're Michael Carrick, and practise their rictus grin/grudging applause combo if they lose, especially if they're Michael Carrick.</p><p></p><p>That's harsh on Carrick, isn't it? He's been excellent. He's not going to win, and nor are Eden Hazard and Juan Mata. It's between Gareth Bale, the star of Gareth Bale and The Hotspurs, Robin van Persie and Luis Suárez. Suárez? Boo! Hiss! However unlike Sports Personality of the Year, the PFA doesn't dish this one out based on who has the best personality, which would see Mata win. It's who's had the best season and, after careful consideration which consisted of closing its eyes and picking a name out of a hat, The Fiver has decided to give Suárez its imaginary vote and Liverpool's manager, Brentan Rodgers, is backing his player too. \"There isn't a club in the country who wouldn't want Suárez in their team. He'd be the favourite for me,\" said Rodgers, somehow resisting the urge to say \"myself\" instead of \"me\".</p><p></p><p>Some have claimed that Suárez's past misdemeanours mean that the quality of his football shouldn't be recognised, which is clearly total pish, and he has been defended by the PFA's head honcho Gordon Taylor. \"Sometimes controversy travels with players,\" said Taylor. \"Sometimes it is in their very nature. Sometimes it is that very intensity that causes a problem also makes sure they win.\" Admittedly that doesn't quite excuse the diving and the eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 but can't we all just get along? This isn't meant to be a popularity contest, although it should be pointed out that Suárez's intensity has only allowed Liverpool to win 13 of their 33 league matches. And when you put it like that, it's a disgrace that nice, useless Fernando Torres hasn't been nominated.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"He said we should go on holiday, making a gesture with his hand\" – Jorge Pellicier, manager of the Chilean champions Huachipato, is irked by the hitherto little-known go-on-holiday hand gesture of Grêmio head coach Verderlei Luxemburgo after the sides' Copa Libertadores fixture <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2013/apr/19/copa-libertadores-brawl-gremio-huachipato-video\" title=\"\">ended in this right old ruckus</a>.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"I would like to add a second tier of pedantry to Jamie Milne's letter on a suitable Cardiff mascot today (yesterday's Letters). We don't have native bluebirds (native to the Americas) in the UK, rather blue tits. An ideal mascot for crowd 'banter'\" – James Marsden.</p><p></p><p>\"All the chat about Indonesia and Malaysia in the first two pedantgrams (yesterday's Letters) made me read 'gargantuan error' as 'orangutan error' and assume you'd managed to hire some higher-calibre recruits to the Fiver's writing team to join your infinite number of monkeys. I was disappointed when I realised my mistake, but thought I'd pass it on anyway in case you're looking for tips when you're next hiring\" – Jon Gerrard.</p><p></p><p>\"As I was sat reading yesterday's Fiver over a large plate of nasi goreng in Kuala Lumpur I came across a letter from a Rob Jordan claiming that said dish was Indonesian! Bahasa is spoken in both Malaysia and Indonesia (albeit with differences) but without doubt nasi goreng (meaning fried rice) is Malaysian. Just like Cardiff\" – Chris Prior.</p><p></p><p>\"It was good to see Barry Rogerson go with the tried and tested 'some of my best friends are animals' defence. (Wednesday's Quote Of The Day).

And to be fair to him, he probably does have a bespoke Highway Code to go along with his equatorial waistline, gravitational pull, turning circle of an ocean liner etc. and the like\" – Steven Dunne.</p><p></p><p>\"So I suppose PSG's loss to Evian in the French Cup pours cold water on the idea that they are a team capable of winning major honours?\" – Seamus Scanlon.</p><p></p><p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">the.boss@guardian.co.uk</a>.

Dante's team had just won the Bundesliga title with six games to spare but celebrations were disappointingly muted. With the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus three days away, the club had decided this was not the time for festivities. Ritual Bavarian \"beer showers\" and the donning of naff T-shirts were ruled out. However, Dante, a first‑time winner of the German league, could not help&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The 29-year-old broke ranks to climb up a fence in front of the Bayern block, swapped his shirt for a plastic version of the <em>Meisterschale</em> (the championship bowl) with one fan, then ran back on to the pitch waving his bounty around with a touching, child-like euphoria. \"The club want to put this thing in the museum but at the moment it's in my house,\" he says.</p><p>That bit of unfiltered joy cemented his status as the Munich supporters' new cult hero, and it has also become the defining image of Bayern's campaign thus far. It might have been the wrong trophy (Bayern will be handed the genuine article after their home game against Augsburg on 11 May) but it was certainly the right player. Dante, a defender of quiet, unassuming elegance and unshakeable calmness, has become the unlikely figurehead for a team on the brink of a historic treble. To be sure, fellow Bayern new boys Javier Martínez, the €40m midfielder from Athletic Bilbao, and the tireless striker Mario Mandzukic (€13m from Wolfsburg) have also added fine layers of quality that last year's beaten finalists might have been missing, but it is Dante's dependability, athleticism and passing that have taken Jupp Heynckes's side that extra step further. His skill set&nbsp;has enabled them to add some high, opponent-unnerving pressing to their game.</p><p>Next stop: the first leg in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona on Tuesday and for Dante the task of keeping Lionel Messi quiet. \"He can do amazing things, he is the best player in the world,\" he says, matter-of-factly. The lack of any discernible sense of excitement is perhaps due to his strong belief that this season Bayern really do not have to fear anyone. \"Barcelona have a great team, the greatest show on earth. But we are at our best at this moment in time, and we certainly won't change our game for them. We don't change for anyone.\" He adds that Barcelona's recent performances in the away games to Milan (a 2-0 defeat) and Paris Saint-Germain (2-2) have shown \"that they concede goals\".</p><p>So do Bayern, at least in Europe – 10 in 10 games. But in the league their figures look impossibly good. A mere \"13\" in the \"against\" column after 29 games tells of a superiority that has at times unsettled even themselves. \"Our training sessions are often more intense than the matches,\" Dante admitted recently, but he is quick to channel praise away from himself and towards the team's collective endeavour. \"We play as a unit, we're incredibly compact,\" he says. \"When you get so much protection from midfield it's actually easy to play as defender.\"</p><p>He recalls his previous stint at Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he would find himself \"maybe four or five times\" one-on-one with a striker. \"At Bayern, it might happen once in the game.\" He singles out French winger Franck Ribéry (\"he's a super funny guy with a great sense of humour, but on the pitch he always fights, he wants to win, win, win\") and Bastian Schweinsteiger, the team's midfield linchpin. \"He's the maestro, he controls the tempo and flow of the whole ensemble.\"</p><p>But Bayern's strong squad and Heynckes's tactical tweaks are not the only important factors. Dante, who arrived at the club a few days after the traumatic defeat at the hands of Chelsea in their own ground in the Champions League final last May, feels that his team-mates have been spurred on by the disappointment. \"Everything that has happened has made the team stronger,\" he says.</p><p>The club hierarchy had feared the opposite might happen. They installed the almost comically dour martinet Matthias Sammer as a sporting director to prevent a lame-duck scenario. At 67, Heynckes, soon to be replaced by Pep Guardiola, was always likely to retire in the summer. What they did not anticipate was just how well Heynckes would handle the dressing room in light of his rotation policy. Dante can take some credit for the great mood in the camp, as well. His professional but relaxed attitude has rubbed off on everyone, to the point that he is now seen as one of the team's indispensable leaders. \"I've never seen such a positive player,\" says the club's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"He drives into training with a smile and he leaves with a smile.\" Local media have started to referring to him as the <em>Abwehrchef</em>, the boss at the back. \"He's been a bullseye addition,\" says Heynckes.</p><p>At home they have woken up to his talents, too. Dante won his first call-up for the 2-1 friendly defeat by England in February, after which Luiz Felipe Scolari called him \"a defender for the future of the <em>Selecão</em>\". Recognition has taken its time. As a youngster Dante Bonfim Costa Santos failed to impress at a series of trials with clubs in Brazil's north-east. His father, an art restorer (\"he named me after the poet\") urged him to give up on his dream as they could no longer support him financially. The 17-year-old sold his video console to pay for the bus fare from his native Salvador to try his luck at Juventude in the south of the country. \"He was surprised when I called him from there, asking him to send me money for clothes because it was so cold,\" he says, chuckling.</p><p>Juventude took a chance on him and in 2002 he was sold to Lille. Communication problems nearly caused a riot in the hotel restaurant. \"They asked whether the food was good but I thought they wanted to know whether I wanted more. When I said no, the chef came out to remonstrate with me and everyone got very upset.\"</p><p>He moved on to Charleroi in Belgium in 2006. A year later, he was picked up by Standard Liège. He played alongside fellow afro-aficionado Marouane Fellaini and missed a penalty in the Champions League qualification play-off against Liverpool in 2009.</p><p>That December, Gladbach came calling. Dante played very well for the Foals but few realised the full extent of this late developer's talent. When Bayern triggered his release clause of €4.7m after a tip-off from their Brazilian right-back Rafinha, the headline of a press agency introduced him as the Reds' new \"<em>Schnäppchen-Verteidiger</em>\", a bargain defender.</p><p>\"I was bought to challenge the players they already had,\" Dante says. But he always believed that he could be much more than a squad player. \"You won't regret this,\" he told Rummenigge the moment after signing his contract. They certainly have not.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\">Bayern Munich</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bundesligafootball\">Bundesliga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball\">European club football</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/raphaelhonigstein\">Raphael Honigstein</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But we are at our best at this moment in time, and we certainly won't change our game for them. We don't change for anyone.\" He adds that Barcelona's recent performances in the away games to Milan (a 2-0 defeat) and Paris Saint-Germain (2-2) have shown \"that they concede goals\".</p><p>So do Bayern, at least in Europe – 10 in 10 games. But in the league their figures look impossibly good. A mere \"13\" in the \"against\" column after 29 games tells of a superiority that has at times unsettled even themselves. \"Our training sessions are often more intense than the matches,\" Dante admitted recently, but he is quick to channel praise away from himself and towards the team's collective endeavour. \"We play as a unit, we're incredibly compact,\" he says. \"When you get so much protection from midfield it's actually easy to play as defender.\"</p><p>He recalls his previous stint at Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he would find himself \"maybe four or five times\" one-on-one with a striker. \"At Bayern, it might happen once in the game.\" He singles out French winger Franck Ribéry (\"he's a super funny guy with a great sense of humour, but on the pitch he always fights, he wants to win, win, win\") and Bastian Schweinsteiger, the team's midfield linchpin. \"He's the maestro, he controls the tempo and flow of the whole ensemble.\"</p><p>But Bayern's strong squad and Heynckes's tactical tweaks are not the only important factors. Dante, who arrived at the club a few days after the traumatic defeat at the hands of Chelsea in their own ground in the Champions League final last May, feels that his team-mates have been spurred on by the disappointment. \"Everything that has happened has made the team stronger,\" he says.</p><p>The club hierarchy had feared the opposite might happen. They installed the almost comically dour martinet Matthias Sammer as a sporting director to prevent a lame-duck scenario. At 67, Heynckes, soon to be replaced by Pep Guardiola, was always likely to retire in the summer. What they did not anticipate was just how well Heynckes would handle the dressing room in light of his rotation policy. Dante can take some credit for the great mood in the camp, as well. His professional but relaxed attitude has rubbed off on everyone, to the point that he is now seen as one of the team's indispensable leaders. \"I've never seen such a positive player,\" says the club's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"He drives into training with a smile and he leaves with a smile.\" Local media have started to referring to him as the <em>Abwehrchef</em>, the boss at the back. \"He's been a bullseye addition,\" says Heynckes.</p><p>At home they have woken up to his talents, too. Dante won his first call-up for the 2-1 friendly defeat by England in February, after which Luiz Felipe Scolari called him \"a defender for the future of the <em>Selecão</em>\". Recognition has taken its time. As a youngster Dante Bonfim Costa Santos failed to impress at a series of trials with clubs in Brazil's north-east. His father, an art restorer (\"he named me after the poet\") urged him to give up on his dream as they could no longer support him financially. The 17-year-old sold his video console to pay for the bus fare from his native Salvador to try his luck at Juventude in the south of the country. \"He was surprised when I called him from there, asking him to send me money for clothes because it was so cold,\" he says, chuckling.</p><p>Juventude took a chance on him and in 2002 he was sold to Lille. Communication problems nearly caused a riot in the hotel restaurant. \"They asked whether the food was good but I thought they wanted to know whether I wanted more. When I said no, the chef came out to remonstrate with me and everyone got very upset.\"</p><p>He moved on to Charleroi in Belgium in 2006. A year later, he was picked up by Standard Liège. He played alongside fellow afro-aficionado Marouane Fellaini and missed a penalty in the Champions League qualification play-off against Liverpool in 2009.</p><p>That December, Gladbach came calling. Dante played very well for the Foals but few realised the full extent of this late developer's talent. When Bayern triggered his release clause of €4.7m after a tip-off from their Brazilian right-back Rafinha, the headline of a press agency introduced him as the Reds' new \"<em>Schnäppchen-Verteidiger</em>\", a bargain defender.</p><p>\"I was bought to challenge the players they already had,\" Dante says. But he always believed that he could be much more than a squad player. \"You won't regret this,\" he told Rummenigge the moment after signing his contract. They certainly have not.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\">Bayern Munich</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bundesligafootball\">Bundesliga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball\">European club football</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/raphaelhonigstein\">Raphael Honigstein</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
