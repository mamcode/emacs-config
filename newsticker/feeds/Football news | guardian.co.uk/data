Ferguson, who felt that his team had stood up like champions, suggested that the referee, Lee Probert, was not strong enough, but his West Ham counterpart, Sam Allardyce, also tore into the officials.</p><p>Television replays showed that Robin van Persie was in an offside position when Shinji Kagawa's 77th-minute shot hit both posts before breaking for the striker to score United's second equaliser of the evening. The assistant referee Harry Lennard did not flag. Allardyce said that West Ham had been robbed of a \"famous victory\" and in the row over Carroll's challenge on De Gea, he took issue with Ferguson.</p><p>\"It was a red card, there is no doubt about that,\" Ferguson said. \"The referee did see it but he didn't see it as a red card. We know how West Ham play, it's ball-in-the-air most of the time and you've got to defend those things. They are very, very aggressive as we've seen tonight. You hope there's a strong referee. I'm not so sure we got that tonight.</p><p>\"We had to stand up to a lot there but we kept going, our players, down twice, came back . They played like champions. They were magnificent in terms of determination and courage to play, so I was pleased with the result.\"</p><p>Allardyce was not. \"Can I get my anger out first?\" he said. \"This was a famous victory for us and when we play like that and score one of the best goals of the season [through Mohamed Diamé] ... the job of the assistant referee is to give the decision. Van Persie is two yards offside.</p><p>\"He has taken a famous victory from us. To draw this game by default is a bitter pill to swallow. We were outstanding. If my players make those mistakes, they get dropped, so should they. Our fans [should] go home with 41 points, knowing that we are safe. There is £60m, £70m, £80m riding on it.</p><p>\"This level of football has to be equalled by the level of the officials. [Lennard's] coaches have to coach him properly and coach him into getting better – that is why they are professional these days.\"</p><p>Carroll said that he had gone for the ball in the collision that left De Gea poleaxed. \"I was running straight in and I couldn't stop at that moment,\" he said. Allardyce backed him up, with a nod towards the stopping distances in the Highway Code.</p><p>\"As you'll know from your code, when you are travelling at 60mph, it takes 300 yards to stop,\" he said. \"When Andy is travelling at 15mph, he can't stop. I don't agree [with Ferguson]. It was a yellow at worst. You can't commit for a header and then suddenly stop. We're just bitterly disappointed with the result, although it's another precious point against the team who are going to be champions.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Chilean, who has coached at Real Madrid and enjoyed a successful spell with Villarreal, took Málaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League this term despite continuing financial problems at the Spanish club, before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/09/borussia-dortmund-malaga-champions-league\" title=\"\">they lost to Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p><p>The 59-year-old speaks good English and is renowned as a disciplinarian who has implemented a brand of attractive, attacking football. His contract with Málaga expires at the end of next season but includes a buy-out clause believed to be set at around £3.4m, though it remains to be seen whether he can be persuaded to swap Spain for Stamford Bridge.</p><p>Chelsea, who appointed Benítez on a seven-month contract to succeed Roberto Di Matteo, intend to make a formal offer to their preferred candidate only once it is clear whether they have qualified for the Champions League. They are sounding out potential managers, with Pellegrini high on their shortlist.</p><p>José Mourinho is another possibility and has made clear his desire to return to London if, as expected, he leaves Real Madrid in the summer. David Moyes, whose contract at Everton expires in June, and the Atlético Madrid coach, Diego Simeone, have also made an impression, while Gianfranco Zola's progress at Watford has been noted even if these remain early&nbsp;days in the Italian's managerial career.</p><p>Benítez's hopes of leaving Chelsea with Champions League football were boosted by a first away success in the league since mid-January, the recalled John Terry scoring twice to defeat Fulham and remind the interim manager of his qualities. Regardless, the former England captain is likely to return to the bench for Sunday's trip to Liverpool. \"The important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"Every player wants to play every game, but they have to realise they can't do that and be 100% in each game.</p><p>\"As for the Champions League, I said a long time ago that the race for the top four would go until the end for the season. It'll be like this and I don't think any of the clubs up there, including Everton, is out of it. Things can change with every game. We have to keep winning our games and keep going.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/malaga\">Málaga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/laligafootball\">La Liga</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They also remember precisely what they said. On 14 May 1995, a spring's afternoon at Upton Park and Andy Cole, confronted by Ludek Miklosko, has the last-gasp chance to win the Premier League title for United. \"Just lift it, Andy,\" they shouted. Or words to that effect. But Cole hits it low at Miklosko, who saves. United draw and Blackburn Rovers are the champions.</p><p>That was when title races were title races, when they went to the wire or, at the very least, made it into May. United's canter to their 20th championship has been a very different story, one that has been marked by a remarkable absence of stress. The demons of Upton Park will always gnaw away at Sir Alex Ferguson but when they threatened to reappear here, after West Ham United scored wonderful goals, United swatted them away. The truth was that even a defeat would hardly have mattered.</p><p>United have come to trade in extreme end-of-season luxuries. Their target now is not only to win but to do so in historic style and despite these dropped points, they could still better Chelsea's record 95 points from 2004-05. When they stand to be crowned is also on the agenda. It could be on Sunday week at Arsenal, which would be particularly sweet for Robin van Persie. United roll on, remorselessly.</p><p>West Ham have enjoyed their own sort of comfort this season. The script for newly promoted teams, particularly those that wriggle up via the play-offs, calls for frayed nerves and regular dips in and out of the relegation plunge pool. But West Ham, perhaps surprisingly for a club with a recent addiction to chaos, have remained above the relegation battle, barely once being mentioned as candidates to slip down.</p><p>Allardyce merits credit for overseeing the steadiness. Before the play-off final against Blackpool at the end of his first season in charge, there had been the genuine feeling among the West Ham support that he should be sacked if the team lost. But he got the job done and these days he has the fans' acceptance, at the very least, if not their outright love for his style.</p><p>If many of his players fit a particular profile, they are certainly united behind him. They talk glowingly of his attention to detail and it was evident in his set-up here, in a tactical duel that he would have relished against his hero Ferguson. He pushed Mohamed Diamé and Kevin Nolan high on to United's defensive midfielders, Phil Jones and Michael Carrick, and his team carried the fight. Allardyce has made West Ham competitive.</p><p>United expected an aerial bombardment and balls up to Andy Carroll were a feature of the West Ham strategy. The tall striker put it about with Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and, shudderingly so, David De Gea.</p><p>Ferguson jabbed his finger as he advanced his protest to the fourth official, Andre Marriner, after De Gea had been cleaned out by Carroll following a 45th-minute corner.</p><p>The home team's finesse, though, was apparent, whether in Carroll's early threaded shot that kissed the outside of the far post or the sight of Ricardo Vaz Te tricking outrageously out of a tight spot inside his own area. Their opening goal was not bad, when they broke from the edge of their box. There was the drive of Diamé; a stop-start move from Matt Jarvis to flummox Ferdinand; Carroll's aerial power and Vaz Te's anticipation. And the second, from Diamé's left-footed curler, was a peach.</p><p>Carroll's future is a pressing issue for West Ham and his all-action display provided further evidence as to why. His willingness to battle against the hardest centre-halfs not only endears him to supporters. His team-mates relish the out-ball to him and his hold-up work allows them to squeeze up the pitch. His loan from Liverpool expires at the end of the season and Allardyce has suggested that his wage demands, allied to financial fair play, could make it impossible to make the move permanent.</p><p>And what of Allardyce, who has still to sign his contract extension? The club maintain that there will be no problems, that it is merely a matter of time and yet it has dragged and Allardyce says that he has to be sure of his ability to compete in the summer transfer market before he commits. There has also been the notion that he has wanted to wait until West Ham have 40 points. That could happen here on Saturday against Wigan.</p><p>United's focus was formidable. It has sustained them this season and on each occasion that they fell behind their response bristled with conviction. Shinji Kagawa's balance to tee up Antonio Valencia's goal was beautiful and the second equaliser had been extensively trailed, even if Van Persie might have been marginally offside before he struck his 25th of the season. There was no dramatic finale for United. The job had been done.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It goes without saying that one club will drop points.</p><p>Ramsey, though, is focused on what Arsenal have to do and he says that if they can win at Fulham on Saturday, to end a key week with seven points from an available nine, they would be in a commanding position. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/13/arsenal-norwich-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Arsenal beat Norwich City at home last Saturday</a> and the draw against Everton extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to five matches.</p><p>\"It was important for us not to lose against Everton and we still have a lot of confidence,\" Ramsey said. \"We were quite nervous in the first half and our final ball let us down but, overall, we were quite solid. We're looking forward to the weekend. Tottenham and Chelsea still have to play each other. They still have tough games. The teams are still going to drop points so we're positive and confident that we can finish in the top four.</p><p>\"We always knew that this week was going to be a big week for us and hopefully now we can finish it off strongly and get a win at Fulham. That would put us in a really strong position.\"</p><p>Ramsey has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks and it is no coincidence that he is back to playing in central midfield. \"I'm delighted with the way I'm playing and how the team is playing,\" he said. \"It makes a big difference [being in central midfield]. That's my position and that's where I want to play.</p><p>\"At the beginning of the season, I was moving all over the pitch, playing left-wing, right-wing, right-back. I was asked to do a job in many positions, which I'm happy to do for the team. If the manager wants me to play there, I'm not going to say no to that. But I've got my place back in the middle and my performances have been showing what I'm capable of doing there.\"</p><p>The Football Association will take no action following the fracas between Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Everton's Kevin Mirallas on Tuesday. The pair clashed in the tunnel at half-time but the governing body is satisfied that it was nothing serious.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal\">Arsenal</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhytner\">David Hytner</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Wenger complained that the referee, Neil Swarbrick, had failed to dismiss Darron Gibson for a series of fouls in a fractious first half, and claimed the Merseysiders had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/arsenal-arsene-wenger-everton\" title=\"\">gone \"over the edge\" throughout</a> with their challenges in seeking to snuff out Arsenal's threat.</p><p>Asked if Everton had been particularly keen to unnerve their hosts, Baines said: \"It was not something that we'd spoken about. Wherever we go, the team we're up against know that they will be in for a game against us. The workrate the players put in is there to be seen. We are not a side people enjoy playing against at any level: we have a little bit about the team. We have workrate and ethic, and the togetherness and team spirit are inspirational at times.</p><p>\"Sometimes I look around and I can't believe what some people are doing, the effort they are putting in, people going above and beyond and playing with injuries. It is inspirational to see how hard they work. Mixed with the quality we have and show, we can't be an easy team to play against. This game was very bitty and scrappy in the first half, with both sides conceding fouls and giving the ball away, but I don't think they can have any complaints about the physical side of it. I don't think there was anything [over the top] in the whole game.\"</p><p>The draw left Everton four points from Arsenal and still chasing Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea for the last two Champions League places. \"We are definitely the outsiders,\" added the England defender. \"The other sides are teams who people would back to beat us to those positions, but we won't give up on it. We will keep trying to win games. We go to Sunderland and then have a home game [against Fulham], and if we can get six points from the next two games let's see what everyone else does. We can try and keep up the pressure, keep winning and keep ourselves in the mix. You never know. We might just nick it.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton\">Everton</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield\">Dominic Fifield</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I have lost count how many games I used to go with him on a Tuesday night against some team, [with Dad] pulling me to the side, leaving 10 minutes before the end, and saying we would never go back.\"</p><p>\"Then on the Saturday we would be there again. For him to see that [promotion party], and for his son to play a part in that, makes it even more special. It hit home to me a little bit as well. He said he will die a happy man.\"</p><p>With Cardiff joining Swansea in the Premier League – the first time Wales has had two top-flight clubs – <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/blog/2013/apr/17/cardiff-city-promotion-premier-league-swansea\" title=\"\">Bellamy predicted there will be wider benefits</a> for the capital city and the country as a whole. \"The knock-on effect it can have on the national team, for young players coming through, this makes it so much more special as well,\" he said. \"We've seen what it has done for Swansea, we have seen what it has done for the city and the money it has brought in as well. We are the capital city, we are Cardiff City. What it will do for us will be immense and the knock-on effect it will have for Welsh football will only be positive.\"</p><p>Bellamy hailed Malky Mackay's contribution as manager as \"immense\" and said that, combined with the backing of the club's Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan, Cardiff have the perfect platform to achieve further success. \"Malky has really pushed us forward with his professionalism. Financially this club is going to grow and with him at the helm it will allow us to do it in the right manner. Hopefully there will be no limit to what he can succeed.\"</p><p>Asked about Cardiff's chances in the Premier League, Bellamy said: \"It is going to be a completely different stage. Are we going to sign players? I don't know. I've got to look after myself as well, so I hope we don't sign too many players, especially on the left wing. I don't think we need players there! No, of course we do. We need strength in depth everywhere but that is between the manager and owner.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/craig-bellamy\">Craig Bellamy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chelsea have thrust their way back into the Premier League's top three, eclipsing Fulham at a canter with players whose days at the club appear to be numbered thriving in the familiarity of a derby. Those crammed into the Putney End will have found reassurance in the sight of Frank Lampard and, in particular, John Terry excelling. This was a throwback, a saunter to enjoy on the banks of the Thames.</p><p>Both the veterans had sat out Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City, a watershed given the significance of that occasion and the reality they have been permanent fixtures on the bigger stages when fit. The sheer weight of games has forced each into Rafael Benítez's policy of rotation though Lampard, his contract drifting to its conclusion, and Terry have started to feel more second-string than first-choice.</p><p>The 60th game of Chelsea's season offered a reminder of their qualities. When the team sought strength they rallied, albeit against opponents too wasteful to inflict their own wounds. A first away win in the league since mid-January was timely given the fixture clutter.</p><p>Lampard oozed calm authority on his 600th appearance for the club, even if he still seeks the two goals to equal Bobby Tambling's club record of 202. It was Terry who registered twice here, a header in either half puncturing Fulham's resistance, the captain ending the contest bare-chested and celebrating in front of the away support. \"I'm really pleased with his performance, but the most important thing is always the team,\" said Benítez. \"They all know that. The players have to be ready to perform and on their toes every game.\" With Gary Cahill close to a return from a knee injury, Terry's alternate selections may well be prolonged but, regardless, he can make his mark on the run-in.</p><p>Benítez had required his captain's strong-arm presence here. The reality is Chelsea had needed a spark to ignite what had initially been another understandably leggy display. Fulham had created the early opportunities, Dimitar Berbatov orchestrating their play, with the visitors limited to flurries of possession before David Luiz tired of all the pretty approach-play. He collected the ball some 30 yards out and with Bryan Ruiz too half-hearted in his attempt to close him down, lashed a shot which caught the wind gusting around the arena and careered beyond Mark Schwarzer into the top corner.</p><p>It was a staggering goal to pep the visitors' resolve. Half-time was close when Lampard belted a free-kick from distance and tapped into the same flight path, the ball swerving in mid-air and thudding into Schwarzer's chest before dribbling behind. Fulham never recovered their composure from the resultant corner, Juan Mata eventually floating a deep cross to the far post where Terry leapt unchallengedbetween Sascha Riether and Philippe Senderos to power a header into the net.</p><p>That lead was never likely to be properly challenged thereafter, Chelsea's composure established. For all Fulham's huff and puff, there was little surprise when the revitalised Fernando Torres flicked on a corner and Terry, from virtually on the goal-line, nodded in a second 19 minutes from time.</p><p>Fulham stewed in their frustration. They are not used to yielding to their local rivals so readily in this arena, with this a first defeat in four years, though the exasperation was born more of an inability to take their own chances. Martin Jol's side had forged the clearer opportunities when the game was goalless only to be blunted by profligacy.</p><p>The tone had been set in the opening attack Riether – a player Jol hopes to secure on a long-term basis from Cologne in the summer after an excellent season on loan – crossing beyond David Luiz only for Ruiz, alone in front of goal, to poke an awkward volley over the bar.

That was until the 83rd minute when Aleksandar Kolarov fed Carlos Tevez whose finish from 20 yards came as a right-foot bullet which the visiting goalkeeper, Joel Robles, found impossible to stop.</p><p>That signalled the end of this phase of Wigan Athletic's relegation-dodging escape act that had previously yielded seven points from three games. As Manchester United drew at Upton Park, Tevez's winner made it a productive night for City – Roberto Mancini having previously stated their mission is to confirm second place and reduce the deficit to United.</p><p>City are now 13 points behind with a game in hand. For Mancini, this prompted a joke about Robin van Persie's contested late equaliser at West Ham. \"If they didn't score an offside probably we were nine [points behind if they win their extra game],\" he said.</p><p>There was a more mixed message for the returning Micah Richards whose serious knee injury had kept him out since 27 October. \"I'm happy because he came back to play but I thought that he was in better form because he trained and because we know true Richards,\" Mancini said. \"For this reason I think that he needs to work a lot. He played for 10 minutes, after [that] he went down because it's normal after six months. It's impossible he can play well for 70 minutes.\"</p><p>Wigan are now three points adrift of Aston Villa, Stoke City and Sunderland though they have also played one fewer match. \"I see it going down to the final game, we are playing Aston Villa,\" Roberto Martínez said. \"We talk about six pointers and it does not get bigger than that. That is something we would be happy about from where we came from but we have a lot of games before that.\"</p><p>City's recent displays in beating United and knocking Chelsea out of the FA Cup to reach the final had been evidence of a late-season return to form. Here, they took a while to wake from a soporific opening until the scoreboard flashed up that United had gone 1-0 down.</p><p>Suddenly Yaya Touré could be spied marauding through the middle, then Richards surged into space down the right but had strayed offside.</p><p>Next up, Sergio Agüero, playing to the left of the City trident behind the lone striker Tevez, made life awkward for Emmerson Boyce and Paul Scharner and flipped over a cross that was unlucky not to be met by a team-mate.</p><p>City, though, had to bless their fortune as Wigan, in their most convincing passage of play, pinned them back and in front of Joe Hart's goal Kolarov had to be alert to make a skied clearance that could have gone anywhere.</p><p>Next Arouna Koné's touch failed him when he had only Hart to beat – and the keeper then had to throw out his arms and legs in a star jump to save from Franco Di Santo after some slick footwork created an opening. Moments later Richards was forced to upend the same player as Di Santo looked to split the defence and the right-back was booked. To the relief of the home fans Wigan's free-kick was hit over the wall by the impressive Shaun Maloney and straight into Hart's hands.</p><p>Agüero, who scored the clinching goal in the 2-1 win over Chelsea at Wembley, did not emerge for the second half and was replaced by Edin Dzeko in a City reshuffle that switched to a three-man defence. If Mancini was hoping this new formation would galvanise his team he had to watch when, with hart beaten, Joleon Lescott positioned himself superbly to clear off the line from Maloney.</p><p>Just before the hour the Italian changed his personnel again. Javi García came off for James Milner as his manager reverted to his original back four, with Samir Nasri switching to the left wing and the England amidfielder taking his place on the right.</p><p>Sensing someone should wrest the initiative, Tevez blazed wide with only Robles to beat. While there were further chances for each side but no goals until the striker's pivotal intervention.</p><p>Mancini, who rested Gaël Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta and Matija Nastasic, believes Wigan will survive. \"They don't deserve to be relegated,\" he said. \"For 60 minutes they played better than us.\"</p><p>He and Martínez had perhaps been correct to suggest that no implications could be drawn from the contest regarding the Cup final. But, if it is as entertaining as this one, 11 May should be an invigorating occasion.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiejackson\">Jamie Jackson</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sir Alex Ferguson's men twice had to come from behind but this is the resilience that is taking them to their 20th league championship and, in that context, they will not mind too much that their late, dramatic search for a winner could not concoct a decisive goal.</p><p>The damage is only superficial when a team have their advantage at the top of the league and, though the gap is trimmed to 13 points to Manchester City, everything still points to the game at Arsenal on Sunday week as the moment when they can confirm the handover. For Robin van Persie, the scorer of their 77th-minute equaliser, it must be a sweet prospect.</p><p>Van Persie had been offside for his goal and Sam Allardyce lamented at some length afterwards about the injustice his team has suffered. West Ham United took the lead in the 17th minute when Ricardo Vaz&nbsp;Tê finished a move that had begun on the edge of their own penalty area and the goal from Mohamed Diamé, 10 minutes into the second half, was one of the outstanding moments Upton Park has witnessed this season. In between, Antonio Valencia had scored his first goal of the season but the champions-elect had looked flat for long spells, with Wayne Rooney enduring a difficult and undistinguished night, and it was only after Van Persie's goal that West Ham suddenly looked vulnerable. Allardyce can complain too often about match officials but on this occasion he had a point.</p><p>The West Ham manager was not alone, though, in harbouring a few grievances, Ferguson arguing that Andy Carroll deserved an \"obvious red card\" for the flying leap into David de Gea that poleaxed the goalkeeper in the first half. Carroll had been a difficult opponent for the league leaders, particularly in the opening hour, when it was not just his size that the opposition defence found awkward to handle but his movement and ability to bring others into the game.</p><p>He was booked in the second half for a far more innocuous tussle with De Gea but the way the Spaniard handled the earlier battering was another reflection of United's durability this season. De Gea may not have suffered a more crashing challenge since arriving in England, even going back to those periods when opposition teams would routinely try to rough him up. Yet the Spaniard is no soft touch these days and it was telling how Ferguson's players did not feel it necessary to back him up when he gave a little back in the second half. De Gea can fight his own battles now.</p><p>Ferguson, however, was entitled to object and it was difficult afterwards to know which manager was the most annoyed. Both had legitimate grievances but Allardyce was right to say the lack of offside against Van Persie had the greater consequences. Kagawa's shot had flicked off James Collins and ricocheted off one post to the other. Van Persie turned in the loose ball, putting away a finish that was probably harder than he made it look, but it was an unmistakably bad call from the assistant referee. Allardyce described it as an \"easy&nbsp;decision\".</p><p>West Ham had to repel some concerted pressure for the remainder of the match, Ferguson's players passing the ball with greater speed and penetration. Yet the lingering memory will be what happened in the 55thminute after Vaz Tê and Guy&nbsp;Demel worked a little passing triangle with Diamé near the right-hand corner of the penalty area. The turn from Diamé to&nbsp;spin away from Rooney was wonderful in its own right. The curling left-foot shot, struck with equal measures of power and&nbsp;precision, made it a goal of sumptuous quality.</p><p>Vaz Tê's goal had not been too shabby either. This time, Rooney misplaced a pass on the edge of West Ham's penalty area. Diamé carried the ball forward then played it to the left for Matt Jarvis. Rio Ferdinand was turned far too easily and, when the cross was chipped up to the far post, Carroll had a clear height advantage over Patrice Evra. Vaz Tê had anticipated that Carroll's effort might come his way and applied the decisive touch with a stooping header. Rooney, unwittingly involved in both West Ham goals, looked forlorn when he was substituted and will remember the occasion with little fondness.</p><p>Ferguson's men had flickered only sporadically before an equaliser that was classy in its creation. Van Persie's pass sent Kagawa running through the inside-left channel. Winston Reid dived in too impulsively and Kagawa dropped his shoulder, turned to the byline then played the ball across the goalmouth to precisely where Valencia wanted it. From two yards, Valencia could hardly miss.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited\">West Ham United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danieltaylor\">Daniel Taylor</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The last train to Manchester from Euston is at 9pm and the final train to Wigan from the same station departs at 8.31pm.</p><p>On Wednesday night the FA released a statement declaring that 5.15pm is \"a regular kick-off time in the football calendar\" and insisted that the majority of fans would use official coaches, run by the competition sponsor National Express, to attend the match. However, supporters say the claim that a small proportion will be travelling by train to London is \"absolute rubbish\" and that the FA's attitude leaves a \"sour taste\".</p><p>Kevin Parker, secretary of the Manchester City Supporters Club, said: \"Not only does it show that they don't care but it shows that they don't know. From where they're coming from in their offices in Soho or their hotels, a 5.15pm kick-off is no problem. But the reality is that a number of fans will be travelling by train and wanted to catch a train home at a sensible time.</p><p>\"What's going to happen now is that people have booked tickets for a 9pm train, the last that City fans can catch, and some of them might not get to see the end of the game – God forbid if it goes to extra time. I don't see any reason at all why this game couldn't have kicked off earlier.</p><p>\"The coaches are going to be in demand because they are all coming from the north west of England. It's unbelievably bad planning. Fans will work round it because that's what they do, but it's not going to be easy, it's going to be financially more difficult. It leaves a sour taste, you always look for the opportunity for the FA to get something right these days and they don't.\"</p><p>Asked if the FA's claim that a small percentage of fans will be travelling by train was correct, Parker added: \"That's absolute rubbish. Most people I know wouldn't dream of driving to London and almost all are catching the train.\"</p><p>Wigan and City met in the Premier League on Wednesday night, hours after the FA released a statement that has compounded an already controversial situation.</p><p>\"The FA would like to highlight that 5.15pm is a regular kick-off time in the football calendar,\" it said. \"This time was agreed with major stakeholders and broadcasters and has been used across the game for a number of years for televised matches. In terms of transportation, a small percentage of Cup final fans use the method of train travel.\"</p><p>Jason Taylor, spokesman for the Wigan Athletic Supporters Club, said: \"The FA don't think about stuff like young children of four or six years old potentially not getting home till 2am if they are travelling by coach. These people aren't going to be getting home till very, very late.</p><p>\"We're in the FA Cup final and we'll do whatever we can do get down there – the FA know that they've got us cornered. There's not many people coming down on the train, because we can't.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa\">The FA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/wiganathletic\">Wigan Athletic</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united\">Manchester United</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa-cup\">FA Cup</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Aston Villa captain, who was diagnosed with the disease in March last year, has undergone intensive bouts of chemotherapy treatment and is now in remission.</p><p>\"It was a very, very long year but now, after all this treatment, I can go back to a normal life,\" said Petrov, who paid a visit to Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground this week. \"I have finished all of the high intensity treatment and from now on I'll be on the softer treatment, which is two years on tablets. I can start doing things that I couldn't do in the last year. I can take the kids to school, I can come here [to the training ground], I can start doing a bit of work and losing a little bit of weight.\"</p><p>Petrov said that he thought he was suffering from \"just a cold, nothing serious\" before he was diagnosed. \"While the treatment was going on I was surprised how long things were dragging on, it kept dragging and I kept thinking: 'When is this going to finish?' But with a lot of patience and a lot of support from family and friends and everybody I managed to pull through. I had my hard moments but I had good moments as well. I can say I'm lucky because some people with this disease will die very quickly and I managed to keep battling and still be here, still standing. It's really good, that's a great thing.\"</p><p>The 33-year-old paid tribute to the players and staff at Villa and in particular the supporters, who have applauded in the 19th minute of every match, in recognition of Petrov's squad number. \"I don't know how I can thank the fans because it's been incredible,\" the Bulgaria international said. \"Sometimes I have a joke with some friends when they text me saying: 'You've still got that applause in the 19th minute, when are they going to stop?!' But it's been incredible.</p><p>\"I've got a great wife, a strong, great wife and she's been unbelievable, incredible in this journey. The kids as well, my mum and dad, my brother, my wife's mum, they've all been so strong and close beside me. To have support every single day from people who have their own problems and their own life but they keep finding the time to send you a message or call you, it's just unbelievable.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa\">Aston Villa</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stuartjames\">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It had been mooted that the Football League would deem a deduction on an already relegated club to be no punishment at all, but it intends to implement the sanction during the current campaign once Portsmouth exit administration, which they expect to do this week.</p><p>\"We feel that although the punishment hasn't technically been activated yet, its effects have certainly been felt from day one of this season,\" said PST's Colin Farmery. \"We feel that we've served the punishment and that it has had an effect on our season, so the points ought to come off now.</p><p>\"We knew that they were going to come off – although we started the season on zero points, mentally everyone started on -10 points. If you are told that you will lose 10 points at some point during the season, you never budget for those points. If you look at it like that then we have been punished.</p><p>\"If we were to end up with a 10-point deduction next season it would feel like we are being punished twice for the same offence. We certainly feel that as a football club we can look in the eyes of a supporter from any other club and say we have been punished for the sins of others considerably over the last three years. We were in the Premier League and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/may/15/chelsea-portsmouth-fa-cup-final\" title=\"\">FA Cup final</a> – we've suffered three relegations and had 29 points taken off us.\"</p><p>Ashley Brown, the PST chairman, had previously said it would be \"devastating\" if the 10-point sanction was imposed next season, with Portsmouth's future now finally appearing stable despite a second successive relegation.</p><p>Pompey were playing in the Premier League three years ago and won the FA Cup in 2008, but have slid down the divisions due to catastrophic financial mismanagement by a number of owners. However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/10/portsmouth-future-fratton-park-ownership\" title=\"\">following an 11th-hour deal struck at the high court last week regarding the valuation of Fratton Park</a>, PST will&nbsp;become 51% shareholders under a new structure.</p><p>Once they exit administration Portsmouth are expected to appoint a new chief executive and confirm that the caretaker manager, Guy Whittingham, will take up the post on a full-time basis.</p><p>Farmery added: \"The really big challenge is about to begin and that's a really exciting. Everyone's been resigned to League Two football since January and the fact that we knew we were going to lose 10 points as well really put the tin lid on it. As a club we've played at this level in the past and while we feel we should be playing in a higher division because of our status, we're in the division we deserve to be in.</p><p>\"Once we come out of administration we can start functioning as a normal football club again. We've got a number of players on loans or short-term contracts and the ones that our new management team want to keep we should be able to provide the resources for.</p><p>\"We've been a pretty sick club for three or four years now but we've ended this season well and there is confidence that we can take into next year. We have a medium-to-long-term plan to get back into the Championship.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/leagueonefootball\">League One</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-finances\">Finances</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league\">Football League</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-riach\">James Riach</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cardiff City's long overdue promotion to the Premier League means that Welsh football, for the first time ever, will be home to two top-flight clubs next season, with Malky Mackay's side going toe-to-toe with Swansea City on the biggest stage.</p><p>How we would have laughed at that prospect a little while ago. Cardiff and Swansea have been through everything from winding up orders to administration, and for a snapshot of just how bleak their plight was in the not too distant past, the 1997-98 fourth-tier league table takes some beating. Five places off the bottom, in 88th position on the league ladder, were Swansea, just behind Darlington, Rochdale and Hartlepool. As for Cardiff, they were one rung lower, in 89th place. To give a guide as to the level of interest at that time, when the two clubs met at Ninian Park in 1997 the attendance was 6,459.</p><p>How times have changed. Decrepit old grounds have been replaced with all-seater stadiums that will be sold out almost without fail next season.</p><p>Swansea, who won the League Cup in February and remain on course for a top-10 finish in the Premier League, have already outgrown their new home and this week submitted plans to increase the capacity from 22,500 to 33,000, to cope with the increased demand.</p><p>For Cardiff, however, next season is all about survival rather than expansion. It promises to be quite a challenge, even allowing for the fact that they have been the team to catch in the Championship ever since the end of November and have a wealthy benefactor behind them. Vincent Tan, the club's Malaysian owner, has vowed to spend £25m in the Premier League, which is significantly more than Reading invested after winning the Championship last season but considerably less than Southampton, who secured the other automatic promotion berth, splurged in the summer.</p><p>For a blueprint for success in the Premier League, Tan believes Cardiff need to look no further than Swansea. \"I think it is a model that we should emulate,\" he said in February, when outlining his vision for Cardiff in the top flight. \"We should study more carefully and see how we can follow such a model. We can invest a bit more money than Swansea. They have managed to strategise well, so we would like to strategise well too.</p><p>\"But finally we would like to have some lucky breaks. We would like to buy, for example, someone along the Michu model. We would like to pay £2m and [the player] do very well for us, or pay £5m and do very well for us. But not pay £20m or £30m. We're not going to buy a Fernando Torres for £50m who doesn't score a goal for you. So we have got to be moderate, reasonable and hope for a good break.\"</p><p>Cardiff, in truth, have little in common with Swansea on and off the field.</p><p>In terms of the finances, Cardiff made a £13.6m loss in 2012 and have debts of £83m. Swansea, in contrast, reported a £15.9m profit for the six months up until the end of November 2012 and operate in the black. At Swansea there is supporter representation on the board. At Cardiff the fans have no say in the running of the club and were powerless to stop Tan from changing the kit colour from blue to red last summer.</p><p>When it comes to how things shape up on the pitch, Cardiff have more Premier League experience in their squad than Swansea did when they won promotion in 2011, although age is arguably against many of those players.</p><p>Tommy Smith will be 33 next month, Craig Bellamy turns 34 in July and Heidar Helguson, the club's top scorer with nine league goals, will be 36 in August. Fraizer Campbell, 25, has played in the top flight for three different clubs but he has scored only seven goals in 70 games at that level. Andrew Taylor, the former Middlesbrough left-back, is just about the only Cardiff player who is in his prime and has been a Premier League regular in the past.</p><p>Although Swansea lacked proven Premier League quality in their first season in the top flight, they had a way of playing – monopolising possession combined with a high intensity pressing game – that caused opponents plenty of problems and proved to be a major asset under the management of Brendan Rodgers, who also used the loan market well in that campaign. Cardiff, on the other hand, are much more functional; their success largely built on being solid defensively with a strong work ethic.</p><p>There is, of course, always the potential for unheralded players to blossom at the higher level, in the same way that Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Leon Britton and Joe Allen did for Swansea last season. Within the Cardiff ranks, David Marshall, whom Mackay rates as the best goalkeeper in the Championship, Mark Hudson, the captain, and the South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung, who has showed some nice touches in midfield, feel like the most likely candidates to catch the eye. We will also discover whether Peter Whittingham, who has been one of the most consistent performers in the Championship for several years, can make the step up.</p><p>Elsewhere, though, it feels as if Mackay has plenty of work to do to strengthen Cardiff's squad, despite what Tan said a couple of months ago, when he was asked whether the core of the team was strong enough to survive in the Premier League. \"I think it should be all right,\" he said. \"We also want to give the existing team the opportunity to play in the Premier League.

The owner, Vincent Tan, thought the club would thrive on the field and in the Asian market if they played in red and wore a dragon on their shirt. </em></p><p><em>Some fans were pragmatic enough to accept the changes. They have gone on to enjoy the uptake in the team's form that culminated in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/17/cardiff-celebrate-promotion-premier-league\">Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League on Tuesday night</a>. Other supporters, such as Scott Thomas, thought the bargain was not worth it. After 30 years of following the club, Thomas walked away from Cardiff City last summer. Here he explains his decision. </em></p><p>\"I don't watch Cardiff City games any more but, when I saw a picture of Craig Bellamy holding a red scarf emblazoned with dragons and the word 'Cardiff' rather than the club's proper name, it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. It confirmed that I made the right decision. I was surprisingly sanguine about the promotion. Cardiff City didn't go up last night; Cardiff City died last summer.</p><p>\"Seeing fans celebrate on the pitch during a news bulletin felt like watching the plug being pulled from a life-support machine that has been keeping an old relative alive. It was just another day at the office for club I no longer recognise. They are just another team now, not the one I supported for decades.</p><p>\"I never dreamed that Cardiff City would make it to the top flight and I wouldn't be there to see it. But the club I supported disappeared when a Malaysian businessman with no previous links to the city and no interest in its football took over Cardiff City and made it literally unrecognisable. The club I followed had history and traditions that went back 100 years, but now its future is subject to the whims of a single man.</p><p>\"I began supporting the club when my uncle and cousin took me to a match against Sheffield Wednesday in the 1975-76 season. I followed them to over 60 grounds in the fourth, third and second tiers with 25 friends I picked up over the years. I'm proud to say only a few of those guys renewed their season tickets for this season and some of them will not be renewing for next year.</p><p>\"It was big decision to walk away. Every fan has their own tipping point, but I knew immediately that I couldn't support a franchise. I wouldn't support a business like Tesco or Sainsbury's, and that's what Cardiff City have become. The club is no longer a community asset; it's just a football team that happens to play in the city. Cardiff City are one step away from MK Dons.</p><p>\"Many supporters stayed and many more will join now – people love a bandwagon – but a lot of the old-timers go less regularly and with less passion. More would have left, but a perfect storm of circumstances whipped fans into a demented reaction. They were desperate for success after so many near-misses and couldn't bear to see Swansea City do so well up the road.</p><p>\"I hate to admit it – old habits die hard – but Swansea City are a model club in many ways. Fan ownership has to be the way forward, but the Football Association aren't going protect the historical identity of clubs. The FA are just a booking agent for Wembley Stadium these days, as shown by the announcement of a 5.15pm kick-off time for this year's Cup final.</p><p>\"Even the national team are inferior to Premier League clubs now. Owners with money – or the promise of money – can do as they please. The FA didn't prevent Newcastle from rebranding their stadium and they didn't save Wimbledon, so they weren't going to save Cardiff City. We have listed buildings in this country, but football clubs are a free for all.</p><p>\"I could never support another club, but I've enjoyed watching other teams and other sports. I went to Wales's game in Scotland at Hampden last month, then to the Six Nations at Murrayfield and then to see Rangers play a few days later. Going to the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as rugby and boxing has been refreshing. On balance, it's better to be away from the venal, soul-destroying situation at Cardiff City.\"</p><p><em>Scott Thomas was speaking to Paul Campbell</em></p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/cardiffcity\">Cardiff City</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championship\">Championship</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Twelve teams started into the first season on September 8 1888, which would produce Preston North End as their very first champions.</p><p>We've crunched the numbers of all 113 top flight seasons (1888-1892: Football League, 1892-1992: First Division, 1992-today: Premier League). Eleven seasons had been suspended during the first and second world wars.</p><p>Since the foundation of the Football League, a total of 64 teams have played at least one season in the respective top flight of English football. Everton, one of the twelve founding members, is currently playing its 110th season in the top league, having missed only four for two spells in the second division. It is topping the list of most seasons played in the top flight.</p><p>23 teams have been crowned champions at least once, Manchester United (19 titles), Liverpool (18) and Arsenal (13) being the most successful collectors of silverware. </p><p>If we combine the two metrics – championships won and seasons played in the top league – we can calculate an efficiency index in winning tropies when in the race. Which puts Huddersfield Town right in the top group along the above serial winners.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>From a geographical perspective, London might have been and still be the city with by far the most teams, but its the North-Western cities that picked up most of the trophies to date. Our map shows how the 113 championship trophies have been spread across the country.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Over all 113 completed seasons, the average number of goals scored is just above three per game. It has been the highest in the very beginning, at 4.63 in the second season. After being at a steady low for the past fourty years, average goals scored per game have been rising again in the past three seasons. They are now – at a current 2.83 goals per game – on course to finish higher than in any other season since 1967-68.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Finally, if we count every single game played in England's top league since it was founded towards one table, this is what it would look like as of April 14 2013. Points are counted as they were awarded at the time, so two points for a win until 1981, three afterwards (did you know that the initial idea of the founders was to award points for wins only, so that it would make no difference if you drew or lost a game?).</p><p>What can you do with this data?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/davidbauer.ch/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au5EaQXOeZRGdHZDalp4elMyUEgybDhmeGJDOWFwSHc#gid=0\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a><br />• SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.myfootballfacts.com/All-TimeTopFlightPointsTable1888-89to2010-11.html\">Myfootballfacts.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/about/history.html 15:56\">Premier League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/PastWinnersDetail/0,,10794~475363,00.html \">Football League</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1888-89.html\">Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation</a></p><h2>NEW!

Under the steady hand of Malky Mackay, the Red Dragons (nee: Bluebirds) secured the point they needed against Charlton Athletic last night, prompting the kind of raucous carousing and celebrating last witnessed in the Welsh capital on the night of Charlotte Church's 21st birthday party.</p><p></p><p>The reaction to the Komodos' success has been mixed, with some supporters of other clubs appearing quite sniffy about the notion that in a romantic age when most successful British football clubs are owned by benevolent local mill owners eager to provide cheap entertainment for grateful workers to enjoy in their downtime, Cardiff have somehow 'cheated' by pumping millions into their club and changing the colour of their shirts in a bid to 'buy' success. The fact of the matter is, however, that like their Cardiff counterparts, most of these fans would happily wear pink replica shirts with a dancing cartoon Malayan tiger above a bowl of Nasi Goreng on the crest if they thought it would increase their club's chances of mixing it with the big boys and winning a trophy.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm very proud of the football club, the people of this club have had a lot of disappointment,\" said Mackay, who may well face disappointment of his own if chairman Vincent Tan decides further rebranding is required around the training ground. \"They have been through some tough times. The people of Cardiff have waited a long time to be back in the top division and they've never been in the Premier League. They've backed me and they've backed this football team and for that I will be forever grateful.\"</p><p></p><p>Among the locals celebrating on the pitch at the final whistle last night was a heavily tattooed young ruffian named Craig Bellamy, who signed permanently for his home-town club last August after leaving Liverpool for personal reasons. \"This is where we're from; we wear our heart on my sleeve,\" said Bellers, rather confusingly, who also famously wears an indelible depiction of the 1402 Battle of Pilleth, won by Owain Glyndwr, on his sleeve. \"I feel so privileged to have done it here, where the people I love most are nearby. I spoke to my father after the game, and he told me that he would now die a happy man.\"</p><p></p><p>With the Premier League fixtures to be announced on Wednesday 19 June, all eyes will now turn to Cardiff's two matches with Welsh rivals Swansea City, mouthwatering fixtures for which both clubs may well rebrand their club crests to incorporate cartoon dust-clouds with assorted fists, boots and 'oof!' noises emerging from them.

I did not go out to attack a horse. I love animals – I've got three dogs, a fish pond out the back and I feed foxes across the road. For some reason people are more upset about the fact that I hit a horse than a policewoman getting hurt. But I would like to apologise to the horse, to all the mounted section, to people of the north-east\" – Newcastle fan and animal-lover Barry Rogerson says sorry for swinging a haymaker at a police horse during the violence that erupted after Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. Rogerson went on to say he was wearing a scarf around his face at the time because it was \"cold\".</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"I note with some curiosity the almost complete lack of reaction to the FA's decision not to punish Sergio Agüero retrospectively for what appeared to be a concerted attempt to emasculate David Luiz from an unusual angle on Sunday. Oliver Holt tweeted at the time that 'there may have been a case for a straight red', presumably he meant with two-footed studs-up lunges at other players' upper thighs being such a disciplinary grey area. When compared to the universal outrage and debates about 'that type of player' that followed Callum McManaman's recent trangression being unpunished, the difference was stark. On the one hand it may be a positive sign that the English sporting press is finally progressing past the xenophobia that among other things has routinely seen foreign players roundly criticised for diving, while Tabloid Wayne and particularly $tevie Mbe's regular tangles with the invisible man go unremarked. On the other, it could just be the usual witless inconsistency of journalism born of populism writ large. Yeah, it's the other, isn't it\" – Jason Tew.</p><p></p><p>\"So … the FA suits continue to slavishly appease their television paymasters by shunting the FA Cup final forward two and a quarter hours to 5.15pm (yesterday's Quote of the Day). While it is no surprise that they show scant disregard for the travelling faithful from England's north-west, what about us poor Poms over here in Australia? The traditional midnight kick-off (Australian time) for this showpiece event was never ideal, but at least 'do-able'. Now the fan who is not in possession of a video recorder is faced with three choices: 1) go to bed super-early on Saturday night and set the alarm to be up super-early on Sunday morning; 2) go to bed super-late on Sunday morning and sleep in till late Sunday afternoon; or 3) sleep at a normal civilised hour and have a 'Likely Lads' day on Sunday, avoiding all contact with the outside world until such time as a televised re-run can be watched ostensibly live. Hang on … I've just thought of a fourth, even better, option: don't bother at all\" – Allastair McGillivray.</p><p></p><p>\"David McKee (yesterday's Fiver letters) cites 'double editions being sent, poor journalism, inaccurate score predictions and lack of humour' as 'recent incompetence' from the Fiver.

As I was in Florida, my experience of that incident was via that combustible mix of absurdity, bleakly cynical wit and outrage that ripples out in the form of Twitter fragments, whether in the aftermath of that crowd trouble in Newcastle, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/14/millwall-fa-wembley-wigan\">Milwall fans fighting among themselves at Wembley</a>, or, closer to home, the FC Dallas player George John being struck by a bottle thrown from <em>his own supporter's section</em>, after scoring an 88th minute winning goal against Los Angeles Galaxy — all incidents that occurred this weekend and that collectively gave the two days a surreally ugly quality. They're moments where disgust at the actual violence involved is mixed with a head-shaking disbelief at apparently grown adults who appear unable to grasp the fundamentally symbolic nature of sport, even when they're just there to watch. </p><p>In the George John case, for better or worse, the action seemed to be an isolated incident rather than a representation of typical behavior from a supporters group, or part of a pattern of crowd disturbances. That said, quite rightly the incident is being taken seriously by the club and MLS, and <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\">with reports of an attack on a Portland Timbers fan by San Jose supporters</a> this weekend, MLS reputation as a generally family friendly league is under scrutiny.</p><p><em></em></p><p>To take the John incident first, the player headed in the goal then appeared to many in the crowd to collide with the post and lie on the ground clutching the back of his head. The Dallas bench were initially unclear what had happened, and even the player didn't know what had struck him at first. When I spoke to the NBC team who were covering the game, Kyle Martino, who covers the games from between the team benches, confirmed that it was only when he started getting feedback over his headphones from the outside broadcast truck, about the replays showing the hurled bottle, that Dallas FC staff were alerted and began looking for the perpetrator. John, who'd come into the game as a doubt after receiving a concussion a week earlier, completed the game and actually joked with the broadcast team in interviews afterwards that next time the fans should drink the beer and not throw it, before leaving the scene for treatment on a nasty gash. </p><p>At time of writing neither MLS or FC Dallas owners had reached a decision on further action, though the two were in dialogue on Tuesday and an announcement was expected by Wednesday to indicate what action would follow from the club owners in the wake of the incident. In the meantime the club issued this short statement:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It is always unacceptable to throw anything onto the field of play because it endangers the safety of all players and personnel. In this specific incident, we have identified the individual and we are proceeding according to protocol with FC Dallas Stadium security, Frisco Police and Major League Soccer.</p></blockquote><p>To be clear, all of the Dallas Supporters group reps I spoke to, including our regular Guardian commenter Gina Zippilli, were genuinely mortified by the incident. The section of the ground the bottle was thrown from is a supporter group section, though admission to the section is not controlled by the supporter groups, and the particular individual involved is not believed to have been affiliated to any supporter group. Zippilli described a process of going through their member list and comparing photographs to NBC footage to try and identify the perpetrator, and talked about the \"idiot who turned a win into what felt like a loss, for how it would reflect on us.\" Zippilli is a member of the Inferno supporters group, some of whom were seated in the area, along with members of the Dallas Beer Guardians (a pun on the over-21 Beer Garden section of the stadium where the bottle was thrown from). </p><p>There have been sporadic similar incidents in the past in MLS: Sporting KC goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZjQhjmEP3c\">Jimmy Nielsen was struck by a bobblehead doll</a> during a game against Portland Timbers in 2011, and Houston Dynamo fans were punished by MLS for throwing objects during the MLS cup final in the same year. Each incident brings up questions about MLS supporter culture — which at its best melds elements of the constant singing of South American fans, the wit and chants of British fans, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jun/28/portland-timbers-seattle-sounders-tifo-display\">the conspicuous displays of the<em> tifosi</em></a> in an entertaining American hybrid. Lurking behind all of this appropriation and reinvention of course (and an ever present balancing act for MLS, clubs and even the formal supporter groups themselves) is the fear that certain fans might appropriate or imitate other less desirable cultural forms such as hooliganism, as misplaced marks of an authentic supporter culture. </p><p>For this reason, potentially as disturbing as the John incident, and perhaps more so (given the collective nature of it), were<a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/Timbers-fan-says-he-was-attacked-by-mob-of-San-Jose-fans-203023951.html\"> the reports that a Portland fan was set upon by a group of San Jose fans the next evening</a>. If true, that represents a rather more worrying development — sections of the San Jose support enjoy a somewhat mixed reputation among their peers as it is, and there have been previous incidents with rival LA groups when the two have met, but any suggestion that that behavior was bleeding into city centers at any scale will do little for the reputation of the league. </p><p>Somewhat encouragingly, the organized San Jose supporter groups such as the 1906 Ultras have been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1906Ultras?fref=ts\">quick to distance themselves from the perpetrators</a> and have suggested that if it transpires that any of their members were implicated, they will be expelled and the victims compensated. But in a week where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/16/nbc-premier-league-match-of-the-day\">NBC announced blanket coverage of the Premier League</a>, and in the wake of ESPN's expanded English language coverage of the Mexican league, it was disheartening to see any part of MLS participate in any form in the darker side of the culture of the sport, as it continues its slow, but seemingly inexorable globalizing push into the wider US consciousness.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls\">MLS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">US sports</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fcdallas\">FC Dallas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/san-jose-earthquakes\">San Jose Earthquakes</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/graham-parker\">Graham Parker</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It wasn't nominated for anything, per se, even though there was a category for The Least Funny Tea-time Email, and it wasn't invited, per se, but it still went to one. Admittedly it had to wear a cunning disguise – no one recognises the Fiver in a suit, unless it's in court – to sneak past the heavies on the door and it was later chucked out after staging a one-man protest when the gongs were being handed out, but still, what a night 8 November 1997 was! With that in mind, the Fiver understands all too well how Gareth Bale, Michael Carrick, Eden Hazard, Juan Mata, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie are feeling after they were named on the PFA's shortlist for Player of the Year. Panicked. They've got to get new suits, practise their acceptance speech, unless they're Michael Carrick, and practise their rictus grin/grudging applause combo if they lose, especially if they're Michael Carrick.</p><p></p><p>That's harsh on Carrick, isn't it? He's been excellent. He's not going to win, and nor are Eden Hazard and Juan Mata. It's between Gareth Bale, the star of Gareth Bale and The Hotspurs, Robin van Persie and Luis Suárez. Suárez? Boo! Hiss! However unlike Sports Personality of the Year, the PFA doesn't dish this one out based on who has the best personality, which would see Mata win. It's who's had the best season and, after careful consideration which consisted of closing its eyes and picking a name out of a hat, The Fiver has decided to give Suárez its imaginary vote and Liverpool's manager, Brentan Rodgers, is backing his player too. \"There isn't a club in the country who wouldn't want Suárez in their team. He'd be the favourite for me,\" said Rodgers, somehow resisting the urge to say \"myself\" instead of \"me\".</p><p></p><p>Some have claimed that Suárez's past misdemeanours mean that the quality of his football shouldn't be recognised, which is clearly total pish, and he has been defended by the PFA's head honcho Gordon Taylor. \"Sometimes controversy travels with players,\" said Taylor. \"Sometimes it is in their very nature. Sometimes it is that very intensity that causes a problem also makes sure they win.\" Admittedly that doesn't quite excuse the diving and the eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 but can't we all just get along? This isn't meant to be a popularity contest, although it should be pointed out that Suárez's intensity has only allowed Liverpool to win 13 of their 33 league matches. And when you put it like that, it's a disgrace that nice, useless Fernando Torres hasn't been nominated.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"He said we should go on holiday, making a gesture with his hand\" – Jorge Pellicier, manager of the Chilean champions Huachipato, is irked by the hitherto little-known go-on-holiday hand gesture of Grêmio head coach Verderlei Luxemburgo after the sides' Copa Libertadores fixture <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2013/apr/19/copa-libertadores-brawl-gremio-huachipato-video\" title=\"\">ended in this right old ruckus</a>.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"I would like to add a second tier of pedantry to Jamie Milne's letter on a suitable Cardiff mascot today (yesterday's Letters).

An ideal mascot for crowd 'banter'\" – James Marsden.</p><p></p><p>\"All the chat about Indonesia and Malaysia in the first two pedantgrams (yesterday's Letters) made me read 'gargantuan error' as 'orangutan error' and assume you'd managed to hire some higher-calibre recruits to the Fiver's writing team to join your infinite number of monkeys. I was disappointed when I realised my mistake, but thought I'd pass it on anyway in case you're looking for tips when you're next hiring\" – Jon Gerrard.</p><p></p><p>\"As I was sat reading yesterday's Fiver over a large plate of nasi goreng in Kuala Lumpur I came across a letter from a Rob Jordan claiming that said dish was Indonesian! Bahasa is spoken in both Malaysia and Indonesia (albeit with differences) but without doubt nasi goreng (meaning fried rice) is Malaysian.

It wasn't nominated for anything, per se, even though there was a category for The Least Funny Tea-time Email, and it wasn't invited, per se, but it still went to one. Admittedly it had to wear a cunning disguise – no one recognises the Fiver in a suit, unless it's in court – to sneak past the heavies on the door and it was later chucked out after staging a one-man protest when the gongs were being handed out, but still, what a night 8 November 1997 was! With that in mind, the Fiver understands all too well how Gareth Bale, Michael Carrick, Eden Hazard, Juan Mata, Luis Suárez and Robin van Persie are feeling after they were named on the PFA's shortlist for Player of the Year. Panicked. They've got to get new suits, practise their acceptance speech, unless they're Michael Carrick, and practise their rictus grin/grudging applause combo if they lose, especially if they're Michael Carrick.</p><p></p><p>That's harsh on Carrick, isn't it? He's been excellent. He's not going to win, and nor are Eden Hazard and Juan Mata. It's between Gareth Bale, the star of Gareth Bale and The Hotspurs, Robin van Persie and Luis Suárez. Suárez? Boo! Hiss! However unlike Sports Personality of the Year, the PFA doesn't dish this one out based on who has the best personality, which would see Mata win. It's who's had the best season and, after careful consideration which consisted of closing its eyes and picking a name out of a hat, The Fiver has decided to give Suárez its imaginary vote and Liverpool's manager, Brentan Rodgers, is backing his player too. \"There isn't a club in the country who wouldn't want Suárez in their team. He'd be the favourite for me,\" said Rodgers, somehow resisting the urge to say \"myself\" instead of \"me\".</p><p></p><p>Some have claimed that Suárez's past misdemeanours mean that the quality of his football shouldn't be recognised, which is clearly total pish, and he has been defended by the PFA's head honcho Gordon Taylor. \"Sometimes controversy travels with players,\" said Taylor. \"Sometimes it is in their very nature. Sometimes it is that very intensity that causes a problem also makes sure they win.\" Admittedly that doesn't quite excuse the diving and the eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 but can't we all just get along? This isn't meant to be a popularity contest, although it should be pointed out that Suárez's intensity has only allowed Liverpool to win 13 of their 33 league matches. And when you put it like that, it's a disgrace that nice, useless Fernando Torres hasn't been nominated.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"He said we should go on holiday, making a gesture with his hand\" – Jorge Pellicier, manager of the Chilean champions Huachipato, is irked by the hitherto little-known go-on-holiday hand gesture of Grêmio head coach Verderlei Luxemburgo after the sides' Copa Libertadores fixture <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2013/apr/19/copa-libertadores-brawl-gremio-huachipato-video\" title=\"\">ended in this right old ruckus</a>.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"I would like to add a second tier of pedantry to Jamie Milne's letter on a suitable Cardiff mascot today (yesterday's Letters). We don't have native bluebirds (native to the Americas) in the UK, rather blue tits. An ideal mascot for crowd 'banter'\" – James Marsden.</p><p></p><p>\"All the chat about Indonesia and Malaysia in the first two pedantgrams (yesterday's Letters) made me read 'gargantuan error' as 'orangutan error' and assume you'd managed to hire some higher-calibre recruits to the Fiver's writing team to join your infinite number of monkeys. I was disappointed when I realised my mistake, but thought I'd pass it on anyway in case you're looking for tips when you're next hiring\" – Jon Gerrard.</p><p></p><p>\"As I was sat reading yesterday's Fiver over a large plate of nasi goreng in Kuala Lumpur I came across a letter from a Rob Jordan claiming that said dish was Indonesian! Bahasa is spoken in both Malaysia and Indonesia (albeit with differences) but without doubt nasi goreng (meaning fried rice) is Malaysian. Just like Cardiff\" – Chris Prior.</p><p></p><p>\"It was good to see Barry Rogerson go with the tried and tested 'some of my best friends are animals' defence. (Wednesday's Quote Of The Day).

And to be fair to him, he probably does have a bespoke Highway Code to go along with his equatorial waistline, gravitational pull, turning circle of an ocean liner etc. and the like\" – Steven Dunne.</p><p></p><p>\"So I suppose PSG's loss to Evian in the French Cup pours cold water on the idea that they are a team capable of winning major honours?\" – Seamus Scanlon.</p><p></p><p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">the.boss@guardian.co.uk</a>.

Dante's team had just won the Bundesliga title with six games to spare but celebrations were disappointingly muted. With the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus three days away, the club had decided this was not the time for festivities. Ritual Bavarian \"beer showers\" and the donning of naff T-shirts were ruled out. However, Dante, a first‑time winner of the German league, could not help&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The 29-year-old broke ranks to climb up a fence in front of the Bayern block, swapped his shirt for a plastic version of the <em>Meisterschale</em> (the championship bowl) with one fan, then ran back on to the pitch waving his bounty around with a touching, child-like euphoria. \"The club want to put this thing in the museum but at the moment it's in my house,\" he says.</p><p>That bit of unfiltered joy cemented his status as the Munich supporters' new cult hero, and it has also become the defining image of Bayern's campaign thus far. It might have been the wrong trophy (Bayern will be handed the genuine article after their home game against Augsburg on 11 May) but it was certainly the right player. Dante, a defender of quiet, unassuming elegance and unshakeable calmness, has become the unlikely figurehead for a team on the brink of a historic treble. To be sure, fellow Bayern new boys Javier Martínez, the €40m midfielder from Athletic Bilbao, and the tireless striker Mario Mandzukic (€13m from Wolfsburg) have also added fine layers of quality that last year's beaten finalists might have been missing, but it is Dante's dependability, athleticism and passing that have taken Jupp Heynckes's side that extra step further. His skill set&nbsp;has enabled them to add some high, opponent-unnerving pressing to their game.</p><p>Next stop: the first leg in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona on Tuesday and for Dante the task of keeping Lionel Messi quiet. \"He can do amazing things, he is the best player in the world,\" he says, matter-of-factly. The lack of any discernible sense of excitement is perhaps due to his strong belief that this season Bayern really do not have to fear anyone. \"Barcelona have a great team, the greatest show on earth. But we are at our best at this moment in time, and we certainly won't change our game for them. We don't change for anyone.\" He adds that Barcelona's recent performances in the away games to Milan (a 2-0 defeat) and Paris Saint-Germain (2-2) have shown \"that they concede goals\".</p><p>So do Bayern, at least in Europe – 10 in 10 games. But in the league their figures look impossibly good. A mere \"13\" in the \"against\" column after 29 games tells of a superiority that has at times unsettled even themselves. \"Our training sessions are often more intense than the matches,\" Dante admitted recently, but he is quick to channel praise away from himself and towards the team's collective endeavour. \"We play as a unit, we're incredibly compact,\" he says. \"When you get so much protection from midfield it's actually easy to play as defender.\"</p><p>He recalls his previous stint at Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he would find himself \"maybe four or five times\" one-on-one with a striker. \"At Bayern, it might happen once in the game.\" He singles out French winger Franck Ribéry (\"he's a super funny guy with a great sense of humour, but on the pitch he always fights, he wants to win, win, win\") and Bastian Schweinsteiger, the team's midfield linchpin. \"He's the maestro, he controls the tempo and flow of the whole ensemble.\"</p><p>But Bayern's strong squad and Heynckes's tactical tweaks are not the only important factors. Dante, who arrived at the club a few days after the traumatic defeat at the hands of Chelsea in their own ground in the Champions League final last May, feels that his team-mates have been spurred on by the disappointment. \"Everything that has happened has made the team stronger,\" he says.</p><p>The club hierarchy had feared the opposite might happen. They installed the almost comically dour martinet Matthias Sammer as a sporting director to prevent a lame-duck scenario. At 67, Heynckes, soon to be replaced by Pep Guardiola, was always likely to retire in the summer. What they did not anticipate was just how well Heynckes would handle the dressing room in light of his rotation policy. Dante can take some credit for the great mood in the camp, as well. His professional but relaxed attitude has rubbed off on everyone, to the point that he is now seen as one of the team's indispensable leaders. \"I've never seen such a positive player,\" says the club's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"He drives into training with a smile and he leaves with a smile.\" Local media have started to referring to him as the <em>Abwehrchef</em>, the boss at the back. \"He's been a bullseye addition,\" says Heynckes.</p><p>At home they have woken up to his talents, too. Dante won his first call-up for the 2-1 friendly defeat by England in February, after which Luiz Felipe Scolari called him \"a defender for the future of the <em>Selecão</em>\". Recognition has taken its time. As a youngster Dante Bonfim Costa Santos failed to impress at a series of trials with clubs in Brazil's north-east. His father, an art restorer (\"he named me after the poet\") urged him to give up on his dream as they could no longer support him financially. The 17-year-old sold his video console to pay for the bus fare from his native Salvador to try his luck at Juventude in the south of the country. \"He was surprised when I called him from there, asking him to send me money for clothes because it was so cold,\" he says, chuckling.</p><p>Juventude took a chance on him and in 2002 he was sold to Lille. Communication problems nearly caused a riot in the hotel restaurant. \"They asked whether the food was good but I thought they wanted to know whether I wanted more. When I said no, the chef came out to remonstrate with me and everyone got very upset.\"</p><p>He moved on to Charleroi in Belgium in 2006. A year later, he was picked up by Standard Liège. He played alongside fellow afro-aficionado Marouane Fellaini and missed a penalty in the Champions League qualification play-off against Liverpool in 2009.</p><p>That December, Gladbach came calling. Dante played very well for the Foals but few realised the full extent of this late developer's talent. When Bayern triggered his release clause of €4.7m after a tip-off from their Brazilian right-back Rafinha, the headline of a press agency introduced him as the Reds' new \"<em>Schnäppchen-Verteidiger</em>\", a bargain defender.</p><p>\"I was bought to challenge the players they already had,\" Dante says. But he always believed that he could be much more than a squad player. \"You won't regret this,\" he told Rummenigge the moment after signing his contract. They certainly have not.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\">Bayern Munich</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bundesligafootball\">Bundesliga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball\">European club football</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/raphaelhonigstein\">Raphael Honigstein</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But we are at our best at this moment in time, and we certainly won't change our game for them. We don't change for anyone.\" He adds that Barcelona's recent performances in the away games to Milan (a 2-0 defeat) and Paris Saint-Germain (2-2) have shown \"that they concede goals\".</p><p>So do Bayern, at least in Europe – 10 in 10 games. But in the league their figures look impossibly good. A mere \"13\" in the \"against\" column after 29 games tells of a superiority that has at times unsettled even themselves. \"Our training sessions are often more intense than the matches,\" Dante admitted recently, but he is quick to channel praise away from himself and towards the team's collective endeavour. \"We play as a unit, we're incredibly compact,\" he says. \"When you get so much protection from midfield it's actually easy to play as defender.\"</p><p>He recalls his previous stint at Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he would find himself \"maybe four or five times\" one-on-one with a striker. \"At Bayern, it might happen once in the game.\" He singles out French winger Franck Ribéry (\"he's a super funny guy with a great sense of humour, but on the pitch he always fights, he wants to win, win, win\") and Bastian Schweinsteiger, the team's midfield linchpin. \"He's the maestro, he controls the tempo and flow of the whole ensemble.\"</p><p>But Bayern's strong squad and Heynckes's tactical tweaks are not the only important factors. Dante, who arrived at the club a few days after the traumatic defeat at the hands of Chelsea in their own ground in the Champions League final last May, feels that his team-mates have been spurred on by the disappointment. \"Everything that has happened has made the team stronger,\" he says.</p><p>The club hierarchy had feared the opposite might happen. They installed the almost comically dour martinet Matthias Sammer as a sporting director to prevent a lame-duck scenario. At 67, Heynckes, soon to be replaced by Pep Guardiola, was always likely to retire in the summer. What they did not anticipate was just how well Heynckes would handle the dressing room in light of his rotation policy. Dante can take some credit for the great mood in the camp, as well. His professional but relaxed attitude has rubbed off on everyone, to the point that he is now seen as one of the team's indispensable leaders. \"I've never seen such a positive player,\" says the club's CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"He drives into training with a smile and he leaves with a smile.\" Local media have started to referring to him as the <em>Abwehrchef</em>, the boss at the back. \"He's been a bullseye addition,\" says Heynckes.</p><p>At home they have woken up to his talents, too. Dante won his first call-up for the 2-1 friendly defeat by England in February, after which Luiz Felipe Scolari called him \"a defender for the future of the <em>Selecão</em>\". Recognition has taken its time. As a youngster Dante Bonfim Costa Santos failed to impress at a series of trials with clubs in Brazil's north-east. His father, an art restorer (\"he named me after the poet\") urged him to give up on his dream as they could no longer support him financially. The 17-year-old sold his video console to pay for the bus fare from his native Salvador to try his luck at Juventude in the south of the country. \"He was surprised when I called him from there, asking him to send me money for clothes because it was so cold,\" he says, chuckling.</p><p>Juventude took a chance on him and in 2002 he was sold to Lille. Communication problems nearly caused a riot in the hotel restaurant. \"They asked whether the food was good but I thought they wanted to know whether I wanted more. When I said no, the chef came out to remonstrate with me and everyone got very upset.\"</p><p>He moved on to Charleroi in Belgium in 2006. A year later, he was picked up by Standard Liège. He played alongside fellow afro-aficionado Marouane Fellaini and missed a penalty in the Champions League qualification play-off against Liverpool in 2009.</p><p>That December, Gladbach came calling. Dante played very well for the Foals but few realised the full extent of this late developer's talent. When Bayern triggered his release clause of €4.7m after a tip-off from their Brazilian right-back Rafinha, the headline of a press agency introduced him as the Reds' new \"<em>Schnäppchen-Verteidiger</em>\", a bargain defender.</p><p>\"I was bought to challenge the players they already had,\" Dante says. But he always believed that he could be much more than a squad player. \"You won't regret this,\" he told Rummenigge the moment after signing his contract. They certainly have not.</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bayernmunich\">Bayern Munich</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/bundesligafootball\">Bundesliga</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/europeanfootball\">European club football</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/raphaelhonigstein\">Raphael Honigstein</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He asked me if I will be able to speak to the coaches at the club next year. I don't [know if] I will be able to. To speak about Canillas is like speaking about what is almost a second home for me and my son. It's a great club. But they have a problem – their president loves the press and he loves attention.</p><p>\"He is a fantastic person and treats me and my son very well, but he has this small problem, it's not my problem.\"</p><p>There will surely be no shortage of takers if Mourinho quits Madrid, although he will hope to have won the Champions League and Copa del Rey by then.</p><p>His assessment of his mood was not entirely glowing, though. \"I'm not unhappy at Madrid. I could be happier or less happy, but that could happen anywhere. There is no such thing as the perfect club or the perfect coach,\" he added in quotes carried by AS.</p><p>\"The fundamental thing is to finish the season well.

He asked me if I will be able to speak to the coaches at the club next year. I don't [know if] I will be able to. To speak about Canillas is like speaking about what is almost a second home for me and my son. It's a great club. But they have a problem – their president loves the press and he loves attention.</p><p>\"He is a fantastic person and treats me and my son very well, but he has this small problem, it's not my problem.\"</p><p>There will surely be no shortage of takers if Mourinho quits Madrid, although he will hope to have won the Champions League and Copa del Rey by then.</p><p>His assessment of his mood was not entirely glowing, though. \"I'm not unhappy at Madrid. I could be happier or less happy, but that could happen anywhere. There is no such thing as the perfect club or the perfect coach,\" he added in quotes carried by AS.</p><p>\"The fundamental thing is to finish the season well. We are two games from the Champions League final, not long ago we were 13. Then, when the pressure from those games has passed, we will sit down and come to conclusions.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/jose-mourinho\">José Mourinho</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We all understand we've had some interim managers and the fans and the club would probably be happier if we could get a manager who could stay for more than half a&nbsp;season, or for some period of time.\"</p><p>The future of Lampard, who is two goals from equalling Bobby Tambling's club record of 202, remains uncertain with no new contract offer immediately forthcoming from Chelsea. He said it was \"not right\" to speculate on who would replace Rafael Benítez as Chelsea's 10th manager in as many years, but asked about the return of José Mourinho to Stamford Bridge he said the Portuguese was a \"fantastic manager, one of the legends of the Champions League\".</p><p>\"There's no doubt about his credentials, whether he comes to Chelsea or stays at Real Madrid or whatever club he goes to, I believe he will be successful. That's all he's ever done and from working with him I'm very, very sure of that,\" he said.</p><p>Lampard insisted he was not concerned about still being two goals off the club record with eight or nine games left to play, although he pointedly remarked on the fact he has played less recently under Benítez. \"I'm very proud to be on 200. The manager has changed the team around. I've only played a few games since West Ham [when he last scored] and the manager put me in a deeper role,\" said the 34-year-old.</p><p>\"Goals never come easy. No one gives you goals. The most important thing is to be part of a team performance like the other night when we won. If a get the chance to play in a few games like that I think the goals will come.\"</p><p>Lampard said the club's season would be defined by the run-in. Having bowed out of the Champions League in the group stages and lost an FA Cup semi-final to Manchester City, they are now targeting a top four finish in the Premier League and victory in the Europa League.</p><p>\"It was almost a disaster last season and then we won the Champions League and it became the best season in our history. That's football and you will be judged on your end results. We are in that critical time now, not just the manager but us as players to perform individually and as a team and try and make it successful,\" he said.</p><p>Despite the tumultuous nature of life at Stamford Bridge, he paid tribute to the team's resilience and ability to get results even amid the chaos. \"Every season will have its dips and hard moments and the challenge then is to make sure you don't get too down in those moments and make sure you come back fighting.

We all understand we've had some interim managers and the fans and the club would probably be happier if we could get a manager who could stay for more than half a&nbsp;season, or for some period of time.\"</p><p>The future of Lampard, who is two goals from equalling Bobby Tambling's club record of 202, remains uncertain with no new contract offer immediately forthcoming from Chelsea. He said it was \"not right\" to speculate on who would replace Rafael Benítez as Chelsea's 10th manager in as many years, but asked about the return of José Mourinho to Stamford Bridge he said the Portuguese was a \"fantastic manager, one of the legends of the Champions League\".</p><p>\"There's no doubt about his credentials, whether he comes to Chelsea or stays at Real Madrid or whatever club he goes to, I believe he will be successful. That's all he's ever done and from working with him I'm very, very sure of that,\" he said.</p><p>Lampard insisted he was not concerned about still being two goals off the club record with eight or nine games left to play, although he pointedly remarked on the fact he has played less recently under Benítez. \"I'm very proud to be on 200. The manager has changed the team around. I've only played a few games since West Ham [when he last scored] and the manager put me in a deeper role,\" said the 34-year-old.</p><p>\"Goals never come easy. No one gives you goals. The most important thing is to be part of a team performance like the other night when we won. If a get the chance to play in a few games like that I think the goals will come.\"</p><p>Lampard said the club's season would be defined by the run-in. Having bowed out of the Champions League in the group stages and lost an FA Cup semi-final to Manchester City, they are now targeting a top four finish in the Premier League and victory in the Europa League.</p><p>\"It was almost a disaster last season and then we won the Champions League and it became the best season in our history. That's football and you will be judged on your end results. We are in that critical time now, not just the manager but us as players to perform individually and as a team and try and make it successful,\" he said.</p><p>Despite the tumultuous nature of life at Stamford Bridge, he paid tribute to the team's resilience and ability to get results even amid the chaos. \"Every season will have its dips and hard moments and the challenge then is to make sure you don't get too down in those moments and make sure you come back fighting. This year's had a few of them, getting knocked out of the Champions League, not keeping up our form in the Premier League at times, but the big picture is that you want to be successful at the end of the season,\" he said.</p><p>\"You have to give credit to Chelsea as a club because when people talk about crises and up and down seasons we still find ourselves in with the chance of a cup and Champions League qualification next season, that's quite something.

But the exhibition is not the only thing on the away end's mind. \"Rafa, Rafael, Rafa, Rafael, Rafa, Rafael, Rafael Benítez,\" comes that old familiar sound. Three years on from his unceremonious exit and Benítez's standing at Anfield is not only secure but in many respects enhanced.</p><p>An ulterior motive was of course at work at Wigan. Three days earlier, following an FA Cup fifth round win at Middlesbrough, Benítez had snapped at the Chelsea supporters who welcomed him to the club with outright hostility and a club hierarchy who had placed \"interim\" before his name. His Stamford Bridge days appeared even shorter than planned and Wigan provided opportunity for Liverpool to offer support at Chelsea's expense. Another chance arrives at Anfield on Sunday when Benítez makes his competitive return aiming to strengthen Chelsea's hold on Champions League qualification. It is unlikely to be passed up. Liverpool remember fondly the times he did the same with them.</p><p>Benítez was not universally mourned when his six-year Liverpool reign ended in June 2010. Even staunch admirers grew weary of the infighting and transfer errors that unravelled five previous years of progress in his final season. When the Kop chants his name on Sunday it will not be a declaration of revolt against Rodgers, as was the case when it yearned for Kenny Dalglish to end the torment of Roy Hodgson. And as Fenway Sports Group demonstrated in the search for Dalglish's replacement last summer, when Benítez's credentials were given short shrift, the club's owners wanted a clean slate.</p><p>\"Rafael Benítez will deserve a great welcome,\" said Rodgers, who claims to be unperturbed at the support his predecessor may receive. \"He won the European Cup here, which is a great achievement. There is no question he is a fantastic manager but I had confidence from the owners when I came in here that this process was going to take time. It wasn't going to be instant. And the owners have never wavered from that.\"</p><p>But many supporters did want Benítez back last summer and the memories, however selective, have been enriched during Liverpool's drift to the margins. No European Cup-winning manager is forgotten but Benítez's reputation at Liverpool is down to more than just Istanbul in 2005 and an FA Cup triumph the following year. There were two Champions League finals in three years, a further semi-final and quarter-final appearance, both ending in defeat by Chelsea as the two clubs forged a rivalry that accounts for Benítez's problems now. Throw in victories in Barcelona, Real Madrid, a record points tally for a Liverpool manager in the Premier League era of 86 – enough for the title in most seasons – and the present falls into stark focus.</p><p>Only in Benítez's last campaign did Liverpool fail to qualify for the Champions League and then a place in the final of the Europa League was missed by the fine margin of an away goal against Atlético Madrid. Last week Rodgers claimed Liverpool could benefit from being without European football next season, the argument being a developing squad would concentrate greater energies on a top four finish. It was a sobering reflection on where the expectations that Benítez raised at Liverpool now stand.</p><p>Benítez has not been accepted at Chelsea for the reasons he remains so admired at Liverpool: he fought the team's corner, at any cost, whether against José Mourinho, Sir Alex Ferguson or the regime of the former owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett. He kept Liverpool competitive while they took the club to the brink of administration and he was removed by the then managing director Christian Purslow to appease a few dissenting voices in the dressing room, and to present a less fractious club to prospective buyers. Hence the appointment of a safe pair of hands in Hodgson, a bewildering decision before the benefit of hindsight.</p><p>Benítez was not replaced by a superior manager and Liverpool's slide accelerated to the point where Rodgers arrived with the brief of a major reconstruction job. It is doubtful Benítez would have reduced Liverpool's wage bill by roughly £20m without complaint, as Rodgers has had to do this season, but the Spaniard could also point to the £49m outlay on new players as greater than the transfer budget in his final three years at Anfield. And that's without going into net spend.</p><p>Benítez was guarded about his Anfield return on Friday, mindful of the consternation he recently provoked in Rodgers following comments about wishing to return \"home\" one day. \"I was clear,\" Benítez said. \"My home is there [the Wirral]. My family is there. I cannot change the past. I'm really proud of the rivalry and all these things but it's very clear: my commitment is with Chelsea and I will use common sense and try to get three points. Afterwards, I will wish the best to Liverpool Football Club.\" Nor would he elaborate on whether he was a candidate for the Liverpool job last summer. \"That's something I will not talk about because I don't want any misunderstanding.\"</p><p>Rodgers clearly remains irked at what he perceives as the Spaniard manoeuvring for his job. \"Managers are different,\" he said. \"Some managers will speak about other jobs. Some won't. I won't speak about another manager in a position no matter how much I might want the job. It takes different types.\"</p><p>The present Liverpool manager also made a pointed reference to the two very different clubs that he and Benítez inherited on their arrivals at Anfield. \"It won't be strange [to hear the Kop singing Benítez's name] because the club has always been very respectful towards former players and managers,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm sure Rafael Benítez will get a great reception. It is interesting. In the season he won the Champions League Liverpool finished on 58 points [in the Premier League] and outside the top four. Gérard Houllier had 60 the year before and arrived in fourth. Everyone knows the history of that season and winning the Champions League bought another season in there to move the club forward.\"</p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/brendan-rodgers\">Brendan Rodgers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/rafael-benitez\">Rafael Benítez</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/liverpool\">Liverpool</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andyhunter\">Andy Hunter</a></div><br/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It is about a finely-tuned tactical battle, tension, deep significance and heavyweight recent history. Yet from a Tottenham point of view at least, the spectre of one man appears to have transcended it all.</p><p>The club's players and staff have come to joke about the Gareth Bale effect; specifically, the manner in which no interview or press conference can be allowed to pass without mention of him. They have an extremely valid point. Bale ticks an awful lot of boxes but consider the added extras for the manager André Villas-Boas's media briefing on Friday afternoon.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/19/pfa-luis-suarez-player-year-award\" title=\"\">Bale has just been named on the shortlist for the Professional Footballers' Association's Player of the Year and Young Player&nbsp;of the Year awards</a>. He had given what Villas-Boas called \"a big scare for everybody\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/05/gareth-bale-sprained-ankle-ligaments\" title=\"\">when he rolled his ankle gruesomely on his previous appearance, at home to Basel in the Europa League quarter-final first leg two weeks ago</a> and, having not played since, he had been a doubt for City's visit. His fitness has been newsworthy every day since Tottenham's return to training on Tuesday, after a four‑day break following the penalty shoot-out defeat at Basel. Tottenham were counting on him. Villas-Boas did not stand a chance.</p><p>He delivered the all-important bulletin with the rasping calm that has set the tone for his players' preparations.

A win over City feels vital to reignite the momentum, although Villas-Boas predicted that all of the Champions League hopefuls would drop points over the run-in. Twelve, he added, was the \"minimum requirement\" for his club.

It is about a finely-tuned tactical battle, tension, deep significance and heavyweight recent history. Yet from a Tottenham point of view at least, the spectre of one man appears to have transcended it all.</p><p>The club's players and staff have come to joke about the Gareth Bale effect; specifically, the manner in which no interview or press conference can be allowed to pass without mention of him. They have an extremely valid point. Bale ticks an awful lot of boxes but consider the added extras for the manager André Villas-Boas's media briefing on Friday afternoon.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/19/pfa-luis-suarez-player-year-award\" title=\"\">Bale has just been named on the shortlist for the Professional Footballers' Association's Player of the Year and Young Player&nbsp;of the Year awards</a>. He had given what Villas-Boas called \"a big scare for everybody\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/apr/05/gareth-bale-sprained-ankle-ligaments\" title=\"\">when he rolled his ankle gruesomely on his previous appearance, at home to Basel in the Europa League quarter-final first leg two weeks ago</a> and, having not played since, he had been a doubt for City's visit. His fitness has been newsworthy every day since Tottenham's return to training on Tuesday, after a four‑day break following the penalty shoot-out defeat at Basel. Tottenham were counting on him. Villas-Boas did not stand a chance.</p><p>He delivered the all-important bulletin with the rasping calm that has set the tone for his players' preparations. Bale is \"definitely up for selection\", having trained with the squad on Thursday and Friday. Picking him, Villas-Boas suggested, would not be a gamble. He went on to offer praise to the club's medical department. He resisted the temptation to perform a Ricky Villa-style celebration.</p><p>In other news, Jermain Defoe is back to fitness after an abdominal problem to present Villas-Boas with a teaser up front. Does he persist with Emmanuel Adebayor, who has shown signs of improvement and would be motivated against his former club? Aaron Lennon, though, has not trained because of knee trouble and is unlikely to feature, which is a major blow given the balance that he brings to the team.

I will play him when it is right.</p><p>\"When he started at Tottenham we did not have [Marco] Fellaini or [Steven] Pienaar, the other night we did not have Ossie [Osman].

He has a lot of maturing to do and needs to make sure he does not lose the ball in the wrong areas of the pitch. I can see he has got confidence from the Arsenal game and hopefully that will help.</p><p>\"We have to bring him along and hope we get him better over the next year or two.
