<p>As a side note, the Expo is the second project appearing under the <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">twbs organization</a> (this blog is already there in private mode). We'll be moving Bootstrap and the Customizer over with v3 soon.</p>

Nearly three months has gone by since we pushed out a new version of Bootstrap, but fret not, for that void comes to a most excellent halt tonight. After numerous delays, including a bout with the flu, we're happy to announce the release of <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">Bootstrap 2.3</a>.</p>

<h2>Oh shit what</h2>

<p>Bootstrap 2.3 includes some new features, as well as the standard bunch of bug fixes and docs improvements. Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Repository changes:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Local instead of global dependencies</strong> for our makefile and install process. Now getting started is way easier—just run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
<li>Upgraded to jQuery 1.9. No changes were needed, but we did upgrade the included jQuery file to the latest release.</li>
<li>Moved changelog to be within the repo instead of as a wiki page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New and improved features:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Added carousel indicators!</strong> Add the HTML and it automagically works.</li>
<li><strong>Added <code>container</code> option to tooltips.</strong> The default option is still <code>insertAfter</code>, but now you may specify where to insert tooltips (and by extension, popovers) with the optional container parameter.</li>
<li>Improved popovers now utilize <code>max-width</code> instead of <code>width</code>, have been widened from 240px to 280px, and will automatically hide the title if one has not been set via CSS <code>:empty</code> selector.</li>
<li>Improved tooltip alignment on edges with <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6713\">#6713</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved accessibility for links in all components.</strong> After merging <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6441\">#6441</a>, link hover states now apply to the <code>:focus</code> state as well. This goes for basic <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, as well as buttons, navs, dropdowns, and more.</li>
<li>Added print utility classes to show and hide content between <code>screen</code> and <code>print</code> via CSS.</li>
<li>Updated input groups to make them behave more like default form controls. Added <code>display: inline-block;</code>, increased <code>margin-bottom</code>, and added <code>vertical-align: middle;</code>  to match <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> styles.</li>
<li>Added <code>.horizontal-three-colors()</code> gradient mixin (with example in the CSS tests file).</li>
<li>Added <code>.text-left</code>, <code>.text-center</code>, and <code>.text-right</code> utility classes for easy typographic alignment.</li>
<li>Added <code>@ms-viewport</code> so IE10 can use responsive CSS when in split-screen mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Docs changes:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Added <a href=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/25869/5e2f812c-4afa-11e2-9293-501cd689232d.png\">new justified navigation example</a>.</li>
<li>Added sticky footer with fixed navbar example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>A note on tooltips</h2>

<p>When we <a href=\"/2012-12-08/bootstrap-2-2-2-released\">released 2.2.2</a>, we changed the insertion strategy for tooltips and popovers. Instead of appending to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> by default, they used <code>insertAfter</code>. This change fixed number <code>z-index</code> issues and ultimately makes controlling and styling tooltips much easier for folks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also resulted in a few bugs, namely breaking input groups by interfering with <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/\">adjacent CSS selectors</a>. Instead of reverting the insertion method, <strong>we've added a new <code>container</code> option</strong>. If you run into a situation where <code>insertAfter</code> doesn't work for you, go ahead and set that option to whatever element works best for you.</p>

<h2>Bootstrap 3 update</h2>

<p>As we've previously mentioned, v2.3 is our last planned release before moving onto v3 fulltime (pending any catastrophic fuckups). For the latest, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">follow the Bootstrap 3 pull request</a>. <strong>Otherwise, here's the lowdown:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap 3 will be mobile first.</li>
<li>No more separate responsive CSS file—all in one now, baby.</li>
<li>Dropping support for IE7 and Firefox 3.x.</li>
<li>Grids have been overhauled—now simpler and fluid by default.</li>
<li>Modals are all responsive and shit now.</li>
<li>Dropping submenu support.</li>
<li>Carousel has been redesigned.</li>
<li>Renamed all of the variables to use dashes instead of camelCase.</li>
<li>Dropped image icons in favor of icon font.</li>
<li>JavaScript events are going to be namespaced.</li>
<li>Docs are getting a bit of a reorganization—Scaffolding and Base CSS have been merged into a single page, CSS.</li>
<li>Added a new gallery page to showcase more awesome Bootstrap implementations.</li>
<li>And a whole mess of other changes.</li>
</ul>


<p>And that's just some of the highlights. Again, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">peep the pull request</a> for the most up to date changes as we continue to chip away at this bad boy. Feel free to comment on that, or hit us up on Twitter, for feedback of any kind.</p>

") (published nil "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 -0800 2013") (link nil "http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/02/07/bootstrap-2-3-released/")) (item nil (title nil "Bootstrap 3 plans") (description nil "<p>With 2.2.2 out the door, our attention has shifted almost entirely to the next major update to the project, Bootstrap 3. Things are coming together and we want to give you an update on what's next and give you a chance to share your thoughts.</p>

<h2>Specifics of v3</h2>

<p>Overall, <strong>Bootstrap 3 will be rather narrow in focus</strong> compared to the last major update. In short, we'll drop legacy code, improve responsive CSS, and centralize community efforts. <strong>Specifically, v3 will address the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Migrate <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/\">twitter/bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap-server/\">twitter/bootstrap-server</a>, and mdo/bootstrap-blog (currently a private repo) to the <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">twbs</a> organization.</li>
<li>Change site URLs to <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">http://getbootstrap.com</a> (more on that below).</li>
<li>Compile all Less code, including responsive styles, into a single CSS file.</li>
<li>Drop IE7/FF3x support entirely.</li>
<li>Use the <code>@font-face</code> version of Glyphicons instead of the current PNGs.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2054\">Switch to the MIT license</a> instead of Apache.</li>
<li>Drop the <code>*-wip</code> branch style of development.</li>
<li>Use tags for all versioned downloads, use smaller feature branches for dev work, and merge right into master (after 3.0 launches).</li>
</ul>


<p>To help communicate and track changes, we've opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">Bootstrap 3 pull request</a>. Follow along with what we're working on, ask questions, or contribute by using that pull request as a reference point. We'll be keeping it up to date as development progresses.</p>

<p>In addition, we're going to try to <strong>accelerate versioning</strong> by focusing on individual components for major releases after 3.0 (e.g., modals or the carousel could be punted to a 4.0 release). Given this approach, it's less important for us to stuff a lot of feature work into 3.0.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we're open to addressing a couple of things with 3.0 like form styles and mobile enhancements. We want to limit these kind of changes for 3.0 though, so let us know what features are most important to you.</p>

<h2>New GitHub organization</h2>

<p>We mentioned this a few times in recent months, but with 3.0 we'll be transitioning to a new organization on GitHub, <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">twbs</a>. The username is homage to <a href=\"https://github.com/h5bp\">H5BP</a>, one of the most notable front-end tools out there, and of course, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter\">Twitter</a>. The move shouldn't present any problems to you fine folks.</p>

<h2>New URLs</h2>

<p>With the move to the new organization, the URLs of the Bootstrap docs must change. We host our docs on GitHub Pages and those URLs are based on user or organization names. To better future-proof things, we'll be making <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">http://getbootstrap.com</a> our base URL instead of just a redirect.</p>

<p>For us, this will be the most painful part of the move. Given how prolific links are, we'll also try to setup something at the old URLs to redirect folks, but we're unsure how we will do that just yet. Perhaps a shell repository with dummy pages pointing to their replacements? Time will tell.</p>

<h2>Strengthening the community</h2>

<p>The larger goal behind the organization move is to <strong>bolster the Bootstrap community</strong>. To start, we'll be transferring the main Bootstrap repo, the Heroku customizer app, and the blog to the new organization. But more importantly, we want to <strong>bring community projects into the organization as official projects</strong>.</p>

<p>From language ports to extensions to snippets, we want to work with leaders of key community efforts to see if this makes sense. We're still working on the criteria for this and have yet to reach out to anyone.</p>

<p>If you think your project fits, hit us up. We'll be looking to add projects shortly after 3.0.</p>

<h2>Growing the team</h2>

<p>Bringing additional projects into the fold is going to be a huge undertaking as managing the existing code is already a hefty task between Jacob and myself. To that end, we'll be looking to add one or two people to the team to help us manage issues, pull requests, etc. This is a huge deal for us and we'll be taking our time on figuring it all out.</p>

<p>Growing the team with official contributors, other than the two of us, is also a goal. Similarly, we're super nervous about this and have no clear timetable for it as well.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Bootstrap is still just getting started. There is so much more awesome stuff to do and we want to work with you awesome folks to do it all as best we can. We hope you're as excited as we are.</p>

<p>Please reach out to us on Twitter or GitHub with any questions or feedback.</p>

In hindsight I got a little carried away and forgot about something.</p>

<p><strong>IE7 doesn't really do icon fonts.</strong></p>

<p>I could put together a hack to add IE7 support, duplicating tons of code, but that doesn't feel right as we're dropping IE7 support in BS3. Instead of spending time on something we'll just remove later on, we're going to focus on things that will be here in the next major version.</p>

<p>So, it's with some sadness that I inform you <strong>we will not be including the Glyphicons font in 2.2.2-wip</strong>.</p>

<p>Backwards compatibility is always a pain in the ass, and to avoid huge headaches for folks, we sometimes have to bend over, well, backwards. I hope this doesn't screw up your plans too much and that you understand we have the community's best interests at heart.</p>

After numerous delays, including a bout with the flu, we're happy to announce the release of <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">Bootstrap 2.3</a>.</p>
<h2>Oh shit what</h2>
<p>Bootstrap 2.3 includes some new features, as well as the standard bunch of bug fixes and docs improvements. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repository changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local instead of global dependencies</strong> for our makefile and install process. Now getting started is way easier—just run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
<li>Upgraded to jQuery 1.9. No changes were needed, but we did upgrade the included jQuery file to the latest release.</li>
<li>Moved changelog to be within the repo instead of as a wiki page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New and improved features:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Added carousel indicators!</strong> Add the HTML and it automagically works.</li>
<li><strong>Added <code>container</code> option to tooltips.</strong> The default option is still <code>insertAfter</code>, but now you may specify where to insert tooltips (and by extension, popovers) with the optional container parameter.</li>
<li>Improved popovers now utilize <code>max-width</code> instead of <code>width</code>, have been widened from 240px to 280px, and will automatically hide the title if one has not been set via CSS <code>:empty</code> selector.</li>
<li>Improved tooltip alignment on edges with <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6713\">#6713</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved accessibility for links in all components.</strong> After merging <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6441\">#6441</a>, link hover states now apply to the <code>:focus</code> state as well. This goes for basic <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, as well as buttons, navs, dropdowns, and more.</li>
<li>Added print utility classes to show and hide content between <code>screen</code> and <code>print</code> via CSS.</li>
<li>Updated input groups to make them behave more like default form controls. Added <code>display: inline-block;</code>, increased <code>margin-bottom</code>, and added <code>vertical-align: middle;</code>  to match <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> styles.</li>
<li>Added <code>.horizontal-three-colors()</code> gradient mixin (with example in the CSS tests file).</li>
<li>Added <code>.text-left</code>, <code>.text-center</code>, and <code>.text-right</code> utility classes for easy typographic alignment.</li>
<li>Added <code>@ms-viewport</code> so IE10 can use responsive CSS when in split-screen mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Docs changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/25869/5e2f812c-4afa-11e2-9293-501cd689232d.png\">new justified navigation example</a>.</li>

<h2>A note on tooltips</h2>
<p>When we <a href=\"/2012-12-08/bootstrap-2-2-2-released\">released 2.2.2</a>, we changed the insertion strategy for tooltips and popovers. Instead of appending to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> by default, they used <code>insertAfter</code>. This change fixed number <code>z-index</code> issues and ultimately makes controlling and styling tooltips much easier for folks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also resulted in a few bugs, namely breaking input groups by interfering with <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/\">adjacent CSS selectors</a>. Instead of reverting the insertion method, <strong>we've added a new <code>container</code> option</strong>. If you run into a situation where <code>insertAfter</code> doesn't work for you, go ahead and set that option to whatever element works best for you.</p>
<h2>Bootstrap 3 update</h2>
<p>As we've previously mentioned, v2.3 is our last planned release before moving onto v3 fulltime (pending any catastrophic fuckups). For the latest, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">follow the Bootstrap 3 pull request</a>. <strong>Otherwise, here's the lowdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap 3 will be mobile first.</li>
<li>No more separate responsive CSS file—all in one now, baby.</li>
<li>Dropping support for IE7 and Firefox 3.x.</li>
<li>Grids have been overhauled—now simpler and fluid by default.</li>
<li>Modals are all responsive and shit now.</li>
<li>Dropping submenu support.</li>
<li>Carousel has been redesigned.</li>
<li>Renamed all of the variables to use dashes instead of camelCase.</li>
<li>Dropped image icons in favor of icon font.</li>
<li>JavaScript events are going to be namespaced.</li>
<li>Docs are getting a bit of a reorganization—Scaffolding and Base CSS have been merged into a single page, CSS.</li>
<li>Added a new gallery page to showcase more awesome Bootstrap implementations.</li>
<li>And a whole mess of other changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's just some of the highlights. Again, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">peep the pull request</a> for the most up to date changes as we continue to chip away at this bad boy. Feel free to comment on that, or hit us up on Twitter, for feedback of any kind.</p>

Things are coming together and we want to give you an update on what's next and give you a chance to share your thoughts.</p>
<h2>Specifics of v3</h2>
<p>Overall, <strong>Bootstrap 3 will be rather narrow in focus</strong> compared to the last major update. In short, we'll drop legacy code, improve responsive CSS, and centralize community efforts. <strong>Specifically, v3 will address the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/\">twitter/bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap-server/\">twitter/bootstrap-server</a>, and mdo/bootstrap-blog (currently a private repo) to the <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">twbs</a> organization.</li>
<li>Change site URLs to <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">http://getbootstrap.com</a> (more on that below).</li>
<li>Compile all Less code, including responsive styles, into a single CSS file.</li>
<li>Drop IE7/FF3x support entirely.</li>
<li>Use the <code>@font-face</code> version of Glyphicons instead of the current PNGs.</li>
<li><a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2054\">Switch to the MIT license</a> instead of Apache.</li>
<li>Drop the <code>*-wip</code> branch style of development.</li>
<li>Use tags for all versioned downloads, use smaller feature branches for dev work, and merge right into master (after 3.0 launches).</li>
</ul>
<p>To help communicate and track changes, we've opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\">Bootstrap 3 pull request</a>. Follow along with what we're working on, ask questions, or contribute by using that pull request as a reference point. We'll be keeping it up to date as development progresses.</p>
<p>In addition, we're going to try to <strong>accelerate versioning</strong> by focusing on individual components for major releases after 3.0 (e.g., modals or the carousel could be punted to a 4.0 release). Given this approach, it's less important for us to stuff a lot of feature work into 3.0.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we're open to addressing a couple of things with 3.0 like form styles and mobile enhancements. We want to limit these kind of changes for 3.0 though, so let us know what features are most important to you.</p>
<h2>New GitHub organization</h2>
<p>We mentioned this a few times in recent months, but with 3.0 we'll be transitioning to a new organization on GitHub, <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs\">twbs</a>. The username is homage to <a href=\"https://github.com/h5bp\">H5BP</a>, one of the most notable front-end tools out there, and of course, <a href=\"https://github.com/twitter\">Twitter</a>. The move shouldn't present any problems to you fine folks.</p>
<h2>New URLs</h2>
<p>With the move to the new organization, the URLs of the Bootstrap docs must change. We host our docs on GitHub Pages and those URLs are based on user or organization names. To better future-proof things, we'll be making <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">http://getbootstrap.com</a> our base URL instead of just a redirect.</p>
<p>For us, this will be the most painful part of the move. Given how prolific links are, we'll also try to setup something at the old URLs to redirect folks, but we're unsure how we will do that just yet. Perhaps a shell repository with dummy pages pointing to their replacements? Time will tell.</p>
<h2>Strengthening the community</h2>
<p>The larger goal behind the organization move is to <strong>bolster the Bootstrap community</strong>. To start, we'll be transferring the main Bootstrap repo, the Heroku customizer app, and the blog to the new organization. But more importantly, we want to <strong>bring community projects into the organization as official projects</strong>.</p>
<p>From language ports to extensions to snippets, we want to work with leaders of key community efforts to see if this makes sense. We're still working on the criteria for this and have yet to reach out to anyone.</p>
<p>If you think your project fits, hit us up. We'll be looking to add projects shortly after 3.0.</p>
<h2>Growing the team</h2>
<p>Bringing additional projects into the fold is going to be a huge undertaking as managing the existing code is already a hefty task between Jacob and myself. To that end, we'll be looking to add one or two people to the team to help us manage issues, pull requests, etc. This is a huge deal for us and we'll be taking our time on figuring it all out.</p>
<p>Growing the team with official contributors, other than the two of us, is also a goal. Similarly, we're super nervous about this and have no clear timetable for it as well.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is still just getting started. There is so much more awesome stuff to do and we want to work with you awesome folks to do it all as best we can. We hope you're as excited as we are.</p>

<p>Bootstrap is still just getting started. There is so much more awesome stuff to do and we want to work with you awesome folks to do it all as best we can. We hope you're as excited as we are.</p>
